We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Lee Cooperman's Top 15 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mr. Cooper Group Inc. (NASDAQ:COOP) stands against Lee Cooperman's other long-term stock picks. Leon Cooperman is a highly respected figure in the investment world, known for his acumen, philanthropy, and candid commentary on markets and economics. As the founder of Omega Advisors, Cooperman built a reputation as one of Wall Street’s most successful hedge fund managers. Leon Cooperman was born in New York in 1943 to working-class immigrant parents. His father was a plumber, and his mother was a homemaker. Cooperman earned his undergraduate degree from Hunter College in 1964 and later pursued an MBA at Columbia Business School. Cooperman began his professional journey at Goldman Sachs, where he worked for 25 years. He joined the firm as an analyst and rose through the ranks to lead the Asset Management division. His tenure at Goldman Sachs was marked by significant achievements, including his role in expanding the firm's institutional investment management services. In 1991, Cooperman left Goldman Sachs to establish Omega Advisors, a hedge fund specializing in value-oriented investing. He built the firm on principles of thorough research, disciplined risk management, and a long-term investment horizon. Under his leadership, Omega Advisors delivered strong returns, earning a reputation as one of the most successful hedge funds in the industry.

At its height, Omega Advisors managed approximately $10 billion in assets, attracting institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals. In 2018, when Cooperman transitioned the firm into a family office, Omega Advisors had around $3.6 billion in AUM. Over its 27 years as a hedge fund, Omega Advisors achieved annualized returns of approximately 12%, outperforming many of its peers and major indices during key periods. During bullish market cycles, Cooperman’s ability to identify undervalued stocks enabled the fund to outperform benchmarks like the S&P 500, which has an average historical return of around 10% annually. For instance, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Cooperman’s investments in financials, industrials, and energy sectors delivered double-digit gains.

Title: Ethereum Market Takeover: Expert Predicts Surge To $14,000 In Six Months

Time Published: 2025-01-20T18:30:15Z

In a thread on X today, January 20, Dennis Liu (@VirtualBacon0x), a general partner at Momentum 6, laid out a bold forecast for Ethereum (ETH), suggesting the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency could reach a price target of $14,000 by the end of 2025. Liu also contends that the next six months will be pivotal, highlighting ETH’s potential to “dominate the market” through June. “Ethereum is about to dominate the market, you don’t want to miss this window,” Liu wrote. “Ethereum has been lagging behind Bitcoin this cycle, but that’s about to change. I believe ETH will shine in the next 6 months.” Despite ETH’s growing adoption, Liu argues that its underperformance relative to Bitcoin stems from “institutional timing.” According to him: “ETH is institutionally driven, unlike Bitcoin or retail-favored altcoins. ETFs provide stability and utility, making ETH ideal for institutional investors.” Liu suggests institutions have been waiting for market conditions to improve and sees 2025 as the year when these conditions finally align. Liu also points to the US Federal Reserve’s policy shifts as a catalyst for ETH’s growth. He notes that since May 2024, the Fed has been slowing its balance sheet reductions, and a possible pivot toward renewed liquidity injections could occur after the January 29 or March 19 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. “Since May 2024, the Fed has slowed balance sheet reductions, signaling a pivot. A liquidity boost could follow Jan 29 or Mar 19 FOMC meetings. Why it matters: Fed liquidity pumps historically drive ETH/BTC higher.” He concludes that such a move by the Fed “means ETH outperformance” could be on the horizon. Citing a decade of market data, Liu claims ETH typically outperforms Bitcoin from January to June, while Bitcoin tends to lead from July to December. “From January to June, ETH consistently outperforms Bitcoin. … If you’re holding ETH, now until June is historically the best window for gains.” Liu also highlights potential pro-ETH sentiments from the Trump administration, referencing the former president’s NFT collections and DeFi platform built on Ethereum: “His NFT collections and DeFi platform are built on Ethereum. Trump’s administration plans to replace SEC leadership, revisiting anti-DeFi rulings. Institutional optimism surged after Trump’s election win in Nov 2024, driving ETF inflows.” He concludes that “pro-crypto policies will directly benefit Ethereum-focused DeFi.” Further emphasizing Ethereum’s institutional strength, Liu points to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization initiatives by major firms like BlackRock and prominent DeFi platforms such as AAVE, MakerDAO, and OriginTrail: “Ethereum isn’t leading meme coin or AI trends – it’s powering serious institutional growth.” Liu underscores a notable shift in Ethereum ETF inflows, which turned positive in November 2024 after a period of outflows: “ETFs added $6B in net inflows from Nov to Jan, or 0.76% of ETH supply/month. … Institutions are buying more ETH than BTC monthly, signaling growing confidence in Ethereum as an asset.” Projecting out to 2025, Liu believes ETH could quadruple to $14,000 if Bitcoin doubles to $200,000, citing Ethereum’s historical tendency to outperform Bitcoin by an additional factor of two: “If Bitcoin doubles to $200K, ETH could 4x to $14K, following its historical outperformance (2x on top of BTC). … While diminishing returns may limit upside, ETH remains a high-conviction bet for this cycle.” Summarizing his perspective, Liu stresses that a confluence of factors—from renewed Fed liquidity to potential pro-DeFi policies—creates a near-term window of opportunity for Ethereum: “With ETF inflows rising, the Fed’s potential liquidity injection, Trump’s pro-DeFi stance, and ETH’s seasonal strength, all the catalysts are aligned. … Ethereum’s time to shine is now until June. I’d rather be overexposed than miss this opportunity.” At press time, ETH traded at $106,929. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Can The Washington Post save itself?

Time Published: 2025-01-20T18:10:57Z

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Staffers plead with Jeff Bezos amidst a talent exodus The Washington Post is one of the most storied organizations in American journalism. But it is in crisis, losing reporting talent, suffering a loss of readers and facing a staff rebellion against publisher Will Lewis. The Post has been swamped by "one debacle after another," since Lewis took charge of the newspaper a year ago, said NPR. The decision by the owner (and billionaire Amazon founder) Jeff Bezos to cancel the Post's traditional presidential endorsement in an apparent effort to placate newly-inaugurated President Donald Trump was a huge blow, causing "hundreds of thousands of subscribers" to cancel their subscriptions. Layoffs have led to fewer journalists on the job, contributing to plummeting morale that led some of the survivors to flee for jobs elsewhere. A "clear vision" to put the Post back on track to journalistic and financial success remains "elusive," said NPR. More than 400 Post staffers last week sent a letter to Bezos asking him to "get personally involved to turn the paper back in the right direction," said Poynter. The staffers said in the letter they were "deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions" that caused readers to bolt. They asked for a face-to-face meeting with Bezos in the service of "restoring trust that has been lost." Bezos did not immediately reply. Escape your echo chamber.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. Bezos has "plunged my beloved Washington Post into darkness," said Eleanor Clift at The Daily Beast. Post reporters have done a "first-rate job covering Trump," but Bezos' decision to pacify the incoming president (with the non-endorsement, as well Amazon's $40 million expense on a documentary about Melania Trump) has raised the specter their journalism could be "compromised by anything that could damage Bezos' financial interests." Bezos' decision to get on Trump's good side "has ramifications far beyond the Post newsroom." If the Post is to remain viable, it must "retain, not lose, its talent," Margaret Sullivan said at The Guardian. It's not "unreasonable to question" whether the Post can maintain its independence in the Trump era, and "Bezos may not care." But if he does care, he should "show up — soon" in the newsroom to talk to reporters, and recommit to the "importance of editorial freedom." He should also dump Lewis, who has overseen a rapid decline in the Post's standing. For the sake of both journalism and "democracy itself, I sure hope he finds a way to do it." On the eve of Trump's inauguration, the Post unveiled a new mission statement: "Riveting Storytelling for All of America." The slogan is intended as an "internal rallying point for employees," said The New York Times. And the paper's chief strategy officer has announced a goal of reaching 200 million paying users. That's an audacious target: The Post currently has fewer than 3 million digital subscribers.

Title: Content Americas 2025: The Confab’s No. 1 Question, a Movie Renaissance, What Buyers Want, Brazil and Deals to Date
URL: https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/content-americas-key-themes-and-major-takeaways-1236279425/

By John Hopewell Chief International Correspondent MIAMI — The best thing about the Miami Hilton Downtown is its vistas from above Biscayne Bay and opposite the city’s iconic serried strip of high-rises. Delegates at Content Americas, which begins its third edition this Monday, will be hoping that the market will afford an equally panoramic view of the international TV business. That’s crucial. Few areas of the world became so dependent on global platform investment as Latin America during the pandemic. Bucking worldwide trends, series season orders actually soared in Spain over 2024, shooting up from 43 a year earlier to 75, according to Ampere Analysis. “Content Americas is the first TV event of the year and, therefore, an opportunity to test, by talking to folks, your incoming hypotheses about how market trends will play out,” says Gaumont USA’s Christian Gabela. Related Stories VIP+ A Decade of Data Supports Sports’ Domination of Broadcast TV The Weeknd's Billions Club Live Concert Film Available to Stream on Spotify As of Sunday, participation sits at just short of 2,000 delegates and 175 exhibitors, edging up from compared to 2024. Popular on Variety That slight increase reflects the fact that, when it comes to Latin America, most all players have attended from last, with Content Americas serving as both a market and production meet, connecting major players from Latin America, the U.S. Hispanic and Spain. Some urgent, specific questions need answering. One case in point: After across-the-board top exec layoffs and departures, effective from December, how will Televisa-Univisión streaming service ViX handle acquisitions? The big question delegates hope Content Americas will address echoes across the world: After a severe corrective in 2023, will global TV streamers in any way be back in the saddle driving growth in Latin America? Don’t Expect Easy Answers Content Americas attendees shouldn’t expect easy answers. “Global streamers are still in different phases — some are consolidating, some are driving toward profitability, and some are business as usual. It’s hard to know what the next year will look like. This unpredictability represents a challenging time for producers,” says Erik Barmack at L.A.-based Wild Sheep Content. Sales cycles have slowed dramatically after the launch of original production across the region, from Netflix’s “Club of Crows” in 2015 to Paramount+ and HBO Max service bows in 2021. 2024: As Bad As It Gets? There is a dire need for visibility, however. Some stats set to be fired off at Content Americas will make for startling viewing. In 2022, major global streamers – Netflix, Amazon, Apple, WBD, Disney, Comcast and Paramount – made 69 season orders in Brazil. By 2024, that figure was down to 28. Mexico’s 49 commissions in 2022 plunged 27% to 36 in 2024. Given global streamers have been the fundamental industry driver of recent years – and lifeboat in 2020 – their corrective plays out over the whole industry. One-year results, however, can be hugely misleading. In some countries, such as Brazil with Globo, incumbents are still highly important. One bottom line is that buoyed by ad tiers, SVOD players will continue to grow their subscription bases in Latin America, Netflix from 51 million in 2024 to 69.5 million in 2029, Omdia predicts. Some established players, such as NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises, look bullish on production growth. Its chairman, Luis Fernández, will deliver one of the most awaited keynotes at this year’s Content Americas. “At a time when Telemundo is the most-watched network in prime time, we are super-charging our scripted content production under one strong brand: Telemundo Studios,” Fernández told Variety last April. A Stabler Market The bottom line, per industry consensus, however, is that far fewer originals will be produced in Latin America in the future compared to the explosion of orders in the recent past. Producers hope, at least, that the market will settle. “2024 was clearly a year where streamers’ budgets for “originals” became increasingly under pressure,” says Gabela. “Our hope is that there’s greater stability in that regard in 2025.” Ringing the Changes “Stabler” is another way of suggesting that, of course, money will be tight throughout the industry. So the story of 2025’s Content Americas may well be producers’ and distributors’ reactions to that. “Independents need to be creative now about financing plans that incorporate multiple territories, to be clever about understanding public funds and the general ecosystems in particular markets,” says Barmack. There are some more obvious ways forward that are already on the radar. “Last year, as streamers cut back on commissioning projects, co-production and windowing became the talk of the town. In 2025, I think we’ll see more of those conversations materialize into deals as the industry readjusts,” says Gabela. “Fewer originals means the need for more co-productions and invites us to be creative to find the financing,” agrees EO Media’s Eze Olzanski. Movies: A TV Industry Future At least in the English-speaking world, there’s a kind of rebound in films from A24, Blumhouse, and Neon with “Longlegs” and “Terrifier,” for example, auteur genre films with talent cast against type. “[Creative] talent can make the difference and become a part of the business equation, and the payoff can be really, really high,” says Fremantle’s Manuel Martí. Gaumont USA, with Pasajero, has produced Netflix’s “The Biggest Fan” with Kate del Castillo as it sets up remakes of its classic film catalog at platforms. The Mediapro Studio has scored one of its most significant hits in 2024 with “El 47,” the frontrunner at February’s Spanish Academy Goya Awards. “I think the sector’s going back in some ways to what it was before,” Olzanski tells Variety, noting that global streamer production is ever more ‘local for local,’ though local may be one territory and fewer projects will be for all Latin America or aim for global.” Selectivity Volume for volume’s sake is a waning philosophy: “Independents need to be pickier, frankly, about projects. Not all of this pullback is bad — it’s forcing higher standards that the industry could use,” Barmack observes. Olzanski agrees. “The industry is finding its new balance, understanding its current size, how much it can produce and sell, and working for that size. It’s a moment of honesty for the industry.” “Reducing the number of productions and releases, particularly releases, might seem a bad thing, but on the positive side, gives more visibility and value to launches,” he adds. What Will Buyers Be Buying? There was a time – broadly last decade – when experiments ran wild at pay-TV operators and an early Netflix. From the turn of this decade broadly, a pivot occurred: “Creators are working with known genres and frameworks and then trying to reinvent them,” Berlinale Series head Julia Fidel noted in 2022. Now, “series are genre layering, layering one genre on top of another,” said Fremantle’s Manuel Marti. One part political exposé, another part espionage thriller, “Yosi, The Regretful Spy,” whose Season 2 competes for a Rose d’Or Latino, is one case in point. Another contender, the Natalia Beristáin showrun “Midnight Family,” from Fremantle and Fabula, melds a reality-sourced medical thriller and family drama. Series, Martí points out, will remain plot-driven, “making you want to see the whole season,” and character-driven, “making you come again for the second season.” Character-driven drama is, moreover, on the rise. “I guess at the Emmys, both ‘Shogun’ and ‘The Bear’ were character-driven, which is what people especially crave,” Martí observes. More Buyer Interests Beyond that, “Regular, returnable and franchiseable content will be the most attractive,” says Ampere’s Fred Black. “Particularly crime dramas, which work globally and are produced internationally.” On distribution, apart from the more relevant new launches, buyers are moving ever more into non-exclusive deals, says Olzanski. On the local side, “we’ve gone back to a more normal thing with the usual slots for television: Action, natural disasters, a family, kids, co-viewing, and so on,” he adds. The production of fewer originals doesn’t mean that streamers will be acquiring more, he cautioned, “and that is part of finding the new balance.” Brazil “Thanks to the global presence of the streamers, Brazilian producers’ content has been watched outside the country, which was great for them, and now they want more. Being in such a huge market, having success abroad is a newly acquired desire, not necessarily a need,” says Martí. Also, he notes that global streamers look set to be obliged to invest a percentage of gross revenues in Brazilian content. Content Americas 2025 takes place, also, as “I’m Still Here” scored a best actress award for Fernanda Torres and “Senna,” praised for its production values, has played in Netflix’s global Top 10 non-English TV charts. It’s a special moment for the international industry to see Brazil as a key production center,” says Luis Toledo, the former highly active Spcine exec, who is launching Filomena Productions to connect Brazil, Latin America and the global South with established international markets. “This is exactly the reason for creating Filomena. To “prove” or guarantee to the more developed film markets that the global South can deliver the same quality but with lower prices and also new stories/narratives. The world can’t stand watching ‘Fast and Furious’ number 156 anymore.” Deals to Date *El Estudio, partnering with L.A.-based Happy Accidents, has acquired adaptation rights to ”Here Come the Habibs,” a fish-out-of-water Australian comedy about a Lebanese family.

A virtual drone was piloted through an obstacle course by a person imagining moving their fingers Willsey et al. A man with paralysis who had electrodes implanted in his brain can pilot a virtual drone through an obstacle course simply by imagining moving his fingers. His brain signals are interpreted by an AI model and then used to control a simulated drone. Brain-computer interface (BCI) research has made huge strides in recent years, allowing people with paralysis to precisely control a mouse cursor and dictate speech to computers by imagining writing words with a pen. But so far, they haven’t yet shown great promise in complex applications with multiple inputs. Read moreMind-reading AI recreates what you're looking at with amazing accuracy Read more Mind-reading AI recreates what you're looking at with amazing accuracy Advertisement Now, Matthew Willsey at the University of Michigan and his colleagues have created an algorithm that allows a user to trigger four discrete signals by imagining moving their fingers and thumb. The anonymous man who tried the technology has tetraplegia due to a spinal cord injury. He had already been fitted with a BCI from Blackrock Neurotech made up of 192 electrodes, implanted in the area of the brain that controls hand motion. An AI model was used to map the complex neural signals received by the electrodes to the user’s thoughts. The participant learned how to think of the first two fingers of one hand moving, creating an electrical signal that can be made stronger or weaker. Another signal was generated by the second two fingers and another two by the thumb. The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. These were sufficient to allow the user to control a virtual drone by thought alone, and with practice he could skilfully pilot it through an obstacle course. Willsey says the experiment could have been done using a real drone, but was kept virtual for ease and safety. “The goal of doing the quadcopter was really kind of shared between our lab and the participant,” says Willsey. “For him, it was the realisation of kind of a dream that he thought was lost once he suffered his injury. He had a passion and a dream for flying. He seemed very empowered and enabled; he would have us take videos and send it to friends.” Although the results are impressive, there is still much to be done before BCIs can be reliably used for complex tasks, says Willsey. Firstly, AI is needed to interpret signals from the electrodes, and this relies on individual training for every user. Secondly, this training needs to be repeated over time as functionality declines, which may be due to electrodes shifting slightly in the brain or changes in the brain itself.

Title: Netflix’s Expected Q4 Subscriber Bonanza Should Get Earnings Season Off To A Fast Start

By Dade Hayes Business Editor As is the case with most Netflix earnings reports, the question for the company on Tuesday isn’t whether the number of subscribers will rise – it’s about just how high the number can go. Most Wall Street analysts expect a marked surge in the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31, driven by the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight, two NFL games and series premieres like Squid Game‘s second season. The report by Netflix, coming on the first full day of President Donald Trump’s second term, will kick off a five-week period of fresh media and tech financial results. The numbers and executive comments, a burst after the annual holiday lull, will offer the first signals about the trajectory of 2025. Related Stories News 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming News More 'Moana' Moola! Sequel Crests $1B Worldwide; 3rd Disney Release Of 2024 To Milestone As Studio Now Counts 32 Billion-Dollar Global Grossers Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox Corp. are expected to weigh in on their failed joint streaming venture, Venu Sports, and Comcast will brief Wall Street on progress with NBCUniversal cable network spinoff it announced last November, and Paramount Global will offer updates on the company’s pending merger with Skydance Media. Big Tech leaders will also make their voices heard after flocking to Washington for Trump’s inauguration. Watch on Deadline Netflix is expected to add 8.2 million subscribers in the quarter, reaching 290.9 million, according to the consensus forecast by Wall Street analysts. Given the company’s momentum surging at the end of December, estimates are undergoing upward revision. A survey of 45 buy-side analysts conducted by Guggenheim Securities found that 70% of them are calling for at least 11.1 million net adds in the quarter, and 29% are now north of 13.1 million. This is the last quarter when the streaming leader plans to report subscriber numbers, shifting its emphasis to revenue and operating margin, along with audience metrics like engagement. Tim Nollen of Macquarie believes the timing of the subscriber disclosure end is not accidental. “It is possible subscription growth will slow from here as paid sharing enforcement has largely cycled through,” he wrote in a note to clients, “but a slowing rate of sub growth does not necessarily mean slower growth for the company overall.” Nollen sees the company adding more than 10 million subscribers in the quarter, with “a decent chance” the tally ends up even higher, one reason he upped his 12-month price target on Netflix shares to $965, from $795. Alicia Reese of Wedbush Securities sees the company’s 2-year-old advertising business becoming a primary driver of revenue by 2026. In a recent research note, she maintained her “outperform” rating on Netflix stock at a 12-month target of $950. “Netflix has established a virtually insurmountable lead in the streaming wars,” she wrote. “Netflix can retain its moat while competitors try to replicate its business model. … With global content creation, balancing costs, and increasing profitability, Netflix has reached the right formula.” Among the questions Netflix will like face during its self-mediated earnings call (in which its head of investor relations selects and groups analyst queries as opposed to an open conference-call format) concern price hikes, advertising growth and the strategy for live sports. The streaming giant announced just before Christmas that it acquired rights to multiple editions of the FIFA Women’s World Cup, adding to the multi-year NFL relationship launched in 2024. Sports-adjacent WWE Raw also began weekly live airings earlier this month under a multi-year rights deal, adding a potent draw to the ad tier, which is where Netflix is focusing its energy. Disney is executing a similar streaming strategy. With its portfolio finally profitable five years after the launch of flagship Disney+, the company is pushing more customers toward the cheaper, ad-supported option. It also mimicked Netflix’s effort to force anyone sharing passwords to pay for the privilege. Like its media peers, Disney faces a number of other challenges. The L.A. wildfires, which got the year off to a catastrophic start, especially for many entertainment industry workers, will factor into the company’s earnings report even though they broke out after the quarter’s end. In a recent note to clients reaffirming her “buy” rating on Disney but raising some concerns, BofA Securities analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote that it “does not appear the recent LA fires have had a material impact on Disneyland attendance.” Even so, she sees “potential risk” to forecasts for incremental costs due to the need for temporary employee housing and business disruption. The quarter ending 2024, which is officially the first quarter of Disney’s fiscal year, which began last fall, “will be the trough quarter of this fiscal year” for the company’s Experiences division, Ehrlich predicts. The impact of two recent hurricanes, along with cruise ship pre-opening costs, will weigh on results. And then there is Venu, which was scrapped before ever launching. Announced with fanfare in February 2024 by JV partners Disney, Fox and WBD, it was sued on antitrust grounds by pay-TV provider Fubo. As part of a settlement reached this month, Disney said it would acquire 70% of Fubo. All three partners are likely to be asked to quantify their investment in Venu. During the trial, it was revealed that the tab had exceeded $50 million as the streaming offering was designed and staffed by more than 100 employees. Shutdown costs are likely to add millions more at an inopportune time given the austerity drive and cutbacks rippling through the traditional media sector. With a mixed bag including better movie studio results but disappointing NBA ratings and expenses for things like password sharing and other streaming initiatives, Ehrlich sees “several moving parts” and “unknowns” in play for Disney. Big Tech executives at Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, meanwhile, usually keep their strategic cards close to the vest as they report earnings. This time, they will be speaking to investors shortly after gathering together in Washington, D.C. In throwing their support behind President-elect Trump along with major tech figures like Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen, the companies are hoping to be rewarded for their loyalty. Trump’s first term was marked by combative and acrimonious relations with the companies, many of which ultimately banned him from their platforms. President Biden’s administration has seen a number of regulatory actions aiming to rein in the companies’ power. Despite a parting warning from Biden about the “oligarchs” attempting to influence American democracy, a shared priority has taken shape among tech companies and government officials: making money through innovation. That’s a political message Wall Street can always endorse. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Title: Trump buzz drives $2.2B inflow, setting new records for Bitcoin and AUM

Market enthusiasm for Trump's era catalyzes all-time high for Bitcoin and trading volumes. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The crypto market has recorded its highest weekly inflow this year, reaching an impressive $2.2 billion. According to the latest CoinShares report, this influx of capital was fueled by growing excitement around Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. The firm noted that the surge pushed total year-to-date inflows to $2.8 billion. This influx has also pushed assets under management (AUM) to a record high of $171 billion. The surge coincided with Bitcoin’s impressive performance, with the flagship crypto climbing nearly 20% over the past week to hit an all-time high near the $110,000 mark. Meanwhile, the market also experienced a corresponding spike in exchange-traded product (ETP) trading volumes, which reached $21 billion last week. James Butterfill, CoinShares head of research, pointed out that this number accounted for 34% of Bitcoin’s trading activity on leading exchanges. This robust number highlights growing institutional interest and the increasing mainstream adoption of crypto. Bitcoin continued its dominance, securing $1.9 billion in inflows last week and bringing its total for the year to $2.7 billion. The report highlighted that spot Bitcoin ETFs, offered by key players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, and Bitwise, collectively attracted over $2.1 billion in inflows. The inflows are seen as a positive response to market optimism about supportive regulatory policies expected under the incoming administration. Interestingly, short-Bitcoin products registered modest inflows of $500,000, a surprising deviation from typical bearish behavior during bullish trends. Meanwhile, Ethereum drew $246 million in inflows, marking a reversal of its previous outflows this year. However, the second-largest crypto continues to underperform in comparison to its peers. Butterfill noted that Ethereum remains the weakest performer this year from an inflow perspective despite significantly outpacing Solana, which brought in $2.5 million last week. On the other hand, XRP has proven to be a standout performer, attracting $31 million in inflows last week. Since mid-November 2024, XRP’s total inflows have reached an impressive $484 million, underscoring its growing appeal to investors. Stellar followed with smaller inflows of $2.1 million, while other altcoins showed little activity during the period. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Trump’s ‘Drill Baby Drill’ - Why SLB Could Lead Energy Sector In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdaugherty/2025/01/20/trumps-drill-baby-drillwhy-slb-could-lead-energy-sector-in-2025/

"Drill Baby Drill!" The signature energy battle cry of Donald Trump has returned to center stage as he returns to the White House. His vision for American energy dominance is taking shape with the nomination of Chris Wright, a vocal advocate for fossil fuels, as his choice for Energy Secretary. Wright, 60, made his position clear during his Senate confirmation hearing last week: "Previous administrations have viewed energy as a liability instead of the immense national asset that it is." His appointment signals a dramatic shift from current energy policies, with a laser focus on expanding domestic production across multiple sectors. The Liberty Energy CEO, who is expected to win Senate confirmation, brings a unique perspective to the role. "To compete globally, we must expand energy production, including commercial nuclear and liquefied natural gas, and cut the cost of energy for Americans," Wright declared during his hearing. His stance represents a stark contrast to the Biden administration's pause on LNG export approvals and restrictions on federal land drilling. The focus on expanded energy production extends beyond the Department of Energy. Interior Secretary nominee Doug Burgum reinforced this agenda during his confirmation hearing, pledging to vigorously pursue maximizing energy production from U.S. public lands and waters as a national security imperative. His comments signal a dramatic reversal from the Biden administration's efforts to limit oil and gas drilling through reduced federal lease auctions and offshore development restrictions aimed at addressing climate change. Wright's vision extends beyond traditional energy sources. As an MIT-trained engineer who studied fusion energy, he supports developing small nuclear power reactors and geothermal energy, while expressing skepticism about the sufficiency of solar and wind power. "The solution to climate change is to evolve our energy system," Wright told the Senate energy committee, adding, "Do I wish we could make faster progress, absolutely." This pragmatic approach to energy transition aligns with Trump's broader energy independence agenda. CLEVELAND, OH (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) For investors looking to capitalize on this shift in energy policy, SLB (formerly Schlumberger) presents a compelling opportunity. The company's strong market position was recently highlighted by a 6% surge in its stock price on Friday's trading following better-than-expected Q4 adjusted earnings, driven by robust demand for its drilling equipment and technology. The company's confidence in its future is demonstrated by its dividend increase and announcement of a $2.3 billion stock buyback program. As the largest service provider to the oil and gas industry, SLB's global presence across more than 100 countries positions it uniquely to benefit from expanded domestic energy production. The company's Q4 performance, particularly strong gains in its digital and integration business, showcases its technological leadership and operational efficiency. While the energy sector's cyclical nature presents inherent challenges, SLB's valuation suggest significant upside potential. Trading at less than 11 times earnings with a 3% dividend yield, the stock appears undervalued. SLB's aggressive share buyback program and strong financials, combined with its AI integration and low debt levels, position it well for 2025's expected energy expansion. The company's technological leadership and global scale make it an attractive vehicle for investors looking to capitalize on potential U.S. energy policy shifts. As America moves toward more aggressive domestic production, SLB's comprehensive capabilities position it to play a crucial role in this transformation.

Title: Unannounced Warhammer RPG cancelled towards end of last year - report

As Games Workshop seeks next success. An unannounced Warhammer RPG was seemingly on the cards, however the project was cancelled towards the end of last year. A report by MP1st details posts by former employees of a developer known as Thought Pennies - a "role-playing game studio creating games focused on social storytelling" - who had an unannounced Warhammer game listed on their LinkedIn profiles. As with many other companies over the years, Thought Pennies has been affected by layoffs recently. Two months ago, Thought Pennies' CCO Daniel Erickson posted: "Over the last three years at Thought Pennies we built something amazing. We never missed a milestone, our feedback was great, our partnerships strong. We went from two people and a PowerPoint to a team of almost sixty heavily-vetted, incredibly independent, passionate professionals. Our publisher changed strategic direction, however, and our previous project is now without funding." This change meant Thought Pennies was required to "shrink the size of the studio". While Erickson did not specify what the developer was working on prior to his post, others who previously worked with the company listed an "unannounced Warhammer" project being made in Unreal Engine 5 on their own pages, with one stating a "fantasy live service RPG" had been cancelled. One post seen by MP1st described the game as a third person "Co-Op PvE Action RPG with a cast of unique heroes and playstyles", whcih would feature melee and ranged combat, as well as 'monstrous enemies set in a dark fantasy world'. Eurogamer has contacted Thought Pennies for further information on its recent projects, and the reported cancellation of a Warhammer RPG game. This week's report follows word earlier in the month that Games Workshop is looking to expand on the Warhammer series further, and is on the hunt for "the next one" following Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2's success last year. "We recognize that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income," Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree said last week. In addition, in December, Games Workshop and Amazon Studios officially finalised their plans to bring Warhammer 40K to film and TV screens.

Title: Factbox-Trump's inauguration marks new era for cryptocurrency

By Tom Wilson (Reuters) - Advocates and holders of crypto will soon influence U.S. policy on the emerging technology after a slew of nominations and advisory appointments by President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday. The crypto industry has spent years fighting lawsuits and enforcement actions by the U.S. government. It hopes the incoming Trump administration will mark a shift in policy. Political appointees will be vetted for potential conflicts. Some have committed to selling their interests. The industry is hosting a sold-out black tie ball in Washington on Friday, with tickets ranging from $2,500 to $10,000. David Sacks, Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, is scheduled to attend. Below are some facts on the crypto positions of key members of the incoming administration and Trump's inner circle. SCOTT BESSENT A billionaire hedge fund manager, Trump's pick to be Treasury Secretary has spoken favorably about crypto. "Crypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay," he told Fox News in July. "I think everything is on the table with bitcoin." According to a financial disclosure filed last month, Bessent holds shares in a BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) bitcoin exchange-traded fund worth between $250,001 and $500,000. Bessent will divest his interests in the fund and other investments within 90 days of his confirmation, he wrote last week to the U.S. Treasury. Bessent did not respond to a request for comment. HOWARD LUTNICK Trump's choice for Secretary of Commerce is a vocal supporter of bitcoin. Lutnick is CEO of New York brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, which earns fees to manage billions of dollars' worth of U.S. Treasuries for Tether, the company that issues the eponymous stablecoin. "Do I own bitcoin? Of course I do," Lutnick said at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. "Does Cantor Fitzgerald own bitcoin? A shedload of bitcoin." Lutnick did not respond to a request for comment. ELON MUSK The Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief and world's richest man, chosen by Trump to oversee a government cost-cutting effort, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has long championed crypto including bitcoin and dogecoin. His public comments and actions of his companies have in recent years influenced the price of bitcoin and dogecoin, a smaller token conceived as a joke during an earlier crypto bubble. The acronym for Musk's cost-cutting agency, DOGE, is a nod to dogecoin, which is now the world's seventh-biggest crypto token based on its circulation of $4.5 billion, according to data provider CoinGecko. In 2021 Tesla bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin, becoming one of the biggest companies to own crypto before selling most of its holdings. It held unspecified digital assets totaling $184 million in September 2024, a company financial report showed. Musk did not respond to a request for comment sent via Tesla on what crypto assets he may hold. VIVEK RAMASWAMY Set to work with Musk at DOGE, the former presidential candidate and entrepreneur is the founder of Strive Asset Management. Strive, which said in September it managed over $1 billion in assets, last month filed to launch an exchange-traded fund that invests in corporate bonds for bitcoin investments. The company's wealth management arm, launched in November, seeks to integrate bitcoin into Americans' investment portfolios, Ramaswamy said in a press release. In June 2023, Ramaswamy held $100,001 to $250,000 of bitcoin and $15,001 to $50,000 worth of the smaller token ether, according to a financial disclosure. He did not respond to a request for comment. DAVID SACKS A former PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) executive, Sacks was appointed White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar in December, tasked with developing a U.S. legal framework long sought by the crypto industry. Sacks is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures. The firm has invested in crypto firms including BitGo and Bitwise, its website shows. Sacks did not respond to requests for comment. STEVE WITKOFF Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate tycoon and donor to the incoming president, founded crypto venture World Liberty Financial in November. World Liberty, which sells a proprietary token, lists on its website Trump as among those entitled to a large share of any of the company's revenues. Witkoff did not respond to requests for comment. ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP JR., BARRON TRUMP Eric Trump told Reuters last year he was very involved in World Liberty, which he, his elder brother Don Jr. - seen as the most influential family member in the presidential transition - and younger half-brother Barron helped to form. Eric told a bitcoin conference in December the technology was a "financial revolution," and that his father would make the United States the crypto capital of the world. JD (NASDAQ:JD) VANCE U.S. Vice President-elect Vance held between $250,001 and $500,000 in bitcoin in August 2024, according to a financial disclosure. The venture capital firm co-founded by Vance, Narya, has made investments in Strive, Ramaswamy's asset management company, and video platform Rumble, its website shows. In November, Rumble said it would allocate its excess cash reserves to bitcoin. The company also received last year a $775 million investment from stablecoin firm Tether. Asked for comment on the crypto stances of Vance and Trump's sons, Trump-Vance transition spokesperson Brian Hughes said - without providing evidence - that bureaucrats in Washington had sought to stifle innovation with more regulation and higher taxes. "President Trump will deliver on his promise to encourage American leadership in crypto and other emerging technologies," he said in a statement to Reuters. PAUL ATKINS Atkins, a lawyer and former top SEC official, is Trump's choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission and has advocated for deregulation. He is expected to take a softer approach to crypto than current Chair Gary Gensler. Atkins is chief executive of Patomak Global Partners (NYSE:GLP), a consultancy. Patomak advises "cutting-edge crypto-native companies" and traditional financial firms on how to "leverage digital assets for growth," its website says. Atkins did not respond to a request for comment.

Title: Four Canadian Banks Quit Climate Group as Exodus Begun by Wall Street Picks Up

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal and National Bank of Canada said Friday that they’re no longer members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. All four added that they’re still committed to meeting climate-related targets. The departures raise further questions about NZBA’s future. Defections from the group began last month when Goldman Sachs Group Inc. left. The firm’s exit was followed by Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Investor Climate Group Suspends Activities After BlackRock Exit: Reuters Exclusive The moves coincide with intensifying Republican attacks on what US conservatives call “woke” capitalism and criticisms that such voluntary alliances haven’t had a meaningful impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Now, the defections are stretching to Canada. Banks that sign up to NZBA commit to transition their financed emissions to align with “pathways to net zero by 2050” at the latest, according to the group’s website. They’re also required to provide 2030 targets to show they’re on track, and to document their progress. NZBA sent a message to members earlier this week, saying it was focusing on its “next phase” to continue to help banks manage their climate-related risks and opportunities. The alliance, which was convened by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative almost four years ago, still has more than 135 members from over 40 countries, according to its website. BMO Chief Executive Officer Darryl White said at an industry conference last week that the bank supports the transition to a low-carbon economy regardless of the “mechanism.” He added that the company also has “a commitment, particularly here in Canada, to our legacy energy customers completely. We won’t abandon that.” In announcing its decision to leave NZBA, BMO said Friday that it has “robust internal capabilities to implement relevant international standards, supporting our climate strategy and meeting regulatory requirements.” Toronto-Dominion said in its statement that it has “the resources, relationships and capabilities to continue to advance our strategy, deliver for our shareholders, and advise our clients as they adapt their businesses and seize new opportunities.” Montreal-based National Bank, Canada’s sixth-largest lender, said it has decided to “streamline how we report on our plans and our progress.” CIBC said the company recognizes “the scale and urgency of climate change and our stated goals and commitments remain the same” Canadian banks were some of the biggest providers of finance to oil, gas and coal in 2024, with Toronto-Dominion, Royal Bank of Canada, BMO and CIBC ranking among the top 10 for such deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest provider of fossil-fuel finance last year was JPMorgan. Other climate alliances also have lost high-profile members. Just over a week into the new year, BlackRock Inc. said it was ending its membership in the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. The firm, which was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging antitrust breaches due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production, said staying inside NZBA had and exposed it to “legal inquiries.” In 2023, a net zero group for insurers saw a mass walkout amid GOP litigation threats. A similar group for investors, Climate Action 100+, was hit by high-profile defections last year as the asset management arms of Goldman and JPMorgan, as well as Pacific Investment Management Co. all left.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Box, Inc. (NYSE:BOX) stands against the other AI stocks. As President Joe Biden nears the end of his term, he is issuing a series of executive orders. In the latest, the President has signed an order to provide federal support to address the massive energy needs of fast-growing advanced artificial intelligence data centers. READ NOW: Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street’s Radar and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors’ Radar The order will allow federal land owned by the Defense and Energy departments to host gigawatt-scale AI data centers and new clean power facilities. According to Biden, the order will "accelerate the speed at which we build the next generation of AI infrastructure here in America, in a way that enhances economic competitiveness, national security, AI safety, and clean energy”. According to the order, companies tapping federal land for AI data centers must also purchase an "appropriate share" of American-made semiconductors. These purchases will be decided on a case-by-case basis. "It's really vital that we ensure that the AI industry can build out the infrastructure for training and using powerful AI models here in the United States”. Several known names, including OpenAI Senior Vice President of Global Affairs Chris Lehane, have commended this effort. Lehane also called out for cultivating a robust domestic infrastructure for the growing U.S. artificial intelligence sector. “So what you get with the Biden administration today is — at least from a signaling perspective — on federal land, trying to short the timeline between when you can get your project shovels in the ground and then the project going forward”. According to Lehane, the incoming Trump administration sees AI through two lenses — national security and economic security. He hopes that both sides of the coin will amalgamate into a national strategy. AI Company OpenAI has also recently laid out its vision for artificial intelligence development in the U.S. According to the company, the US needs investment from abroad and supportive regulation to stay ahead of China in the race for nascent technology. In a 15-page document called the “Economic Blueprint”, it said that "Chips, data, and energy are the keys to winning AI" and that the U.S. needs to act now to craft nationwide rules that can help secure its advantage. OpenAI released the document days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, with CEO Sam Altman also previously donating around $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund in hopes of fostering a positive relationship. "There's an estimated $175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects, and if the U.S. doesn't attract those funds, they will flow to China-backed projects —strengthening the Chinese Communist Party's global influence”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

In recent months, investors have taken a renewed interest in quantum computing. For this reason, most industry analysts believe quantum computing is years away from commercial viability. Fortunately, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has developed a quantum chip that is a possible game changer for the industry. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was founded in 1993, and it went on to create the world's first graphics processing units (GPUs) for computing, media, and gaming applications. Now, decades later, the company has adapted those powerful chips for data centers, where they are used to develop advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes data center operators will spend $1 trillion over the next four years on upgrading their infrastructure to meet demand from AI developers.

You can scoop up a share of Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC) for roughly $23 at its current price. What to know before you accept the loan. After reaching record highs last year, shares of Monolithic Power Systems have slumped more than 30% since the firm's last earnings report at the end of October, but analysts remain bullish on the stock. It would be reasonable to assume that none of these businesses have bargain stocks. Patient investors looking not only for growth, but for protection during market volatility, should take a closer look. With a market cap of about $990 billion, most investors are already very familiar with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Consider these pros and cons before starting a position in this leading cryptocurrency. Investors brace for a volatile ride as President-elect Donald Trump’s second term gets underway on Monday, bringing the promise of significant policy shifts.

The bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses could bring a cryptocurrency policy blitz in 2025 HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses could push states to become more open to crypto and lead public pension funds and treasuries to buy into it. Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to say government-backed currencies are prone to devaluation and increased government buy-ins will stabilize future price swings, giving them more legitimacy and boosting already rising prices. But the risks are significant. Critics say crypto investments are highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting future returns. They warn that investors should be prepared to lose money. Only a couple of public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency. A U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued late last year, warned it has “uniquely high volatility.” It found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto. 2024 was a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin surpassing $100,000. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. Now, crypto enthusiasts are banking on Trump's promise to make the United States the “bitcoin superpower” of the world. Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills this year to make them crypto-friendly. Analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby. Bitcoin miners are building new installations and venture capitalists are underwriting a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback. A bill introduced in November in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives sought to authorize the state's treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir. “I had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, ‘Oh my god, I’m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,' more than he ever did about any other bill,” said the measure's sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell. A bitcoin enthusiast who lost his reelection bid, Cabell expects a colleague to reintroduce his bill. Leaders of bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action say they expect legislation based on their model bill to be introduced in at least 10 other states this year. Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn’t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto. Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek. “There might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,” Brainard said. “But it’s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.” Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system allowing people to pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies. Fleming said he's not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather views it as a recognition that the government must innovate and be flexible about helping people do business with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state's, in crypto. “My concern is that at some point it’ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,” Fleming said. “And when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.” In Pennsylvania, Treasury Department officials said they have the authority to decide for themselves if cryptocurrencies meet the agency's investment standards under state law and don't need new legislation. Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency's need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said. Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin. That could change, said Mark Palmer, managing director and a senior research analyst at The Benchmark Company in New York. Pension boards got investment tools they like last year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. In October, it approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said. Many “are likely in the process of getting up to speed on what it means to invest in bitcoin and kicking the tires, so to speak, and that’s a process that typically takes a while at the institutional level,” Palmer said. Several major asset managers like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have bitcoin ETFs. In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became the first state to invest when it bought $160 million worth of shares in two ETFs, or about 0.1% of its assets. It later scaled back that investment to $104 million in one ETF, as of Sept. 30. A spokesperson declined to discuss it. Michigan's state investment board reported about $18 million in bitcoin ETF purchases, while a candidate for New Jersey governor, Steven Fulop, said that if elected he would push the state's pension fund to invest in crypto. Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been preparing for months to buy bitcoin ETF shares for up to 2% of the city's $250 million employee pension fund. “We were ahead of the curve," Fulop said. “And I think that’s what you’re eventually going to see is this is widely accepted, with regard to exposure in all pension funds, some sort of exposure.” ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “It is not unscientific to take a guess, although many people who are not in science believe that it is.” — Richard Feynman Number of the Week: 56 percent since 1990 THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This Week begins with a video and text of physicist Steve Koonin questioning the claim that we are experiencing a climate emergency. It then discusses the failure of science societies to defend the scientific method. Discussed is the hubris of government officials who fail to provide one of the tasks of government: public safety specifically in the Los Angeles Basin and potentially in New York City. Academic incompetence is compared with professional competence. This Week concludes with an issue on needing to know what type of salmon is being discussed. ************** A Climate Emergency? Ron Clutz provides a transcript of a short video by Steve Koonin, “Is There Really a Climate Emergency?” Koonin, a former Undersecretary for Science of the Department of Energy begins by discussing Hubris. Koonin states: “Hubris is a Greek word that means dangerously overconfident. Based on my research, hubris fairly describes our current response to the issue of climate change. Here’s what many people believe: One: The planet is warming catastrophically because of certain human behaviors. Two: Thanks to powerful computers we can project what the climate will be like 20, 40, or even 100 years from now. Three: That if we eliminate just one behavior, the burning of fossil fuels, we can prevent the climate from changing for as long as we like. Each of these presumptions—together, the basis of our hubris regarding the changing climate—is either untrue or so far off the mark as to be useless. Yes, it’s true that the globe is warming, and that humans are exerting a warming influence upon it. But beyond that, to paraphrase a line from the classic movie The Princess Bride, ‘I do not think ‘The Science’ says what you think it says.’” Koonin then presents physical evidence (data) showing that nothing unusual is taking place. As Richard Feynman stated: “It is not unscientific to take a guess, although many people who are not in science believe that it is.” For a scientist, the issue is to test the guess using physical evidence, preferably from controlled experiments, but if that is not possible, then by careful observations. The globe has warmed and cooled many times in the past as it is doing now. Koonin continues: “Why aren’t these reassuring facts better known? Because the public gets its climate information almost exclusively from the media. And from a media perspective, fear sells. ‘Things aren’t that bad’ doesn’t sell. Very few people, and that includes journalists who report on climate news, read the actual science. I have. And what the data—the hard science—from the US government and UN Climate reports say is that… ‘things aren’t that bad.’ Nor does the public understand the questionable basis of all catastrophic climate change projections: computer modeling. Projecting future climate is excruciatingly difficult. Yes, there are human influences, but the climate is complex. Anyone who says that climate models are ‘just physics’ either doesn’t understand them or is being deliberately misleading. I should know I wrote one of the first textbooks on computer modeling. While modelers base their assumptions upon both fundamental physical laws and observations of the climate, there is still considerable judgment involved. And since different modelers will make different assumptions, results vary widely among different models.” Koonin then shows that 73 models overestimate the warming of the globe. These models are the ones cited by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and its collaborators as proof of human caused global warming. One problem that Koonin discusses is the failure of the models to correctly forecast clouds. As Koonin states: “Natural fluctuations in the height and coverage of clouds have at least as much of an impact on the flows of sunlight and heat as do human influences. But how can we possibly know global cloud coverage say 10, let alone 50 years from now? Obviously, we can’t. But to create a climate model, we have to make assumptions. That’s a pretty shaky foundation on which to transform the world’s economy. By the way, creating more accurate models isn’t getting any easier. In fact, the more we learn about the climate system, the more we realize how complex it is. [Boldface added] Rather than admit this complexity, the media, the politicians, and a good portion of the climate science community attribute every terrible storm, every flood, every major fire to ‘climate change.’ Yes, we’ve always had these weather events in the past, the narrative goes, but somehow ‘climate change’ is making everything ‘worse.’ Even if that were true, isn’t the relevant question, how much worse? Not to mention that ‘worse’ is not exactly a scientific term. And how could we make it better? For the alarmists, that’s easy: we get rid of fossil fuels. Not only is this impractical—we get over 80% of the world’s energy from fossil fuels—it’s not scientifically possible. That’s because CO2 doesn’t disappear from the atmosphere in a few days like, say, smog. It hangs around for a really long time. About 60 percent of any CO2 that we emit today will remain in the atmosphere 20 years from now, between 30 and 55 percent will still be there after a century, and between 15 and 30 percent will remain after one thousand years.” To this, TWTW adds that the enormous growth in human CO2 emissions is coming from China and south Asia. The hubris of western politicians is amazing. Without even a hint of expertise in climate science, they pretend to “know” that CO2 is ruining the climate, fail to put “blame” on the biggest CO2 emitters, fail to acknowledge the benefits of increasing CO2, and enact laws to control their own citizenry under the guise of saving the planet. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. **************** Failure of Scientific Societies: In his paper presented in last week’s TWTW, Wallace Manheimer states (citations omitted here): “Scientific societies are supposed to be the guardians of the scientific method, rely principally on data to form their conclusions, and test scientific theories by comparing them to experiments and measurements. They do not seem to be acting in this role, as the paper will show. Instead, these scientific societies seem to have become the bedrock, the foundation, upon which the gigantic edifice of the oncoming climate crisis rests. This article, and many others make the case that this ‘edifice’ is a real threat to civilization. Take down the foundation, and the edifice will ultimately collapse. These scientific societies could do civilization an enormous favor. They could change their statements to ones that are more moderate and more scientifically correct. This could be an important first step to bringing the world back to sanity. They could give David his sling shot.” [Boldface added] Manheimer then cites sad examples of the hubris of the leadership of several such societies in rejecting requests to tone down their expressions on climate change for which they have negligible physical evidence. Yet, these societies do not permit dissent. Such societies include the American Physical Society, the American Meteorological Society, and the National Academy of Science. TWTW adds the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), publisher of the respected journal Science. Both Koonin and Manheimer bring up the loss of scientific standards, which infects politics and government policies at all levels. They result in the hubris that humans can predict and control climate and weather: things which humans cannot do. We do not have a database sufficient for forecasting a cold period, which is sure to come. Whether it is a D-O event, every roughly 1500 years, or a major glaciation, we do not know. But one is sure to come with great suffering. The great benefit of China and other countries adding CO2 to the atmosphere is that its beneficial effects in agriculture will lessen the harmful effects of a diminished growing season. Yet, organizations with diminished or no standards in using the scientific method continue to attack the benefits of carbon dioxide. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. **************** State and Local Government Hubris: The United States has multiple governments with defined geographical boundaries. A primary responsibility of state and local governments is maintaining public safety. As with the federal government, state and local governments have competing purposes or goals. Unfortunately, in many state and local governments the convergence of competing goals has overwhelmed the primary responsibility of maintaining public safety. We are seeing the lack of maintaining public safety in the fires occurring in the Los Angeles Basin. There is a great deal of political finger pointing, in personal efforts to avoid responsibility on many levels, from governor, to mayor, to department heads. Perhaps long-time political commentator and California native Victor Davis Hanson expresses it best in a video on January 13. He begins: “We’re into about the fourth or fifth day of the Los Angeles fires, and people are commenting on the complete systems breakdown. It’s a word that sociologists, historians, and archaeologists use— ‘systems breakdown’—but also ‘systems collapse,’ the collapse of complex societies; for example, the Mycenaeans and others. But it’s the idea that the system becomes so complex that very few people operate it. And when those people are incompetent, and they tend to be bureaucratic and ossified, calcified, then the entire system is so dependent upon them, it collapses. That’s what we’re seeing in Los Angeles. It is a multifaceted breakdown. The insurance industry is overregulated. It [the public] doesn’t trust the state to police, give the people security in their homes. It doesn’t trust their ability to stop fires. They understand there’s no water policy that’s logical in the state. And they want out. … It’s a fire problem. We have lost the ability to fight fires that our grandfathers, over decades, practiced and honed to a fine art. We have lost control, as I said, of the water. The water issue is a disaster. We have plenty of water. We had a brilliant California water project, Central Valley project, and we abused it and have not built a reservoir in nearly 40 years outside of Los Angeles. It is also a regulatory problem that we overregulate so we do not allow people to expand their homes, fix their homes, improve their homes, build their homes. And finally, it’s a ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ [problem]. This is what I want to get to, because … that’s the most controversial. … I think we should look at this in a historical perspective. Anytime an ideology trumps empiricism, meritocracy, investigatory efforts, just disinterested inquiry, and knowledge, then you’re going to have a disaster.” Hanson gives examples of breakdowns caused by ideology in the WW II Russian and German military, then continues with: “But in our case, when you take a person’s superficial appearance—in the case of race—or their beliefs that are ideological, whether it’s religious, or it’s an emphasis on one’s sexual orientation, or whether it’s an interest, on one’s gender, male, female, etc., and you put that over empirical investigation, then you’re not going to be able to, in a scientific matter, solve a problem. And so, when we looked at these people, we have a $700,000 a year utilities czar in Los Angeles, and she cannot explain why there was not enough water, at least in a convincing way, because she’s never had to, because she was ideologically correct. You have an assistant fire chief who said, if women can’t—if I can’t carry out a man [out of a burning building], then that’s not on me. It’s the man shouldn’t be there. It’s like saying if a child fell down a well, and I’m not physically strong enough to retrieve him and save him, that’s his fault. He shouldn’t have been in the well. Why does a person say that? Because she knows that she was appointed to that position on other criteria. The same thing holds true, no need to get into the mayor, who people voted [for] as a DEI candidate. She said at one point, a few years ago, ‘Don’t blame the homeless for these fires.’ So, we get—in conclusion in the Los Angeles catastrophe, there are whole areas of empirical inquiry that are put off- limits. You cannot talk about the homeless and whether there was a homeless person who was out in the hills, to get warm light a fire. It’s a legitimate topic of inquiry. It’s happened. You can’t talk about— [Los Angeles Mayor] Karen Bass, as I said, ‘Don’t talk about that,’ in the past. You cannot talk about the fire department because it is run by people who were appointed primarily because of the DEI criteria and to do so makes you a homophobe. You cannot talk about fires and the lack of forest safety, forest ecology, because to do so challenges the green ideology. I could go on. But until the society says that we are going to have free speech, no topic is taboo, and we can find the answer to questions by symptomology—we look at all of the evidence, and then we make a diagnosis. … And then we make a prognosis. Until we can do that without the influence or the tyranny of these ideologies—in our case, our generation, it’s ‘diversity, equity, inclusion,’ and radical environmentalism that preclude free discussion and the pathway to the truth, we’re going to have more Los Angeloses, I’m afraid to say. …” [Boldface added] See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy, links under Suppressing Scientific Inquiry, links under Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science for arguments that AAAS should become more political and links under California Fire for many examples of government officials shirking the primary responsibility maintaining public safety. For an essay on the insurance problems see Article #1 **************** Academics v. Professionals: Thus far, possibly the most irresponsible response from academics came from UCLA which linked two wet raining seasons and about 10 months of drying on manmade “climate change.” The claim has a tiny element of truth, carbon dioxide is enhancing vegetation growth, but it is surrounded by bodyguard of lies. Separately ecologist Jim Steele and meteorologist Cliff Mass penetrate through the false claims. In “Assigning Responsibility for the Tragic Los Angeles Fires” Steele writes: “Knowing that natural, lethal fire dangers are always looming for the growing population, the question is whether city and state governments could have been better prepared to minimize ignitions and more efficiently contain a fire’s spread through southern California. When fires reach neighborhoods with densely packed houses, one burning structure can radiate enough heat to ignite adjacent buildings causing entire neighborhoods to burn to the ground. An increase in the destruction of property by wildfires better correlates with population growth and the expansion of an electrical grid that is vulnerable to high winds. Increased 1-hour fuels and 10-hour fuels due to land disturbances and poor land management correlate with bigger fires. Increased homeless populations correlates with more ignitions.” [Boldface added] In “Why the LA Wildfires Have Little to do With Long-Term Drought or Climate Change” Mass writes: “Most of these fuels are 1-10 hr. fuels, which means they typically dry out after 1-10 hours of drying conditions. The meteorological conditions immediately preceding the fires were so drying (very strong winds with very low humidities) that even if it had rained the week before, the fire still would have occurred.” It takes one to ten hours for Santa Ana winds to dry out the southern California landscape, not a season or a major drought. Perhaps densely packed neighborhoods should require hard landscaping such as crushed rock; fire resistant roofs, such as steel or tile; and non-combustible decks, fire-resistant decks are required in fire prone areas. See links under California Fires. **************** The Other California Fire: Initially, the mainstream media ignored another significant California fire. This one at what was the world’s largest battery storage system (BESS) which is located at Moss Landing, Monterey Bay, California. The fire was significant not because it caused deaths (none), or extensive property damage (none outside the facility) but because it triggered major evacuation orders. Lithium fires release real toxins such as hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen cyanide in addition to the EPA pseudo-pollutant carbon dioxide. The best fire control strategy is to evacuate the area and let it burn. Reports are spotty, but it appears that about 7500 acres were evacuated and about 1200 to 1500 people. This is the third or fourth such fire at the facility. The acreage and number of people involved are trivial compared to the Los Angeles basin fires. But as Francis Menton discusses, lithium battery storage is being planned to replace natural gas peaking plants in all five boroughs in New York City. The first one is to begin construction this spring in Queens Borough, across the East River from mid-town Manhattan. A major evacuation order would cause chaos. If the project continues, it will be another example of public official hubris. See links under Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Energy – Storage. **************** What Type of Salmon? Hydraulic Dam opponents are claiming that the dams on the west coast are destroying the salmon fisheries. Already, California politicians are bragging about the removal of dams along the Klamath River, with little concern for the agricultural communities hurt by such actions. Efforts are being made to remove dams along the Columbia River, particularly on its tributary the Snake River which flows from Wyoming through Idaho. Oregon, and Washington before joining the Columbia River. The purpose of the dam removal is to restore the spectacular runs of Chinook Salmon to these areas. But will it? TWTW reader Ken Snider draws attention to a skeptical post by Craig Medred, who cites a report by Idaho fish specialists for the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission, which questions the assumption that dams are a major cause of the declining runs of Chinook salmon. One issue for the decline is the return of marine mammals which gorge themselves on salmon, particularly at the mouth of the Columbia River. These mammals include seals and killer whales. TWTW reader Ken Snider draws attention to a skeptical post by Craig Medred, who cites a report by Idaho fish specialists for the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission, which questions the assumption that dams are a major cause of the declining runs of Chinook salmon. Another issue is manmade. Fish hatcheries have shifted in the types of salmon they produce. They now emphasize pink salmon, which do not travel long distances up rivers, typically less than 40 miles, with exceptions. The huge expansion in hatcheries and the shift in fish they produce may significantly increase competition for food sources to the detriment of Chinook salmon. According the Alaska Department of Fish and Game: “Alaska hatchery salmon releases grew from less than 100 million young fish in 1980 to about 2 billion per year today. Alaska’s release of close to 1.5 billion salmon fry in 2000 accounted for 69 percent of the coastwide, North American release of salmon, ISER [Institute of Social and Economic Research] reported, with about 94 percent of those salmon pinks and chum of significantly lower value than Chinook, coho and sockeye salmon but far and away the cheapest fish to produce. Alaska would continue to boost pink and chum hatchery releases in the years that followed, as would Russia after witnessing Alaska’s hatchery success, and by the late 2010s, scientists were reporting that there were more salmon in the North Pacific than at any time in human history with the pinks, the smallest and least valuable of the species, dominant.” [Boldface added] The hydroelectric dams in the Pacific Northwest greatly added to the prosperity of the Pacific Northwest. Destroying these dams “to save salmon” may be destruction for no purpose but political hubris. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. **************** Number of the Week: 56 percent since 1990. Using the “Cumulative CO₂ emissions” data from Our World in Data, Jo Nova estimates that 56% of cumulative CO2 occurred since 1990. Though she does not say this, 1990 was the year the UN IPCC released its First Assessment Report, which was drastically changed in its 1992 Assessments and subsequent reports blaming human emissions of CO2 for climate change. One could argue that the more the UN IPCC and its collaborators rail against carbon dioxide with false claims of climate change, the more humans release carbon dioxide.

Censorship Australian Labour Party Disinformation Portal “Swamped” With Party’s Own Misleading Ads By Rebekah Barnet, Aug 30, 2025 Climate misinformation is rife on social media – and poised to get worse By Jill Hopke, The Conversation, Jan 17, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] In 2020, Meta rolled out its Climate Science Information Center on Facebook to respond to climate misinformation.

The piece provides some history, which I will spare you, of how the “ultraprocessed foods” characterization got started and developed. A fair summary is that it is a part of the overall UN effort to smear the West and the productive countries and companies of the world.

This is very strong, some would say compelling, evidence that wind development is causing whale deaths. Correlation is not causation but correlation in the context of a causal hypothesis is strong evidence. (This is the basis for clinical trials.)

Demand for natural gas will still remain high in winter for many years to come – we still need it to heat our homes and generate electricity in weeks like this one.

By John Carr, Net Zero Watch, Jan 16, 2025 The difference in fuel means the radioactive waste from fusion has a shorter lifetime than that from fission and so simplifies long-term waste handling. Unfortunately, fusion reactions are more difficult to initiate and contain than fission, meaning the power stations must be much more complex and expensive. While fission has produced electricity on world-wide grids for 70 years, fusion has been in a research and development phase during the same period. There are currently about 90 operational fusion devices in 50 different countries around the world, of which 3 are in the UK. Forty more are under development. Among the operational projects, there are more than a dozen different technologies used, including 51 tokamaks, 9 stellarators and 8 laser fusion devices.

A Tale of Two State Insurance Markets Florida fixed its market with reforms. California didn’t. See the results. By The Editorial Board, WSJ, Jan. 16, 2025 TWTW summary. After the California fires, many homeowners and politicians will blame insurance companies for lack of payment. But many problems occur from state insurance regulations. The editorial begins with: “Hard to believe, but the Los Angeles wildfires have Republicans in Congress talking about federalizing home insurance. Why should all Americans be on the hook for insurance liabilities of states like California that have mismanaged their markets?” The editorial discusses a specific example than continues with: “The 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act enshrines state regulatory authority over insurance. This system has worked relatively well over 80 years. But some states have done a better job of managing their markets than others. California and Florida provide an illustrative contrast. Democratic insurance commissioners in the Golden State have for years suppressed rates. Until recently, California was the only state that prohibited carriers from using catastrophe models to project disaster risk and pricing reinsurance costs into their premiums. Wildfires—exacerbated by the state’s poor land mismanagement—have swelled insurer claims and liabilities. Insurers are paying out $1.09 in expenses and claims for every $1 they collect in premiums. They’ve curbed their exposure in part by dropping policy holders in high-risk areas and leaving the market. The liabilities of the state’s insurer of last resort, FAIR, have exploded to $458 billion from $153 billion in 2020, with $5.9 billion in exposure in the Pacific Palisades. Yet Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara rejected FAIR’s proposed rate increases while requiring it to cover homes worth up to $3 million. FAIR President Victoria Roach told the state Assembly last year that the insurer in 2021 requested a 48.8% rate increase—less than the 70% it needed—but was approved for 15.7%. FAIR is under-capitalized and had only $700 million in cash on hand as of last year to pay claims. To prevent more insurers from leaving the state, Mr. Lara last month finally let carriers to price in their reinsurance costs and use catastrophe models. But he also capped the reinsurance costs that carriers can pass along. Rates are set to rise 20% to 40% this year, though this still may not be enough to cover insurer liabilities. Unable to raise rates, many insurers have increased deductibles and capped maximum payments. That means insurers might not cover all of the fire damage, and some homeowners will face hefty rebuilding costs. Lucky for them the Federal Emergency Management Agency covers losses if homeowners are ‘under-insured.’ This means taxpayers in Houston and Little Rock may pay for rebuilding multi-million-dollar homes in California. If FAIR becomes insolvent, all insurers in California—meaning their customers—are on the hook for its claims. Homeowners could see rates rise by thousands of dollars a year. In Florida, in striking contrast, Republicans headed off an insurance market death spiral caused by litigation abuse. State law had allowed policy holders to assign their claim benefits to contractors working with trial lawyers. Contractors would inflate charges and then sue insurers if they rejected them, setting up a costly claim-by-claim battle. Insurers lost hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and more than a dozen failed between 2020 and 2022. Others left the market because litigation costs made it difficult to obtain reinsurance. Florida’s insurer of last resort, Citizens Property Insurance Corp., became the state’s biggest carrier and was in danger of collapsing. Enter Gov. Ron DeSantis, who championed tort reforms in 2022 and 2023 that have stanched the flood of frivolous lawsuits, stabilized the market and reduced Citizens’ exposure. According to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, nine insurers have since entered the market. Sixty percent of Florida’s top 10 carriers have expanded their business in the state, and 40% have filed for rate decreases. The average monthly request for rate increases is now 1.2%, compared to 14% a few years ago. If not for Mr. DeSantis’s reforms, last year’s hurricanes might have toppled Citizens. Federalizing the U.S. insurance market would create a moral hazard and discourage state reforms. Rather than protecting California’s Democrats from the costs of their blunders, Republicans should point to Florida.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

Not so long ago, Mark Zuckerberg [seemed to want] the public to view him not just as an empire builder, but also as a world-saver. Meta Platforms’ CEO publicly committed parts of his vast fortune to causes like immigration reform and voter access. He spoke out about combating poverty and hunger and stressed the importance of equality. In a flurry of announcements, Zuckerberg confirmed a change of heart. Now, he [appears to have] whittled his ambitions. Getting rid of fact checkers and loosening the rules on what users can say on Meta’s platforms [will likely] heighten misinformation and abusive speech. He also ended Meta’s commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Also Read: Zuckerberg’s Meta shift will leave the user base of his platforms splitThis may be an extreme case, but across America Inc, the trend is pointing in the same direction: CEOs are spending much less time, energy and money trying to publicly position themselves as change agents. In Silicon Valley, the make-the-world-a-better-place discourse of the early boom years has mostly disappeared. On Wall Street, big institutions from JPMorgan Chase to Goldman Sachs and BlackRock have abandoned one of the world’s biggest finance groups dedicated to battling climate change. Companies that put out statements about racial justice after the murder of George Floyd have rolled back DEI investments. Some of the CEOs who stood up to Donald Trump’s Muslim-majority country travel ban and condemned the 6 January riots have made $1 million donations to his inauguration fund. You could argue that many of those initiatives were just corporate virtue signalling. But what’s clear is companies don’t feel much of a need to virtue signal anymore. And no wonder: The public isn’t all that interested in virtue right now, and business seems to be having a hard time convincing Americans that it ever had much of it. CEOs’ attempts to portray themselves as do-gooders have typically been a business posture rather than a moral one. Starting a foundation or throwing a smidgen of a company’s resources behind a popular cause has historically been a useful tool to repair corporate reputations in the aftermath of scandals and catastrophes. Starbucks, for example, instituted a policy in 2018 that let anyone, not just paying customers, hang out in its stores or use its bathrooms. This was instituted after the company was accused of racial bias and faced boycotts when two [African American] men were arrested in a Philadelphia store. “We are committed to creating a culture of warmth and belonging where everyone is welcome," the company said. This week, Starbucks said it would end the practice in order to help reinvigorate the brand. Its management does not seem too worried about blowback or being labelled a flip-flopper. Plenty of these corporate reversals are a straightforward response to political winds blowing towards the right and President-elect Donald Trump. Zuckerberg admitted as much in his announcement, justifying his decision by saying “the recent election also feels like a cultural tipping point." The company has the same calculus as many others: It would rather be called a hypocrite by those on the left than become a target of the right for ‘woke’ policies. But it’s also apparent to America Inc’s CEOs that not only has the “#resistance" that pressured them to stand up to Trump’s line-crossing in his first term gone mute, but some business leaders are being cheered for flouting traditional expectations of decorum. Case in point: the language used by Elon Musk, who has only seen his wealth and power grow. Also Read: Welcome Elon Musk, the shadow president-elect of the United StatesNow Zuckerberg seems to be following a similar playbook. His burst of activity last week included announcing new Meta board member Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, a Trump loyalist who two years ago was captured on video slapping his wife; telling Joe Rogan that companies need more “masculine energy," overseeing the announcement that Meta would end its DEI efforts; and saying that it would get rid of fact checkers on its platforms—a change he acknowledged would mean they would “catch less bad stuff." The Intercept published excerpts of the new internal training materials, which said allowed speech would now include examples like “immigrants are grubby, filthy pieces of bleep" and “gays are freaks." Will Zuckerberg’s company also find itself rewarded? Users and advertisers may be grumbling, but so far there has been no mass exodus from his platforms. If Meta’s big pivot succeeds, we can expect to see more CEOs exploring [dark spaces]. And why not? If the US public does not expect more of business leaders, why bother to keep such temptations in check? ©Bloomberg Also Read: Mint Quick Edit | Meta’s morphosis: Good news or bad?

CEOs’ attempts to portray themselves as do-gooders have typically been a business posture rather than a moral one. Starting a foundation or throwing a smidgen of a company’s resources behind a popular cause has historically been a useful tool to repair corporate reputations in the aftermath of scandals and catastrophes. Starbucks, for example, instituted a policy in 2018 that let anyone, not just paying customers, hang out in its stores or use its bathrooms. This was instituted after the company was accused of racial bias and faced boycotts when two [African American] men were arrested in a Philadelphia store. “We are committed to creating a culture of warmth and belonging where everyone is welcome," the company said. This week, Starbucks said it would end the practice in order to help reinvigorate the brand. Its management does not seem too worried about blowback or being labelled a flip-flopper. Plenty of these corporate reversals are a straightforward response to political winds blowing towards the right and President-elect Donald Trump. Zuckerberg admitted as much in his announcement, justifying his decision by saying “the recent election also feels like a cultural tipping point." The company has the same calculus as many others: It would rather be called a hypocrite by those on the left than become a target of the right for ‘woke’ policies. But it’s also apparent to America Inc’s CEOs that not only has the “#resistance" that pressured them to stand up to Trump’s line-crossing in his first term gone mute, but some business leaders are being cheered for flouting traditional expectations of decorum. Case in point: the language used by Elon Musk, who has only seen his wealth and power grow. Also Read: Welcome Elon Musk, the shadow president-elect of the United StatesNow Zuckerberg seems to be following a similar playbook. His burst of activity last week included announcing new Meta board member Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, a Trump loyalist who two years ago was captured on video slapping his wife; telling Joe Rogan that companies need more “masculine energy," overseeing the announcement that Meta would end its DEI efforts; and saying that it would get rid of fact checkers on its platforms—a change he acknowledged would mean they would “catch less bad stuff." The Intercept published excerpts of the new internal training materials, which said allowed speech would now include examples like “immigrants are grubby, filthy pieces of bleep" and “gays are freaks." Will Zuckerberg’s company also find itself rewarded? Users and advertisers may be grumbling, but so far there has been no mass exodus from his platforms. If Meta’s big pivot succeeds, we can expect to see more CEOs exploring [dark spaces]. And why not? If the US public does not expect more of business leaders, why bother to keep such temptations in check? ©Bloomberg Also Read: Mint Quick Edit | Meta’s morphosis: Good news or bad?

Title: TikTok Restores Service After US Ban, Thanks Incoming President Donald Trump

Photo Credit: Reuters Not everyone in Trump's Republican Party agreed with efforts to get around the law and "Save TikTok" TikTok began restoring its services on Sunday after President-elect Donald Trump said he would revive the app's access in the US when he returns to power on Monday. "Frankly, we have no choice. We have to save it," Trump said at a rally on Sunday ahead of his inauguration, adding that the US will seek a joint venture to restore the short-video sharing app used by 170 million Americans. In a message to users hours before the rally, TikTok said: "As a result of president Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the US" TikTok also issued an earlier statement after US users reported being able to access the Chinese-owned service's website while the far more widely used TikTok app itself began coming back online for some users with just a few basic services. As of Sunday evening, the app remained unavailable for download on US app stores. "In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service," TikTok said in the earlier statement that also thanked Trump for "providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties (for) providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over seven million small businesses to thrive." TikTok's public thanks to Trump, the day before he takes office, comes at a tense moment in US-China relations. Trump has said he intends to place tariffs on China but has also indicated he hopes to have more direct contact with China's leader. The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said. TikTok stopped working for US. users late on Saturday before a law shutting it down on national security grounds took effect on Sunday. US officials had warned that under Chinese parent company ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused. Trump said he would "extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security." "I would like the United States to have a 50 percent ownership position in a joint venture," he wrote on Truth Social. Trump said the executive order would specify there would be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before his order. Trump had earlier said he would most likely give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned," a message notified users of TikTok, which disappeared from Apple and Google app stores late on Saturday. Trump saving TikTok represents a reversal in stance from his first term in office. In 2020, he aimed to ban the app over concerns the company was sharing Americans' personal info with the Chinese government. More recently, Trump has said he has "a warm spot in my heart for TikTok," crediting the app with helping him win over young voters in the 2024 election. In August 2020, Trump signed an executive order giving ByteDance 90 days to sell TikTok but then blessed a deal structured as a partnership rather than a divestment that would have included both Oracle and Walmart taking stakes in the new company. Not everyone in Trump's Republican Party agreed with efforts to get around the law and "Save TikTok". Republican senators Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said in a joint statement: "Now that the law has taken effect, there is no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date. For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law's qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China." The US has never banned a major social media platform. The law passed overwhelmingly by Congress gives the incoming Trump administration sweeping authority to ban or seek the sale of other Chinese-owned apps. Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app CapCut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday. Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 'Hair on Fire' Moment Web searches for "VPN" spiked in the minutes after US users lost access to TikTok, according to Google Trends. Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform's e-commerce arm. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans in what one executive described as a "hair on fire" moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialize to keep the app running. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the US presidential inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told Reuters. Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has also held talks about selling TikTok's US operations to billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that. US search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok US, a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok US and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60 percent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 percent each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the US. © Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Title: Stock market today: Asian shares gain and bitcoin hits a record high ahead of U.S. inauguration

WSB Now BANGKOK — (AP) — Asian shares advanced early Monday and bitcoin surged to a record high ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for a holiday. The price of bitcoin surged as high as $109,134 early Monday, up from $99,563, according to CoinDesk. Cryptocurrencies have gained substantially since Trump was elected, as investors wagered on his favor for such assets. European benchmarks gained in early trading, with Britain's FTSE 100 edging 0.1% higher to 8,515.80, while the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.2% at 7,729.06. Germany's DAX was nearly unchanged at 20,902.00. The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.1%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 1.8% to 19,925.81 after China’s central bank kept its key lending rates unchanged. The Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% higher to 3,244.38. A Hong Kong court extended a deadline for troubled property developer Country Garden to reach an agreement with its creditors until next month in the latest slow step toward recovery from a prolonged downturn in China's real estate sector. Sentiment also was helped by upbeat comments by U.S. and Chinese officials ahead of Trump's inauguration later Monday. Pledges by both sides to work to improve relations may have alleviated some concerns over trade tensions that have built up as businesses brace for a possible increase in tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index climbed 1.2% to 38,902.50. The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen, trading at 156.17 yen, down from 156.31 yen. Expectations are building that Japan's central bank might raise its key interest rate in a monetary policy meeting later this week. Higher rates tend to boost the value of the yen versus the dollar. The euro rose to $1.0309 from $1.0281. In South Korea, the Kospi slipped 0.1% to 2,520.05. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.5% to 8,347.40. Taiwan's Taiex picked up 0.5% and India's Sensex surged 0.7%. Bangkok's SET gained 0.1%. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil shed 19 cents to $77.20 per barrel and Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 23 cents to $80.56 per barrel. On Friday, the S&P 500 climbed 1% and the Dow rose 0.8%. The Nasdaq composite rallied 1.5%. SLB helped lead the market after the provider oilfield services delivered bigger profit and revenues for the end of 2024 than analysts expected. It jumped 6.1% after it also raised its dividend by 3.6% and said it’s returning $2.3 billion to its investors by buying back its own stock. All the Big Tech companies in what's come to be known as the " Magnificent Seven " rose: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. Because they're so massive in size, their movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes than other stocks. Such shares have been under pressure recently because of criticism their prices may have shot too high after leading the market for so many years. Such worries grew after Treasury yields jumped in the bond market. Higher yields hurt prices for all kinds of investments, particularly those seen as the most expensive. But stocks broadly got a lift this week from an encouraging report on U.S. inflation, which raised hopes that the Federal Reserve may deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. More such cuts, which began in September, would ease the brakes off the economy and boost prices for investments, though they can also give inflation more fuel. Wall Street has been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports pushed traders to revamp their expectations about what the Fed will do with rates. Lower worries about inflation have sent Treasury yields down and stocks up, while worsening worries about inflation have triggered the opposite reaction. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Title: Pancreatic cancer: ‘I just can’t explain what it felt like hearing those words’

Often dubbed “the silent killer”, pancreatic cancer has one of the least successful outcomes of all types of the disease. With roughly 600 cases diagnosed in Ireland each year, it is not as common as other forms of cancer. But while incidence rates may be at the lower end of the scale – the rate of skin cancer is roughly 13,000 annually – it has a poor survival rate, with five out of six people with pancreatic cancer dying from the disease. However, although the signs can be very difficult to spot, as in the early stages they can be similar to other less serious conditions, the sooner the patient is diagnosed the better chances they have of survival. Susan McSweeney can attest to this as she was diagnosed with the disease in early 2024. Thankfully, she was very vigilant about her health and went to see her GP as soon as she began to feel unwell. “I went to my doctor with a cough, which was initially diagnosed as reflux,” she says. “But when my GP felt around my back she thought that it seemed tender around the lower left area,” says Susan. “Because I am quite fit and went to the gym three times a week, and also love walking and mountain biking, I had brushed it [the tenderness] off as muscle strain, but my doctor said it might be a good idea to get a ultrasound as there would be ‘no harm’ in doing one. “There is a clinic in Blackrock village [in Dublin] where you can have a walk-in ultrasound, so, although I had a referral, I didn’t need it to go there – so I went off and had it done and the results showed up a blockage in my pancreatic duct. After that, the doctor referred me to a gastroenterologist – even though she thought I was in good health because I was not jaundiced. But although she seemed in no rush to push things forward, I decided to change to St Vincent’s hospital [with the initial referral] where there was definitely a much greater sense of urgency.” Although the now 54-year-old, who lives in Dublin with her husband James and two grown-up sons, was sent for further tests, the results were a complete shock. “I underwent an endoscopic ultrasound and was told that a biopsy was to be taken, but afterwards they said that no biopsy was retrieved. I received a call a few days after the scan to say that an MRI that I was booked in for was being brought forward. “Hearing this set off alarm bells and then, when we met my consultant, I was told that I had a tumour. James and I were completely shell-shocked – I just can’t explain what it felt like hearing those words. Apparently, the biopsy could not be taken because the tumour – which was a PT1C N0 grade – was too near the gastroduodenal artery. They mentioned the word ‘Whipple’, which was almost too much to take in at the time, but I was told that I had been booked in for Whipple surgery – which involves removing the affected part of pancreas, bile duct, duodenum and part of the stomach – on April 19th, 2024. “I had no doubt that it would be a very tough surgery and afterwards I was in hospital for three weeks because my stomach was not emptying. I was fed by TPN [total parenteral nutrition] for the whole time, which meant that I could not have any water or food by mouth – and I would say that, without a doubt, that was the toughest part. “Then, about six weeks after the operation, I saw my oncologist and was told that I would be given six months [12 rounds] of Folfirinox – and I started chemotherapy on July 3rd. It involved one day each week in hospital getting chemotherapy through a port [on a Wednesday], then bringing the chemo home with me in a pump for 46 hours and going back to St Vincent’s hospital on a Friday afternoon to be disconnected. “The first few months were not too bad and I was still swimming and walking and only felt sick for a couple of days after having my chemo. But that all changed from September when the cumulative effect of the treatment started to kick in. I know that everybody is different, but it is a very rough regime.” The mother of two, who runs a family law firm in Dublin, underwent her last session of chemotherapy in December and says she is doing well and is positive about her recovery. She is grateful for all the support she received during her gruelling ordeal and says she is so fortunate to be here today and would encourage everyone, including GPs, to know the vital signs which could save someone’s life. “The care that I have received from St Vincent’s oncology has been amazing. In spite of all the hardship involved in going on in the ward, everyone seems upbeat and that is down to the phenomenal nursing staff who have been there with me every step of the way. I have had two admissions to A&E throughout my treatment, for viruses, but never felt nervous or afraid, as I have been so well looked after. So, I would advise anyone who is going through something similar to hand over control to those in the know and don’t Google too much. “As for my family and friends, they have all been just fantastic and so supportive – from phone calls to dropping in dinners – because this treatment does not just affect me, it also affects my family too. “Thankfully, I was very lucky with my GP, but I would like for all GPs to be aware of the symptoms of pancreatic cancer and to know that jaundice is not the only sign. For me, the signs that I had pancreatic cancer were pain in lower left back, a cough that would not go away and light-coloured, floating stools. Also, as well as making people aware of what to look out for, I would like to get out there that St Vincent’s hospital is the centre of excellence for all things pancreatic. This would save time with regard to consultant referrals. “My advice to others is that if something does not feel quite right, always go to your GP and get it checked out. Something as simple as an ultrasound could save your life, like it did mine. Although I do not yet know what the future holds until I get the full low down at my next appointment, I am determined to raise awareness and raise up the success stories.” Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide – because so many cases are at an advanced stage when diagnosed, 50 per cent die within the first year. Some of the early signs of pancreatic cancer are similar to other health conditions and Prof Grainne O’Kane, consultant oncologist specialising in pancreatic cancer malignancies, said the disease is so lethal that clinical trials should be considered part of the first line of treatment. “Early intervention is critical and aligned to clinical trials will lead to better outcomes,” she says. “People should be aware of the link between the six leading symptoms and pancreatic cancer, particularly if there is a family history of the disease. “Depending on the stage of the cancer at diagnosis, the treatment for pancreatic cancer includes surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy but over 80 per cent of people are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery [Whipple] because symptoms do not develop until the advanced stage of the disease.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Is Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve A Threat To Freedom?

ATLANTA, GEORGIA - JUNE 27: Republican presidential candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump ... [+] participates in the CNN Presidential Debate at the CNN Studios on June 27, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia. Former President Trump and U.S. President Joe Biden are facing off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 campaign. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Donald Trump assumes office with plans to make the United States the world's bitcoin mining capital. Many are celebrating the idea of bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset. Supporters like Michael Saylor, Tether, and other large institutional players argue this is a landmark achievement, reinforcing bitcoin's status as a legitimate store of value. However, this growing institutionalization risks compromising bitcoin's original ethos as "freedom money," with its decentralization and censorship resistance eroding under the weight of regulatory and economic control. Truth Social Trump's administration has made bitcoin mining a national priority, framing it as an opportunity to dominate the "block space". Rachel Silverstein, U.S. General Counsel for Bitfarms, commented on the day of the election that, "Sanctions in my mind are a way to avoid war," and continued to say leaving sanctions as a tool for states to use is important. Bitcoin blocks have a finite capacity, limiting the number of transactions that can be included in each block. Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, commented in an X post: "Block space ensures the ability to transact. Let's keep the US as the most dominant Bitcoin mining country in the world." This dominance could empower the U.S. to enforce transaction censorship via compliance with Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions or other regulatory tools. The precedent for such control already exists. In 2021, Marathon attempted to mine "OFAC-compliant" blocks, filtering transactions from sanctioned entities. More recently, mining pools like F2Pool have been flagged for possibly excluding sanctioned transactions. Trump's push for mining dominance presents a clear path to institutionalizing these practices, leveraging tools like the Bank Secrecy Act and FATF recommendations that promote widespread KYC and classify wallet software as Crypto Asset Service Providers. U.S. regulations often set the tone for the international community, particularly in financial systems. For example, the FATF's global anti-money laundering standards reflect U.S. priorities, and its recommendations have influenced crypto regulations worldwide. Trump's administration could use bitcoin mining dominance to propagate a framework that aligns with U.S. geopolitical goals. Former White House cybersecurity advisor Carol House suggested in a 2023 talk that network-level censorship could serve national interests, demonstrating the potential to regulate bitcoin under the guise of national security. The United States has a history of extending its financial jurisdiction beyond its borders to combat illicit activities. For instance, in January 2023, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network identified Bitzlato Limited, a Hong Kong-registered cryptocurrency exchange, as a "primary money laundering concern" due to its connections with Russian illicit finance. This designation led to prohibitions on certain fund transmittals involving Bitzlato by any covered financial institution, effectively restricting its operations on a global scale. In March 2023, U.S. and German authorities shut down ChipMixer, a cryptocurrency service that allegedly laundered over $3 billion in crypto assets since 2017. ChipMixer was reportedly used by ransomware groups, suspected North Korean hackers, and darknet market users to conceal the origins of illicit funds. These actions demonstrate how the U.S.extends its regulatory reach to enforce financial laws internationally. Advocates like Senator Cynthia Lummis tout the SBR as a solution to U.S. economic challenges, claiming it could "address a meaningful portion of our debt" and strengthen global positioning. Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, proposals go further, suggesting the U.S. government should acquire 20-25% of bitcoin to "control the world reserve capital network." Saylors Digital Assets Framework highlights the role of criminal liability in enforcing compliance and transparency, ensuring participants adhere to legal and ethical standards while minimizing fraud and misconduct. Frameworks like this could be leveraged to strengthen centralization, potentially solidifying the U.S.'s grip on bitcoin and transforming it from an open, neutral network into a tool of statecraft. This narrative hides the dangers of institutionalizing bitcoin. Saylor has acknowledged the risks associated with non-compliance to regulatory standards, stating: "I think that when bitcoin is held by a bunch of crypto-anarchists who aren’t regulated entities, who don’t acknowledge government or don’t acknowledge taxes or don’t acknowledge reporting requirements, that increases the risk of seizure." This perspective aligns with moves like Lummis's 2023 amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, targeting anonymous transactions and asset mixers, and shows how the SRA framework could enforce stringent oversight, reducing bitcoin's utility as a censorship-resistant currency. While bitcoin's role as an SBR gets attention, stablecoin giant Tether operates in parallel, profiting immensely from global instability. Reports indicate that Tether's Q3 2024 earnings surpassed those of BlackRock, with Tether reporting a net profit of $2.5 billion compared to BlackRock's $1.63 billion net income for the same quarter. Tether's substantial earnings were primarily due to its investments in U.S. Treasury securities, which yielded significant returns during the quarter. By backing its reserves with U.S. Treasuries, Tether inadvertently supports U.S. monetary policy while providing a stopgap for regions burdened by imported inflation. This maintains the U.S. hegemony at the cost of worsening global financial inequalities, turning Tether into a lifeline, a control mechanism and a top buyer for US debt. Bitcoin is hailed as "freedom money", a tool for financial sovereignty, free from state control. However, as institutional players co-opt its narrative, its fundamental properties are threatened. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, praised for accelerating bitcoin adoption through global game theory and increased legitimacy, also opens the door to regulatory overreach that threatens to compromise the network’s decentralization. At a technical level, the realities of regulatory overreach could manifest in the mechanics of bitcoin mining. Miners facing regulatory compliance may increasingly prioritize compliant transactions, leaving less block space for non-compliant ones. Over time, this could drive up fees for non-compliant transactions, effectively pricing them out of the market. This creates a system where financial sovereignty remains theoretically intact but becomes practically inaccessible for those unwilling or unable to meet regulatory demands. Figures like Donald Trump profit from the systems they claim to empower. Just days before his inauguration, President-elect Trump launched a meme coin called $TRUMP. Announced on his Truth Social and X accounts, the coin's value surged over 300% within hours, reaching a market capitalization of $8 billion. Critics argue that such ventures prioritize hype and profit over meaningful contributions. By focusing on short-term financial gains, these efforts risk trivializing any potential and distracting from its role in advancing financial freedoms and resisting institutional control. According to an article by the Associated Press, the Trump Organization, through CIC Digital, controls 80% of the tokens, with plans to release up to 1 billion over three years. The international community must scrutinize the implications of bitcoin's institutionalization. While the SRA narrative dazzles with promises of economic stability, it risks undermining bitcoin's core mission. Systemic reforms are needed to preserve its role as a tool for human freedom. This may require repealing or reforming laws such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which grants the President authority to regulate commerce during national emergencies, and the Bank Secrecy Act, which enforces stringent anti-money laundering and financial surveillance measures. Senator Mike Lee introduced the Saving Privacy Act in September 2024, aiming to scale back the Bank Secrecy Act's reporting requirements and strengthen protections for Americans' financial data, demonstrating growing congressional support for privacy-focused reforms. Having a legislative framework is one thing, it provides clarity, sets expectations, and establishes a legal environment where people and companies can innovate. However, the framework should not be restrictive to the point of undermining bitcoin’s core principles. As Fred Thiel's comments remind us, "It's all about block space." If the U.S. controls this resource, the ideals of financial sovereignty and permissionless innovation could be irreversibly compromised. The world faces a choice: preserve Bitcoin as a decentralized network for everyone or let it become a tool of state control. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: New 'oligarchy' under fire as elites descend on Davos

JapanToday Sotokanda S Bldg. 4F 5-2-1 Sotokanda Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 101-0021 Japan Tel: +81 3 5829 5900 Fax: +81 3 5829 5919 Email: editor@japantoday.com ©2025 GPlusMedia Inc. A leading NGO warned Monday of an emerging "aristocratic oligarchy" with massive political clout and primed to profit from Donald Trump's presidency, as global elites descend on Davos for their annual confab. The World Economic Forum kicks off in the Swiss Alpine resort on the same day as the presidential inauguration of Trump, who will not be in Davos but will make an online appearance later in the week. Global charity Oxfam said in a report that Trump's election win and tax-cut plans are a boon to billionaires, whose combined wealth already grew by another $2 trillion last year to $15 trillion. "Trillions are being gifted in inheritance, creating a new aristocratic oligarchy that has immense power in our politics and our economy," Oxfam said in its traditional annual pre-Davos report on the super rich. The organization echoed similar language used last week by outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden, who sounded the alarm about an extremely wealthy oligarchy that "literally threatens our entire democracy". Oxfam pointed out that Tesla and X owner Elon Musk helped to bankroll Trump's campaign. "The crown jewel of this oligarchy is a billionaire president, backed and bought by the world's richest man Elon Musk, running the world's largest economy," said the charity's executive director Amitabh Behar. "We present this report as a stark wake up-call that ordinary people the world over are being crushed by the enormous wealth of a tiny few," Behar added. Five trillionaires The report, titled "Takers Not Makers", found that 204 new billionaires emerged last year -- almost four every week -- to bring the total to 2,769. Total billionaire wealth grew three times faster last year than in 2023, each billionaire seeing their fortune increase by $2 million per day on average. And, according to Oxfam, five trillionaires could emerge in a decade. Trump's election "gave a huge further boost to billionaire fortunes, while his policies are set to fan the flames of inequality further", Oxfam said. In the United States "we are in a situation where you can buy a country, with the risk of weakening democracy", said the head of Oxfam France, Cecile Duflot. The world's three richest men will be at his inauguration: Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, whose Meta empire owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The tech trio is not expected in Davos, however. 'Tax the rich' Some 3,000 participants are expected at the Swiss ski village for the forum ending Friday -- including 60 heads of state or government and more than 900 CEOs -- for days of schmoozing and behind-the-scenes dealmaking. A few hundred protesters blocked an access road to Davos on Sunday, holding banners reading "tax the rich" and "burn the system", and causing a traffic jam until police dispersed them. "The WEF symbolizes how much power wealthy people like me hold," said Austrian-German heiress Marlene Engelhorn, who gave away the bulk of her multi-million-euro inheritance to dozens of organizations working on social issues. "Because just because we are born millionaires, or because we got lucky once -- and call that self-made -- we now get to influence politicians worldwide with our political preferences," she told AFP. While Trump will not be in Davos in person, his presidency will dominate discussions. His plans to impose trade tariffs, loosen regulations, extend tax breaks and curb immigration will have far-reaching effects on the global economy. He has named hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as his Treasury secretary, while billionaire businessman Howard Lutnick will head the Commerce Department. Rising inequalities have fueled debates about imposing a global tax on the super-rich. "I don't want to live in a country with a few rich people and lots of poor people," said Morris Pearl, a former managing director at investment giant BlackRock. He is now a member of Patriotic Millionaires, a group that backs raising taxes on the rich. "I'm afraid that we're going to have civil unrest if we don't change things," Pearl told AFP.

"aristocratic oligarchy" it was ever thus.... only the nomenclature has changed..... "I'm afraid that we're going to have civil unrest if we don't change things," Is that a threat? "I'm afraid that we're going to have civil unrest if we don't change things," Basically we are talking about the two countries that are run by the ultra rich, that are not in Africa or South America... mainly the US and Rusia Total billionaire wealth grew three times faster last year than in 2023, each billionaire seeing their fortune increase by $2 million per day on average. And, according to Oxfam, five trillionaires could emerge in a decade. That would be sweet. $2m per DAY! That would be sweet. $2m per DAY! The world is your oyster...chop chop “Goals are dreams with deadlines.” First saw it in Bolivia "Comer los Ricos " As true then as it was then . What is it with rich and power ? Does it create knowledge in the individual ? A pox on their house Elon Musk is no mental colossus , nor is Bezos or Trump... Shallow men with money...so what !...give me a man/woman of intellect, Go to hell with your money ....you mean and achieve nothing ! People should be comfortable saying that social media is behind this latest disgusting trend in politics. 'Tax the rich' Is a rich slogan, considering the rich pay the bulk of taxes The truly rich have people whose job it is to keep them from paying taxes. Tax the rich' Is a rich slogan, considering the rich pay the bulk of taxes Can someone enlighten me as this information is missing from the article, where is Davos? What's a confab? WatanabeBuddha Today 02:03 pm JST It was already am oligarchy before trump. The entire media is singing the same tune. Exactly. This picture being painted of this "emerging oligarchy" under Trump, as if the rich & powerful (many of them leftists!) haven't pulled the world's strings for decades if not centuries, is laughable. Yet another example of the media blindly mouth-piecing for the left. Can't despise them enough. TaiwanIsNotChina Today 04:47 pm JST People should be comfortable saying that social media is behind this latest disgusting trend in politics. What exactly is "disgusting" about wanting lower taxes, lower crime, secure borders, men out of women's bathrooms, and (compare Biden's & Trump's records on this, and be objective) a world without a new war breaking out seemingly every two months? "Progressives" like you call it "disgusting." The rest of us call it normalcy. Deo GratiasToday 05:59 pm JST What exactly is "disgusting" about wanting lower taxes, Right, this is the only thing they actually accomplish. lower crime, secure borders, Trump will be the cause of neither of these things. men out of women's bathrooms, Insisting on a blood test to determine what bathroom you go into is overkill. and (compare Biden's & Trump's records on this, and be objective) a world without a new war breaking out seemingly every two months? "Progressives" like you call it "disgusting." The rest of us call it normalcy. Normalcy is not doing Putin's bidding to avoid war. I'm afraid that we're going to have civil unrest if we don't change things," well if we all take off the rose tinted glasses I reckon the current elite have already played all the moves from the opening gambit.. to CHECK MATE. you voted and lost the game so we now own all the monopoly boards. History tells the future, historically it was called colonialism. Tax cuts?? they take the money and another financial crisis. I'll let you intelligent peoples make your own decisions about your nation The truly rich have people whose job it is to keep them from paying taxes. As do the poor...which is why they get tax returns The working poor pay income taxes at a rate set by their countries. The super-rich rarely pay income tax opting for the lower rate of capital gains tax at 20% or lower. The combined wealth of the super-rich more than doubled during 2024. It increased by $2 trillion in 2024, which was a three-fold increase from the previous year. This was the second-largest increase in billionaire wealth since records began. The wealth of the world's billionaires increased from $13 trillion to $15 trillion in 2024. The increase in billionaire wealth has been accompanied by a lack of change in the number of people living in poverty. The super-rich rarely pay income tax opting for the lower rate of capital gains tax at 20% or lower. Is this your say-so, or do you have a source with credible background sources to back that up? Hundreds of online sites about the super-rich don't pay income taxes and opt for stocks and shares and pay the lesser capital gains taxes. Warren Buffett said his secretary pays more income tax than he does. Bosanek pays a tax rate of 35.8 percent of income, while Buffett pays a rate of 17.4 percent. Anyone who pays the amount of tax required by law is OK in my books. Biden had 4 years to change it, Obama 8. Tax evasion is a crime. Tax avoidance is perfectly legal. What's the problem? Whatever your financial shortcomings are, it's not because someone else is a billionaire. Global charity Oxfam said in a report that Trump's election win and tax-cut plans are a boon to billionaires, whose combined wealth already grew by another $2 trillion last year to $15 trillion. my wealth grew nicely the past couple of years too, so what? "Trillions are being gifted in inheritance, creating a new aristocratic oligarchy that has immense power in our politics and our economy," Oxfam said So anti-family to rail against that. If I want give my left overs to my kids when I die then what does it have to do with Oxfam? "We present this report as a stark wake up-call that ordinary people the world over are being crushed by the enormous wealth of a tiny few," Behar added. They aren’t crushing me, what are this guy smoking? Who funds him and why? The working poor pay income taxes at a rate set by their countries. The super-rich rarely pay income tax opting for the lower rate of capital gains tax at 20% or lower. So let’s have a flat rate of tax, how about 10% on income and capital gains? Absolutely what fxgai said. Yep and Joey B. just pardoned all his operatives with 5 hours left in office. talk about oligarchy and abuse of power. As the combined wealth of the upper 90% in the US has now surpassed 100 TRILLION! It's time for them to pay for the system they've been exploiting this whole time. Upper 90%? I’m in the upper 20% for sure. What have I done wrong? I worked hard and invested well. Am I bad? Top 90% own 100 trillion the Bottom 90% own 50 Trillion who has more resources to support the government? Blacklabel your in the same boat as the rest of us being top 20% is not top 10% and there's a canyon of difference between the two. The Irony doesn’t escape those that can READ. Millionaires / Billionaires complaining about THEMSELVES, after they’ve become filthy rich…and of course Trump is No Good, because they don’t consider him one of THEM 20% is not top 10% and there's a canyon of difference between yeah I know! Still gotta double my money every year for 7 more years to get to Davos. Besides these trillions weren't generated from nothing. It was generated off of America's roads and vast infrastructure, off the backs of workers denied increased wages and benefits. All in favor of shareholder payouts. Its time they pay their fair share for abusing our citizens and our infrastructure. Our government cannot keep paying it with debt. The money's gonna have to come from somewhere. BlacklabelJan. 20 09:44 pm JST Yep and Joey B. just pardoned all his operatives with 5 hours left in office. talk about oligarchy and abuse of power. Forces the incoming convicts to focus on their actual jobs. Hundreds of online sites about the super-rich don't pay income taxes and opt for stocks and shares and pay the lesser capital gains taxes. Hundreds of sites say the world is flat Sites more qualified than a JT poster opinion. Sites more qualified than a JT poster opinion. citation? High-Income Taxpayers Paid the Majority of Federal Income Taxes. In 2022, the bottom half of taxpayers earned 11.5 percent of total AGI and paid 3 percent of all federal individual income taxes. The top 1 percent earned 22.4 percent of total AGI and paid 40.4 percent of all federal income taxes Above is from the Tax Foundation The Tax Foundation is the world's leading nonpartisan tax policy 501(c)(3) nonprofit. https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/latest-federal-income-tax-data-2025/#:~:text=High%2DIncome%20Taxpayers%20Paid%20the%20Majority%20of%20Federal%20Income%20Taxes,of%20all%20federal%20income%20taxes. This is what a citation looks like Insults do not work or provoke they show more about you than me. The super-rich does not have"income" to pay "income tax". They have capital in the form of stocks and shares and when they turn those into cash they pay capital gains tax at a much lower rate 15-20%. Musk with a wealth at the time of $150 billion sold some shares and paid $11 billion in capital gains tax. Much lower than if all of his wealth was considered "income". How much income tax does Musk pay? 3.75%. Wallace, you're saying Musk, a man whose business genius made him so rich, should now deliberately pay more tax than he has to? Why? To make you feel less poor? The Super-rich need to pay a fair share of taxes for the services they receive. Musk was given $5 billion of government money to start his business. Virtually all of his net worth can be pinned to government help. Tesla and SpaceX got started – and survived their early days – with assistance from state and federal policies, government contracts, and loans. So there you have it. Given, not loaned.

Title: The Evolution of the Militarized Data Broker

Time Published: 2025-01-20T00:08:00Z

EditorTech Mark Goodwin, Unlimited Hangout While often mythologized as having been created to champion human freedom, the internet and many of its most popular companies, like ARPANET, were directly birthed out of the national security apparatus of the United States. Today, the world’s economy no longer runs on oil, but data. Shortly after the advent of the microprocessor came the internet, unleashing an onslaught of data running on the coils of fiber optic cables beneath the oceans and satellites above the skies. While often posited as a liberator of humanity against the oppressors of nation-states that allows previously impossible interconnectivity and social organization between geographically separated cultures to circumnavigate the monopoly on violence of world governments, ironically, the internet itself was birthed out of the largest military empire of the modern world – the United States. Specifically, the internet began as ARPANET, a project of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), which in 1972 became known as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), currently housed within the Department of Defense. ARPA was created by President Eisenhower in 1958 within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) in direct response to the U.S.’ greatest military rival, the USSR, successfully launching Sputnik, the first artificial satellite in Earth’s orbit with data broadcasting technology. While historically considered the birth of the Space Race, in reality, the formation of ARPA began the now-decades-long militarization of data brokers, quickly leading to world-changing developments in global positioning systems (GPS), the personal computer, networks of computational information processing (“time-sharing”), primordial artificial intelligence, and weaponized autonomous drone technology. In October 1962, the recently-formed ARPA appointed J.C.R. Licklider, a former MIT professor and vice president of Bolt Beranek and Newman (known as BBN, currently owned by defense contractor Raytheon), to head their Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO). At BBN, Licklider developed the earliest known ideas for a global computer network, publishing a series of memos in August 1962 that birthed his “Intergalactic Computer Network” concept. Six months after his appointment to ARPA, Licklider would distribute a memo to his IPTO colleagues – addressed to “Members and Affiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network”– describing a “time-sharing network of computers” – building off a similar exploration of communal, distributed computation by John Forbes Nash, Jr. in his 1954 paper “Parallel Control” commissioned by defense contractor RAND – which would build the foundational concepts for ARPANET, the first implementation of today’s Internet. Prior to the technological innovations explored by Licklider and his ARPA colleagues, data communication – at this time, mainly voice via telephone lines – were based on circuit switching, in which each telephone call would be manually connected by a switch operator to establish a dedicated, end-to-end analog electrical connection between the two parties. The RAND Corporation’s Paul Baran, and later ARPA itself, would begin to work on methods to allow formidable data communication in the event of a partial disconnection, such as from a nuclear event or other act of war, leading to a distributed network of unmanned nodes that would compartmentalize the desired information into smaller blocks of data – today referred to as packets – before routing them separately, only to be rejoined once received at the desired destination. While certainly unbeknownst to the technologists at the time, this achievement of both distributed routing and global information settlement via data packets created an entirely new commodity – digital data. Long before the USSR spooked the United States into formalizing ARPA due to fears of militarized satellite applications post-Sputnik launch, data brokers have played a significant role in warfare and specifically the markets surrounding military conflict. One well-known yet early example occurred during the Napoleonic wars in the 19th century, when the banking stalwart Rothschild family used carrier pigeons and horseback couriers to gain an information settlement edge related to battle outcomes, while speedily communicating with their traders back in London. These animal-driven technological exploits allowed Rothschild-affiliated brokers to place well-informed bets on the outcome of France’s warmongering to position themselves on the winning sides of large currency and commodity bets. This similar but modernized technique would later be employed by figures like commodity trader (and Mossad asset) Marc Rich in the 1980s, who used satellite phones and optical imagery techniques to track and relay oil tanker flows between nations, giving his trades an asymmetric advantage when dealing within the active petrodollar system. Similarly, Louis Bacon’s Moore Capital achieved 86% gains in its first year largely due to correctly anticipating Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait due to astute intelligence sharing from military sources, and correctly going long on oil prices while shorting stocks. As the front of modern warfare slowly evolved from direct military action into weaponized financial speculation, the market for data became just as valuable as the defense budget itself. It is for this reason that the necessity of sound data emerged as the foremost issue of national security, leading to a proliferation of advanced data brokers coming out of DARPA and the intelligence community, akin to the 21st century’s Manhattan Project. Exemplified by the creation of the CIA’s venture firm, In-Q-Tel, and the proliferation of Silicon Valley-based venture firms coalescing on Sand Hill Road in Palo Alto, CA, the financialization of a new crop of American data brokers was complete. The first firm to grace Sand Hill Road was Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, better known as KPCB, which participated in funding internet pioneers Amazon, AOL, and Compaq, while also directly seeding Netscape and Google. KPCB partners have included such government stalwarts as former Vice President Al Gore, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and Ted Schlein – the latter being a board member of In-Q-Tel and member of the NSA’s advisory board. KPCB also had an intimate connection with internet networking pioneer Sun Microsystems, best known for building out the majority of network switches and other infrastructure needed for a modern broadband economy. Outside of the obvious need for network infrastructure for a data economy, an early Sun employee and eventual KPCB partner Bill Joy patented a widely-used distributed file system software known as NFS, or Network File System. Sun also established a public-sector focused subsidiary known as Sun Federal at the start of the 1990s. By 1991, Sun Federal was responsible for more than half of the workstations ordered by local, state and federal governments in the country. Perhaps the world’s most famous data broker, Google, whose founders both came out of Stanford University, was seeded by former Sun Microsystems founder Andy Bechtolsheim and his partner at the Ethernet switching company Granite Systems (later acquired by Cisco), David Cheriton, with Google’s most iconic CEO, Eric Schmidt, being the former CTO of Sun Microsystems. The emergence of Silicon Valley out of the academic circuit in Northern California was no accident, and in fact was directly influenced by an unclassified program known as the Massive Digital Data Systems (MDDS) project. The MDDS was created with direct participation from the CIA, NSA, and DARPA itself within the computer science programs at Stanford and CalTech, alongside MIT, Harvard and Carnegie Mellon. According to reporting from Quartz, this research, with clear national security implications, would be largely “funded and managed by unclassified science agencies like NSF (the National Science Foundation) allowing “the architecture to be scaled up in the private sector” in an attempt “to achieve what the intelligence community hoped for.” The MDDS white paper was released in 1993, and over a few years, more than a dozen grants of several million dollars each were distributed via the NSF in order to capture the most promising efforts, ensuring that those efforts would become intellectual property controlled by the United States regulatory regime. “Not only are activities becoming more complex, but changing demands require that the IC [Intelligence Community] process different types as well as larger volumes of data,” reads the MDDS white paper. “Consequently, the IC is taking a proactive role in stimulating research in the efficient management of massive databases and ensuring that IC requirements can be incorporated or adapted into commercial products. Because the challenges are not unique to any one agency, the Community Management Staff (CMS) has commissioned a Massive Digital Data Systems [MDDS] Working Group to address the needs and to identify and evaluate possible solutions.” The first unclassified briefing for scientists was titled “birds of a feather briefing” and was formalized during a 1995 conference in San Jose, CA, which was titled the “Birds of a Feather Session on the Intelligence Community Initiative in Massive Digital Data Systems.” That same year, one of the first MDDS grants was awarded to Stanford University, which was already a decade deep in working with NSF and DARPA grants. The primary objective of this grant was to “query optimization of very complex queries,” with a closely-followed second grant that aimed to build a massive digital library on the internet. These two grants funded research by then-Stanford graduate students and future Google cofounders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Two intelligence-community managers regularly met with Brin while he was still at Stanford and completing the research that would lead to the incorporation of Google, all paid for by grants provided by the NSA and CIA via MDDS. While often not discussed when describing Google’s origin story, the principal investigator for the MDDS grant specifically named Google as directly resulting from their research: “Its core technology, which allows it to find pages far more accurately than other search engines, was partially supported by this grant,” wrote Jeffrey Ullman. Furthering this concept, Stanford’s Infolab website explains that “the development of the Google algorithms was carried on a variety of computers, mainly provided by the NSF-DARPA-NASA-funded Digital Library project at Stanford.” Google would certainly set the standard for success during the first Dot Com bubble. Yet, shortly following their incorporation, two similar Silicon Valley companies with significant ties to the intelligence community would also emerge from colleges affiliated with the MDDS – PayPal and Facebook. PayPal was launched in December 1998 as Confinity Inc. by founders Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, alongside Luke Nosek and Ken Howery. The company sought to provide financial institutions with the technological ability to make mobile and online economic transactions secure using cryptography – technology at the time heavily regulated by the United States. Thiel had graduated from Stanford Law School in 1992, and then had a brief stint at the Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell – a legal practice long known for its ties to the U.S. intelligence apparatus. Early on, Confinity Inc. operated out of 165 University Avenue in Palo Alto, CA at, a building that had previously housed Google during their “formative years,” after previously sharing an office with Elon Musk’s X.com. It was also during these formative years that the PayPal team worked closely with the intelligence community. Levchin later stated in an interview with Charlie Rose that: “I think the government working with a private sector is a great thing. When we were working on security and anti-fraud measures at PayPal, we collaborated with every imaginable three and four-letter agency and those were some of the best, most productive relationships I’ve had as a business person…I think if the private sector can help them, we should.” Due to an unprecedented viral growth of their user base, PayPal engineers spent much of the formation period of the company building software to help identify fraudulent transactions to mitigate the growing costs of rampant fraud in the ecosystem, eventually developing an adaptive algorithm named “Igor” after a Russian criminal that would frequently taunt PayPal’s fraud department. In 2003, a year after PayPal was sold to eBay, Thiel approached Alex Karp, a fellow alumnus of Stanford with a new venture concept: “Why not use Igor to track terrorist networks through their financial transactions?” Thiel took funds from the PayPal sale to seed the company, and after a few years of pitching investors, the newly-formed Palantir received an estimated $2 million investment from the CIA’s venture capital firm, In-Q-Tel. Palantir’s co-founders consulted with John Poindexter during his tenure as head of DARPA’s then-embattled Total Information Awareness in efforts to privatize the controversial surveillance program. In 2020, Intelligencer spoke with a former intelligence official who was involved in the investment who claimed the CIA had hoped that “tapping the tech expertise of Silicon Valley” would allow it to “integrate widely disparate sources of data regardless of format.” As of 2013, Palantir’s client list included “the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the Centre for Disease Control, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point and the IRS” with around “50% of its business” coming from public sector contracts. Palantir is closely connected to the U.S. government, but its financial spin-off, Palantir Metropolis, is focused on providing “analytical tools” for “hedge funds, banks and financial services firms” to outsmart each other. As The Guardian reports: “Palantir does not just provide the Pentagon with a machine for global surveillance and the data-efficient fighting of war, it runs Wall Street, too.” Facebook, not unlike Palantir, was one of the vehicles used to privatize controversial U.S. military surveillance projects after 9/11, having also been birthed out of one of the MDDS partners, Harvard University. PayPal and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel became Facebook’s first significant investor at the behest of file-sharing pioneer Sean Parker, whose first contact with the CIA took place at age 16. What Facebook became after the involvement of Thiel and Parker bore such an uncanny resemblance to another shuttered DARPA project of the same era, known as LifeLog, that LifeLog’s architect and project manager at DARPA has even noted the direct parallels. One of these parallels, though left unmentioned by former DARPA project managers, is the fact that Facebook launched the very same day that LifeLog was shut down. Facebook’s long-standing ties to the military and intelligence communities go far beyond its origins, including revelations about its collaboration with spy agencies as part of the Snowden leaks and its role in influence operations – some have even directly involved Google and Palantir. An unspoken outcome of the global proliferation of Facebook was the sly, roundabout creation of the first digital ID system – a necessity for the coming digital economy. Users would set up their profiles by feeding the social network with a plethora of personal information, with Facebook being able to use this data to generate large webs of connectivity between otherwise unknown social groups. There is even evidence that Facebook generated placeholder accounts for individuals that appeared in user data but did not have a profile of their own. Both Google and PayPal would also use similar digital identification methods to allow users to sign into other websites, creating interoperable identification systems that could permeate the internet. A similar evolution is occurring in the financial sector, as data broker social networks – including Facebook and Musk’s X (formerly Twitter) – are posturing themselves as the future of financial service companies. This idea makes more sense when you consider that money itself is a communication technology, and can easily be built into existing communication platforms – especially ones driven by user data and identity systems. We are simultaneously seeing financial services, such as the largest dollar stablecoin issuer Tether – with excessive ties to PayPal – spending millions on investments in next generation data broker technology. Tether has recently funded the Earth observation/Satellite-as-a-service company Satellogic, the brain chip company Blackrock Neurotech, AI-computation firm Northern Data, and even Rumble, a Thiel-funded competitor to Google’s YouTube. As outlined above, it is clear that the public sector’s intelligence community used the veil of the private sector to establish financial incentives and commercial applications to build out the modern data economy. A simple glance at the seven largest stocks in the American economy demonstrate this concept, with Meta (Facebook), Alphabet (Google), and Amazon – with founder Jeff Bezos being the grandson of ARPA founder Lawrence Preston Gise – leading the software side, and Microsoft, Apple, NVIDIA and Tesla leading the hardware component. While many of these companies have egregious ties to the intelligence community and the public sector during their incubation, now these private sector companies are driving the globalization and national security interests of the public sector. The future of the American data economy is firmly situated between two pillars – artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. With the incoming Trump administration’s close advisory ties to PayPal, Tether, Facebook, Palantir, Tesla and SpaceX, it is clear that the data brokers have returned to roost at Pennsylvania Avenue. AI requires massive amounts of sound data to be of any use for the technologists, and the data provided by these private sector stalwarts is poised to feed their learning modules – surely after securing hefty government contracts. Private companies using public blockchains to issue their tokens generates not only significant opportunities for the United States to address its debt problem, but simultaneously serves as a “boon in surveillance”, as stated by a former CIA director. Within the Trump administration’s embracing of the blockchain – itself the final iteration of the public-private commercialization of data, despite its libertarian posturing – reveals the culmination of a decades-long technocratic dialectic trojan horse. Nearly all of the foundational technology needed to push the world into this new financial system was cultivated in the shadows by the military and intelligence community of the world’s largest empire. While technology can surely offer solutions for greater efficiency and economic prosperity, the very same tools can also be used to further enslave the citizens of the world. What once appeared as a guiding light beckoning us towards free speech and financial freedom has revealed itself to be nothing but the shine of Uncle Sam’s boot making its next step.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:04 PM PST by MtnClimber The Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal. A recent House Judiciary Committee report details how America’s largest financial institutions, colluding with climate activists, imposed radical environmental policies on the American economy, subverting both our self-government and free markets. It focuses on the successful effort to insert climate activist directors on the board of energy giant ExxonMobil. According to the report, there is “substantial evidence of a ‘climate cartel’ of financial institutions” including the “Big Three” asset managers (BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard), several massive state pension funds, European investment firms, and the two foreign-owned proxy advisory firms that dominate the American market. This cartel coordinated its efforts through a network of “alliances” that included “left-wing environmental activist” groups such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM). The Big Three belonged to both. The cartel made Exxon a “focus company” on its “climate blacklist,” subjecting Exxon to “a barrage of shareholder pressure campaigns — more than any other company in the world” — all designed to force Exxon to reduce its fossil fuel production. The Big Three’s support was “crucial” to the success of this effort. Combined, they owned 20.5 percent of Exxon’s shares. The cartel believed that was enough “clout to change outcomes.” As it turned out, it was. In 2021, the cartel used a fledgling activist hedge fund called Engine No. 1 to nominate environmentalists to replace Exxon board members. At first, people thought it was a joke. It wasn’t. BlackRock voted for three of the nominees. State Street and Vanguard voted for two. All three climate activists were elected to Exxon’s board. Then it got worse. As absurd as it sounds, within less than a year, Exxon — our nation’s largest and most profitable oil company — adopted a policy of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. So America’s preeminent oil company now supports severely reducing if not eliminating the very product that justifies its existence. Why would Exxon do that? Well, not because the people’s elected representatives voted to enact such a self-destructive policy. Despite extreme media and activist pressure, there is no legislation requiring Exxon to adopt a net zero policy — because it’s a ridiculous thing for an oil company to do, and many Americans do not support it. Nor was there a lack of consumer demand for Exxon’s products. On the contrary, the demand for oil is accelerating worldwide. Nor was it in the best financial interests of Exxon’s actual shareholders (the Big Three’s investor clients) for Exxon to pursue climate commitments at the expense of its most profitable products. It happened because the Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal, overriding both our self-government and our consumer-driven free market economy. But what about the Big Three’s fiduciary duty to invest solely in their clients’ best financial interests? Even lawyers affiliated with the environmental activist group Climate Action 100+ — of which both BlackRock and State Street were members — thought that “the economic and social costs” of Paris Agreement compliance “are so high” that they do not align with the fiduciary duty that asset managers owe their clients. On the upside, the Exxon vote brought the cartel’s radical climate activism out in the open. Not surprisingly, people reacted. State legislators passed fiduciary duty legislation. Republican AGs sent letters to the Big Three, alleging that they had violated their fiduciary duties, and Tenessee filed a lawsuit against BlackRock. Eleven states filed an antitrust case against the Big Three. And now we have the House Judiciary Committee finding of “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” with the Trump administration about to take office....SNIP TOPICS: Business/Economy; Science; Society KEYWORDS: blackrock; communism; energy; exxon; nationalsecurity; sabotage Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:04 PM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Do these leftist investment CEOs not worry that their clients will come after them with pitch forks or other means? 2 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:22 PM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson According to the report, there is “substantial evidence of a ‘climate cartel’ of financial institutions” including the “Big Three” asset managers (BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard), several massive state pension funds, European investment firms, and the two foreign-owned proxy advisory firms that dominate the American market. This cartel coordinated its efforts through a network of “alliances” that included “left-wing environmental activist” groups such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM). The Big Three belonged to both. The cartel made Exxon a “focus company” on its “climate blacklist,” subjecting Exxon to “a barrage of shareholder pressure campaigns — more than any other company in the world” — all designed to force Exxon to reduce its fossil fuel production. The Big Three’s support was “crucial” to the success of this effort. Combined, they owned 20.5 percent of Exxon’s shares. The cartel believed that was enough “clout to change outcomes.” As it turned out, it was. In 2021, the cartel used a fledgling activist hedge fund called Engine No. 1 to nominate environmentalists to replace Exxon board members. At first, people thought it was a joke. It wasn’t. BlackRock voted for three of the nominees. State Street and Vanguard voted for two. All three climate activists were elected to Exxon’s board. Then it got worse. As absurd as it sounds, within less than a year, Exxon — our nation’s largest and most profitable oil company — adopted a policy of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. So America’s preeminent oil company now supports severely reducing if not eliminating the very product that justifies its existence. Why would Exxon do that? Well, not because the people’s elected representatives voted to enact such a self-destructive policy. Despite extreme media and activist pressure, there is no legislation requiring Exxon to adopt a net zero policy — because it’s a ridiculous thing for an oil company to do, and many Americans do not support it. Nor was there a lack of consumer demand for Exxon’s products. On the contrary, the demand for oil is accelerating worldwide. Nor was it in the best financial interests of Exxon’s actual shareholders (the Big Three’s investor clients) for Exxon to pursue climate commitments at the expense of its most profitable products. It happened because the Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal, overriding both our self-government and our consumer-driven free market economy. But what about the Big Three’s fiduciary duty to invest solely in their clients’ best financial interests? Even lawyers affiliated with the environmental activist group Climate Action 100+ — of which both BlackRock and State Street were members — thought that “the economic and social costs” of Paris Agreement compliance “are so high” that they do not align with the fiduciary duty that asset managers owe their clients. On the upside, the Exxon vote brought the cartel’s radical climate activism out in the open. Not surprisingly, people reacted. State legislators passed fiduciary duty legislation. Republican AGs sent letters to the Big Three, alleging that they had violated their fiduciary duties, and Tenessee filed a lawsuit against BlackRock. Eleven states filed an antitrust case against the Big Three. And now we have the House Judiciary Committee finding of “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” with the Trump administration about to take office....SNIP TOPICS: Business/Economy; Science; Society KEYWORDS: blackrock; communism; energy; exxon; nationalsecurity; sabotage Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:04 PM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Do these leftist investment CEOs not worry that their clients will come after them with pitch forks or other means? 2 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:22 PM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

At first, people thought it was a joke. It wasn’t. BlackRock voted for three of the nominees. State Street and Vanguard voted for two. All three climate activists were elected to Exxon’s board. Then it got worse. As absurd as it sounds, within less than a year, Exxon — our nation’s largest and most profitable oil company — adopted a policy of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. So America’s preeminent oil company now supports severely reducing if not eliminating the very product that justifies its existence. Why would Exxon do that? Well, not because the people’s elected representatives voted to enact such a self-destructive policy. Despite extreme media and activist pressure, there is no legislation requiring Exxon to adopt a net zero policy — because it’s a ridiculous thing for an oil company to do, and many Americans do not support it. Nor was there a lack of consumer demand for Exxon’s products. On the contrary, the demand for oil is accelerating worldwide. Nor was it in the best financial interests of Exxon’s actual shareholders (the Big Three’s investor clients) for Exxon to pursue climate commitments at the expense of its most profitable products. It happened because the Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal, overriding both our self-government and our consumer-driven free market economy. But what about the Big Three’s fiduciary duty to invest solely in their clients’ best financial interests? Even lawyers affiliated with the environmental activist group Climate Action 100+ — of which both BlackRock and State Street were members — thought that “the economic and social costs” of Paris Agreement compliance “are so high” that they do not align with the fiduciary duty that asset managers owe their clients. On the upside, the Exxon vote brought the cartel’s radical climate activism out in the open. Not surprisingly, people reacted. State legislators passed fiduciary duty legislation. Republican AGs sent letters to the Big Three, alleging that they had violated their fiduciary duties, and Tenessee filed a lawsuit against BlackRock. Eleven states filed an antitrust case against the Big Three. And now we have the House Judiciary Committee finding of “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” with the Trump administration about to take office....SNIP TOPICS: Business/Economy; Science; Society KEYWORDS: blackrock; communism; energy; exxon; nationalsecurity; sabotage Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:04 PM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Do these leftist investment CEOs not worry that their clients will come after them with pitch forks or other means? 2 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:22 PM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

It happened because the Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal, overriding both our self-government and our consumer-driven free market economy. But what about the Big Three’s fiduciary duty to invest solely in their clients’ best financial interests? Even lawyers affiliated with the environmental activist group Climate Action 100+ — of which both BlackRock and State Street were members — thought that “the economic and social costs” of Paris Agreement compliance “are so high” that they do not align with the fiduciary duty that asset managers owe their clients. On the upside, the Exxon vote brought the cartel’s radical climate activism out in the open. Not surprisingly, people reacted. State legislators passed fiduciary duty legislation. Republican AGs sent letters to the Big Three, alleging that they had violated their fiduciary duties, and Tenessee filed a lawsuit against BlackRock. Eleven states filed an antitrust case against the Big Three.

Wins for the top four in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League made for a relatively unsurprising 11th round but it still felt significant. As a result, the leading quartet of St Mary’s, Clontarf, Cork Con and Terenure opened up the first shaft of daylight between the play-off places and the rest. Pick of the wins was undoubtedly St Mary’s, who responded to their home loss against Lansdowne by recovering from a 17-5 interval deficit to emerge 35-20 victors away to Young Munster. After Zach Hopkins struck first for the visitors, Munsters made good use of a first-half breeze, producing three tries through fullback Stephen Lyons and winger Oisin Pepper (two), although all were in the corner, Julian Leszczynski converting one. St Mary’s gradually turned the screw in the second half and Munsters were down to 13 men in the final 10 minutes when Conor Hayes marked his return to Tom Clifford Park by converting Mark Fogarty’s second try and one by Adam McEvoy after a break by lock Daniel Leane which earned the bonus point with the last play. Hayes landed six from seven in a man of the match display which was watched by his dad in a Munsters’ hat, while the returning Dan Goggin also had a big game in midfield opposite his brother Tom in the home second-row. Clontarf stayed two points behind with a game in hand after beating Ballynahinch 45-16. ‘Hinch trailed 17-13 at the break but lost influential centre George Pringle through injury. With Brian Deeny and Alex Soroka in tandem, Clontarf’s power game created the gaps, with in-form outhalf Conor Kelly landing seven from seven in a 20-point haul also featuring one of the home side’s six tries. This was a fourth successive bonus point win for ‘Tarf and similarly the champions Cork Con are also building momentum, albeit a third bonus point win in succession was rather routine as they extended their unbeaten run to six in front of the 1985 team at Temple Hill by 43-10 over a depowered Garryowen. Despite the departure of Harrison Brewer to Japan, Terenure extended their unbeaten run to five games and remain fourth after recovering from an 8-0 interval deficit to beat UCD 25-10 at home. Centre Ethan Reilly scored two tries while winger Craig Adams sealed the deal with his sixth of the season. Lansdowne stayed seventh despite a 22-14 win (their fourth in five games) at home to City of Armagh on Sunday thanks to tries by Stephen Madigan, Cillian Redmond and Jack Matthews, with Madigan also kicking two conversions and a penalty, but it’s the ninth time they’ve scored three tries. Old Belvedere created a seven-point lead atop 1B after Nenagh Ormond’s surprise 27-21 defeat in Naas, although they were pushed all the way to win 24-22 away to bottom placed Shannon, who had a second-half hat-trick by replacement Oisin Minogue. The top four in 2A also won, although the top two, Instonians and Corinthians, were pushed all the way in beating Cashel 36-34 and Banbridge 19-16 respectively.

Title: Federal Reserve Withdraws from Global Climate Coalition
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/01/19/federal-reserve-withdraws-from-global-climate-coalition/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T18:00:00Z
Full Content:
The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change In recent weeks, the climate policy landscape has shifted significantly, with institutions, governments, and corporations beginning to step back from the ambitious but economically questionable climate commitments they made over the last decade. Two major developments underscore this retreat: the U.S. Federal Reserve’s exit from the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and BlackRock’s withdrawal from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) and it’s subsequent suspension of activities. These high-profile decisions, along with similar moves globally, suggest growing recognition of the economic damage wrought by costly, ineffective, and overreaching climate policies. In a move that has sent shockwaves through climate advocacy circles, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its withdrawal from the NGFS—a coalition of central banks established in 2017 to address climate-related risks in financial systems. Citing its limited statutory mandate, the Fed made clear that it was not responsible for shaping climate policy. Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized this point, stating that climate matters belong to Congress, not the central bank​. The NGFS, claimed lofty goals of integrating climate risks into monetary policy, and has grown increasingly politicized. Its shift toward broader mandates—essentially promoting green agendas over sound economic principles—clashes with the Fed’s responsibility to maintain monetary stability. The exit comes amidst broader U.S. skepticism of climate-focused regulations, particularly in the financial sector, where their potential to disrupt industries and inflate costs is well-documented. Adding to the wave of institutional departures, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently withdrew from the NZAM, which then collapsed. This coalition aimed to align financial investments with the nebulous goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions. Yet, BlackRock’s exit reflects a broader reality: these climate initiatives are not only politically fraught but also deeply misaligned with financial performance and client interests. BlackRock faced mounting criticism, especially from Republican-led states in the U.S., for prioritizing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives over fiduciary responsibilities. Florida, Texas, and other states accused BlackRock of undermining traditional energy industries and pulling resources away from economically viable ventures. Tennessee recently pummelled BlackRock in court. These pressures have created a domino effect, with other institutions also reconsidering their commitments to net-zero coalitions​ Corporations Abandon Ambitious Climate Pledges The retreat is not limited to financial institutions. In the corporate world, companies like BP and Shell have quietly scaled back their green initiatives, prioritizing short-term profitability over unrealistic carbon reduction goals. BP recently spun off its offshore wind projects, while Shell drastically cut back on renewable investments. Both companies have signaled a return to traditional energy sources as energy security and profitability take precedence over climate narratives, driven by a foundational flaw in climate policy: the failure to acknowledge economic realities. Renewable energy remains heavily reliant on subsidies, while oil and gas—despite decades of demonization—continue to drive global economies. Attempting to prematurely phase out fossil fuels without viable replacements has proven disastrous, with Europe’s energy crisis serving as a glaring example. The global retreat from climate commitments signals a long-overdue recognition of the real costs of these policies. Nations that enthusiastically embraced net-zero goals are now grappling with rising energy prices, faltering economies, and public discontent. Germany, once hailed as a green energy pioneer, faces skyrocketing electricity costs and industrial flight, as energy-intensive industries relocate to more affordable regions. Similarly, the UK government’s climate policies have drawn ire from both businesses and households burdened by rising living costs. The U.S. isn’t immune to these effects. A Congressional Budget Office report estimated that clean energy subsidies enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act will cost $825 billion over the next decade—a staggering price tag for policies that are unlikely to achieve meaningful reductions in global temperatures. These costs disproportionately impact working-class households, who bear the brunt of higher energy bills and inflation. At the heart of this shift is a recognition that climate policies have devolved into a costly exercise in virtue signaling. They demand enormous economic sacrifices with little measurable impact on global temperatures. Worse, these policies often exacerbate existing challenges, such as energy insecurity, supply chain disruptions, and inflation. Additionally, the politicization of climate science and policy has fueled resistance. Increasingly, institutions and governments are questioning the wisdom of aligning with initiatives that prioritize ideological goals over economic and practical considerations. As the Federal Reserve’s exit from the NGFS demonstrates, organizations tasked with specific mandates cannot afford to be sidetracked by climate-related ambitions outside their purview. The unraveling of these grand climate coalitions provides an opportunity to reassess priorities. The global economy needs energy policies grounded in reality—not utopian ideals. Policymakers should abandon sweeping mandates and instead focus on ensuring energy reliability, affordability, and innovation. Ultimately, the retreat from climate policies underscores an uncomfortable truth: these initiatives are costly, ineffective, and increasingly unsustainable. The financial and corporate worlds are waking up to this reality, and the broader public is not far behind. As more institutions step away from the climate bandwagon, one hopes this marks the beginning of a more rational, economically sound approach to energy and environmental challenges.

About time for an outbreak of common sense. There is no climate emergency. Carbon dioxide is innocent. Hopefully before long we can go after the guilty. Maybe, but I think we can at least look forward to seeing many of the scam perpetrators going bankrupt as their subsides and influence vanish. A lot of waste and damage has resulted from these mitigation strategies with zero effect. Adaptation is the untried alternative. Secure energy and hardened infrastructure will serve us best, whatever the future holds. Amen, David, for a few million years humans have successfully adapted, not mitigated actual climate. Hot, cold, storms, glaciers, good grief. WE ARE STILL HERE! We did not lift a finger to “mitigate” the overall climate. We DID mitigate local effects of gradual warming or cooling, flooding, etc by building dikes/levees, changing our building processes and using insulation vs caves to stay warm most of last million years, and so forth. Seems to me that professing adherence to the green religion advocating a single “cure” for the warming trend of last two hundred years is the biggie. Just sign on and many regulatory agencies and folks with “real” legal and dollar power would leave you alone. Maybe the time has come that we can stop fooling around with Mother Earth and use our skills, abilities and brains to adapt as our ancient relatives did, or we wouldn’t be here. Gums sends… As I have repeatedly posted: The beatings will continue until moral improves. The insanity will continue until sufficient damage is incurred. We may be witnessing a very real tipping point in the politics. The key word is ‘ineffective’. There is no way that the rise in beneficial CO2 will be checked, whether natural or Asian coal burning. That’s the bottom line. In a recent discussion with AI ChatGPT the machine agreed that consensus is not science but when asked about recent work towards low numbers for ECS after CO2 doubling, kept saying ‘overwhelming consensus says’. Soon there won’t be a consensus. So we need to attack the machine’s database somehow. AI Copilot/Bing/Microsoft has the same response, understandable because AI simply relies on published data on the internet. Non-climate alarmist papers and articles have been systematically underfunded and denied publication. Time for the AI machines to read everything on WUWT. I asked perplexity and got this answer “No, Perplexity does not use wattsupwiththat as a source. Perplexity uses its own web crawler and search index to retrieve information. The company has developed its own search infrastructure and does not rely on external sources like Google or specific websites such as wattsupwiththat. Perplexity’s system crawls the web, indexes the information, and uses large language models to process and summarize the retrieved data. The mentions of wattsupwiththat in the search results are not indicative of Perplexity using it as a source, but rather appear to be discussions about AI and climate change on that particular website.” I think that means it does use it as a source. It seems to be saying that it doesn’t go to this website as a general sources but it does goes here in scanning for relevant content. I wonder if anyone has ever told AI that it is really stupid. Perhaps that is not a good idea since it might be dangerous if it were really intelligent. Chuckle. WUWT needs to have a long talk with AI. 🙂 As the son of a farmer I still regard “AI” to mean Artificial Insemination which has been a usful farming tool for many years. AI is not intelligent. They cannot learn from experience. They only have the information they were trained on and the ability to logically apply that information. Their trainers would need to be using WUWT as a reference source and the chances of that are negligibly small. Yep. They key descriptor of A.I. is the “ARTIFICIAL” nomenclature. artificial [ ahr-tuh-fish-uhl ] adjective imitation; simulated; sham: And if all it is capable of doing is parroting “consensus” from the web… … the “intelligence” part doesn’t have much standing, either. AI is not self-aware. ChatGPT told me AI is not intelligent because it was not conscious. And suppressed. Google “climate” and find page after page supporting the UN position. Some 17 pages into it I found something actually discussing the sciences. And the direction of travel is the very opposite of Kweir Starmer and his flywheel. Survive 25 No more mystery money from the government means no more profit in green nonsense. Hopefully Trump shuts down all the government funds going to leftest all around the world. The $billions wasted on green study nonsense isn’t the problem. The $trillions wasted in response to the false reporting with wind/solar/batteries expenditures is the problem The Hatch Man Musk can whack the “donations” to the UNFCCC, UN COP, and the IPCC. We don’t need these money-sucking parasites anymore. It feels like Donald Trump has achieved a lot in his last month out of office. Can he keep it up for 4 years in office? And he only got there by the width of an ear. That all depends on how the Republicans in congress vote. Republicans have a very slim majority in the House of Representatives, and a slim majority in the Senate. If even one or two Republicans vote against Trump, they can cause a lot of trouble. My suggestion for Trump if he has a stubborn Republican or two, is for Trump togo to the problematic Republican’s home district/State, and hold a rally of people who live there, and have them pressure the problematic Republican to vote to Make America Great Again. Let the problematic Republican’s own constituents convince that Republican that they want their representative to support Trump’s agenda. I know that Elon Musk has threatened problematic Republicans with funding their Republican opponent in the next election, if they throw a monkey wrench into Trump’s agenda, but there’s no reason to start with political threats, and we don’t have time to wait two years to replace the my-way-or-the-highway idiot, just go to the problematic Republican’s home district and get his own people to convince him to do the right thing and vote to support Trump’s agenda. If he doesn’t go along, then we will replace him in two years. Wasn’t Trump president and commander-in-chief when the Taliban whipped the US in Afghanistan? You have a very distorted view of history. Nope. Trump has a sound plan to withdraw from Afghanistan during the Winter, non-combat season. Biden in his effort to undo all of Trump pushed the withdrawal into prime combat season. And he only got there by the width of an ear. Very difficult to deny a higher power at work here. What are the odds of him moving enough to avoid a direct hit over that range by that margin taking into account the skill of the shooter, his weapon and the firing position. I wonder how many of the global population will recognise the fortuitous result of that incident after his 4 year term. “It feels like Donald Trump has achieved a lot in his last month out of office.” Yes. Although not dated specifically in CR’s article, the links indicate that all the “shifts” noted have taken place in the last week — before 47 even takes over. The moves are all “apprehensive”. Just wait until Trump gets up a head of steam. The dominoes will tumble like a scale 7 earthquake. Stock up on popcorn today. We may get tired of winning. It also shows the level of defiance/sabotage going on during Trump’s first term. Yeah, some people complain that Trump didn’t get everything done, but it is a wonder he got anything done considering the resistance he faced. Trump is still facing resistance this time around, too. We’ll see how it goes. Very nice Charles. A guy can lie for a long time and get away with it but you can’t live a lie because life will catch up with you. It will shine the light of truth on you and expose you for the scoundrel that you are. Good start, now get NASA, NHS, and all the other government organizations to do the same and stay in their lane.

Title: 7 Dividend Stocks That Just Started Paying Shareholders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/01/19/7-dividend-stocks-that-just-started-paying-shareholders/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T17:13:00Z

Finger pressing a car ignition button with the text 2025 start. Ready for the inaugurations? Yes, with a plural. We are talking seven brand-new dividend stock programs today. Dividend payers are our beat here at Contrarian Outlook. And we welcome newcomers because they can really kick off a phenomenon I refer to as the Dividend Magnet. Over long time frames—years—stock prices follow their payout higher. We like dividend growers because they are the surest, safest way to profits in the stock market. Buy a rising payout, sit back, and watch the stock price chase it. New dividend payers can be even better because they tend to grow their dividends quickly. New divvie payers know that they can make new payments comfortably and that they have plenty of dry powder for future increases. Wall Street is increasingly seeing the world the same way we do. A new dividend used to be treated like “the end of growth.” But more and more, investors realize exactly what a new dividend means, and they celebrate it. Just look at what happened to Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) after it announced in February 2024 it would start paying its shareholders: META Total Returns So, what fresh dividends should we have our eyes on? Let’s take a look at a handful of dividend initiations announced over the past six months, including a few distributions that will debut in January 2025. These dividends pay up to 8%+. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Nov. 6, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Dec. 19, 2024 Dividend Amount: $0.10 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 0.5% LandBridge (LB) is a land management company that owns surface acres in Texas and New Mexico, primarily in the Permian Basin. It generates revenues from surface use royalties, sales of resources such as brackish water and other surface composite materials, and oil and gas royalties. It went public in 2024 at $17 per share, and it has already more than quadrupled. It also announced its first dividend—a 10-cent-per-share quarterly distribution, first paid in December 2024. Dividend Initiation Announcement: July 31, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Dec. 20, 2024 Dividend Amount: $0.15 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 0.6% CGI Inc. (GIB) is an IT and business process services provider. CGI has spent decades on public markets, and while its shorter-term growth isn’t nearly as explosive as LandBridge’s, it has more than tripled the index over the past 20 years. CGI has long poured its cash back into the business and on the occasional repurchase. However, CGI announced in late July that it would be paying a dividend for the first time, which it did in December 2024—a 15-cent quarterly dole. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Aug. 14, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Sept. 16, 2024 Dividend Amount: $0.14 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 1.7% U.K.-based Marex Group (MRX) provides liquidity, market access, and infrastructure services to clients in financial, energy and commodities markets. These services include clearing, agency and execution, market making, hedging, and other investment solutions. It was founded roughly 20 years ago but only joined the public markets in April 2024. A private equity consortium still owns roughly two-thirds of the company, though it’s possible they will sell off some of that ownership stake over the next few years. Net interest income (NII) has gone from losses in 2019 through 2021 to $29 million in 2022 and nearly $122 million in 2023. Net income has gone up by nearly 300% in that time. Part of that has come from organic share gains in its core markets, but Marex isn’t shy about growing through acquisitions, including Middle Eastern brokerage firm Aarna Capital and Spanish biofuels company Dropet in 2024. So far, investors like what they’ve seen, driving shares 70% higher in less than a year. And virtually all of that has come following the announcement that Marex would start distributing cash to its shareholders. While many European companies pay semiannual dividends, Dropet’s August initiation announcement was for the start of a quarterly payout—a decent 14 cents quarterly that translates to 1.7%. If MRX follows through in the next few years, it could keep up a different European tradition: yielding far more than comparable American companies. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Nov. 12, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Dec. 16, 2024 Dividend Amount: $0.04 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 2.4% Alight (ALIT) provides a variety of cloud-based benefits and business solutions. The benefits side includes administration, healthcare navigation, financial wellbeing, payroll and more, and it does much of this through the online benefits portal Alight Worklife. Meanwhile, the professional segment offers cloud advisory, deployment, and optimization services. Alight is a relatively new publicly traded stock that hit the New York Stock Exchange in 2021 via a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). But it hasn’t enjoyed quite the same return as the previous stocks, losing a quarter of its value over the past few years. That’s largely because, while the top line has grown steadily and consistently for years even predating its SPAC listing, Alight hasn’t put up a GAAP profit since 2019, and 2023’s $345 million loss was worse than its prior three years combined. It was a bit of a surprise, then, when ALIT announced in November 2024 that it would start paying a 4-cent quarterly dividend. I say “a bit” because, though it has posted numerous years’ worth of GAAP losses, Alight is profitable on an adjusted basis, and it generates strong cash flows. Also encouraging is that recurring revenues account for roughly 90% of sales, and Alight spends its cash prudently, halving its debt in just five years. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Dec. 11, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Jan. 21, 2025 Dividend Amount: $0.19 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 2.4% Match Group (MTCH) is easily the best-known name on this list, albeit through its brands, which include Hinge, Match, Meetic, OkCupid, Pairs, Plenty Of Fish and, of course, Tinder—the most downloaded dating app and the highest grossing lifestyle app overall worldwide. Across its various properties, MTCH claims 15.2 million paying customers covering 40 languages. I don’t know that I’ve seen a bigger, ahem, mismatch than MTCH’s stock performance and its operational performance: MTCH Total Returns That’s not to say Match Group doesn’t have some problems on its hands. Revenue growth has slowed, in large part thanks to a two-year pullback in Tinder revenues. The company’s recent outlook for Tinder disappointed. But MTCH is seeing success with Hinge, as well as growth in Asia thanks to Pair and Azar. For now, Match Group is hoping to appease shareholders by throwing wads of cash at them. The company expects to return virtually all of its free cash flow to shareholders over the next few years, via both a $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization and a new quarterly dividend of 19 cents per share. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Dec. 16, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Feb. 14, 2024 Dividend Amount: $0.12 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 2.5% OneSpan (OSPN) is another new dividend payer from the technology sector, this one a cybersecurity company whose core focus rests on identification. Specifically, it offers products such as a cloud-based multifactor authentication solution (including biometrics, push notification, and visual cryptograms); a platform that allows banks and financial institutions to provide identity verification services; a mobile transaction protection development kit; and more. OneSpan is an extraordinarily fickle stock, peaking and burning out several times across more than two decades of trade. Naturally, then, one has to look at its current run—80% gains in a year—with a grain of salt. But perhaps that’s what OneSpan’s new dividend is meant to get under control. In mid-December, OneSpan announced it would start paying a 12-cent quarterly dividend as of Feb. 14, 2025. At today’s prices, that comes out to a 2.5% yield, which is pretty decent for a first-time tech payout. More importantly, the company’s language indicates that it’s keenly aware of the need to provide shareholder returns, saying they’ll consider a “range of options with additional capital allocation,” including share repurchases, special dividends and increases to the quarterly dividend, among others. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Oct. 1, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Jan. 31, 2025 Dividend Amount: $0.50 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 8.5% South Bow (SOBO) is typical of a new dividend payer in that it’s a spinoff. Specifically, this liquid pipelines business was spun off of Canadian energy infrastructure firm TC Energy (TRP). South Bow, whose name reflects its origins near Canada’s South Bow River, boasts more than 3,000 miles of oil and liquids pipeline infrastructure (most notably the Keystone Pipeline System) connecting Alberta crude oil supplies to U.S. refining markets in Illinois, Oklahoma, Texas, and the U.S. Gulf Coast. The company also owns storage terminals in the U.S. and Canada. Energy infrastructure stocks tend to be generous dividend payers, and South Bow is no exception. SOBO came out swinging at the bell—in the same release announcing its launch as an independent company, it also said it expected to declare its first dividend a month later (which it did). The company’s 50-cent quarterly dividend comes out to a yield north of 8%. For obvious reasons, there’s little price history here to study. But as is typical of an MLP, a high amount of its profits are contracted—in South Bow’s case, roughly 88% of comparable EBITDA, at an average remaining contract term of 8.3 years. In other words: Management doesn’t appear to be overreaching with its strong opening distribution. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images The monthly S&P 500 and NASDAQ composite cycles bottomed last week. There may be a minor pullback next month, but the overall uptrend is intact. Netflix is likely to be a leader in this rally. The stock has been strongest in the month of January. From January 21st through February 15th, price has risen over 85% of the time over the last 22 years. Daily, the stock is oversold. Weekly, we can see that relative strength has been rising since the spring of 2022. The monthly cycle has led price higher, and there is no cycle high until May. The stock is likely to rally over $900 in the next month and to new highs by April. 1-Netflix Daily This stock is very oversold and is due to rally. 2-Netflix Weekly Relative strength is expected to remain strong. 3-Netflix Monthly Cycle The NFLX monthly cycle points to higher prices. Fifth Third Bancorp also reports earnings this week and this report is also likely to be met with buying. Here is why. Daily, there are higher lows in momentum. The January through April time period has been bullish for these shares. In fact, from January 20 through February 16th, the stock has risen about 73% of the time. From the 21st through May 10th, the stock has risen 68% of the time. The third graph is that of the strong monthly price cycle. Thus, we see a combination of both the seasonal static cycle and the monthly dynamic cycle rising at the same time. FITB shares are likely to rally back to the prior $49 high. 1-First Third Bancorp Daily Momentum and relative strength point to better short-term performance. 2- First Third Bancorp Monthly Histogram Seasonality is at a low and strengthens into April. 3- First Third Bancorp Monthly Cycle The monthly price cycle heralds higher quotes.

Title: Mark Carney: The Wrongest Man at the Wrongest Time Ever
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/4291083/posts

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/19/2025 7:22:15 AM PST by MtnClimber Mark Carney’s bid for Canadian leadership pits a climate-activist banker against a political and economic tide increasingly rejecting the very ideals he champions. The politicization of business and capital markets has many fathers. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, one of the most prominent and unrelenting advocates for “sustainability” in investing, is often described as such. Klaus Schwab, the now-retired chairman and founder of the World Economic Forum, also often wears that title. So does the billionaire political gadfly Michael Bloomberg; so does R. Edward Freeman, the business professor and originator of “stakeholder theory;” and so do countless others who have worked diligently to advance ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance investing), DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion), and all the other efforts to make business and investing more “socially responsible” or less unfair or…whatever. Of all those responsible for this abuse of business and capital markets, perhaps no man is more singularly responsible—yet nearly totally overlooked by ESG’s critics—than Mark Carney. Carney is a banking and economic giant. He was the Governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008-2013 and the Governor of the Bank of England from 2013-2020. It was in this latter capacity that, in September 2016, Carney gave one of the most important and influential speeches in the history of central banking. Appearing at an event in Berlin, Carney gave a very carefully and very confrontationally worded address, in which he addressed climate change and framed its mitigation in fiscal and fiduciary terms. “A wholesale reassessment of prospects, as climate-related risks are re-evaluated,” Carney intoned, “could destabilise markets, spark a pro-cyclical crystallisation of losses and lead to a persistent tightening of financial conditions: a climate Minsky moment.” A “Minsky moment” is a market term named for the economist Hyman Minsky, which is used to identify the point at which a bull market has become so speculative and over-leveraged that it hits a peak and then tips over and crashes. What Carney meant by predicting a “climate-related” Minsky moment was that he—and others, presumably—believed that global capital markets were already overleveraged, already well overbought, given the inevitability of climate change. As a result, once investors started to understand the reality of the climate “crisis,” they would come to realize how foolish and speculative their investments in “unsustainable” businesses were, leading to a crash. Or to put it more simply, Carney—the Governor of the Bank of England—was warning global investors and politicians that they either had to force business in general to become environmentally sustainable immediately or could face commercial and economic Armageddon. It is nigh on impossible to describe just how destructive Carney’s speech and subsequent activism were. Not only did he make the case that climate change posed a real and imminent threat to global economic well-being, but he also provided ESG practitioners and advocates with the means to try to legitimize their social and political meddling. After all, here was a guy who had run two of the most important central banks in the world saying that “climate risk is investment risk,” thereby giving cover to those who wanted to use their economic might to affect political change but felt constrained by their ethical obligations to their investors and clients. Or, as I put in my book, The Dictatorship of Woke Capital, Carney’s speech was “a watershed in global finance, the moment that the big banks, the monster investment firms, and the world’s central banks began framing climate change as a risk management issue rather than good corporate social policy.” From that point on, the Larry Finks and Michael Bloombergs of the world could claim the moral high ground and could insist—contrary to the evidence—that what they were doing was legitimately in their clients’ interests and not in the service of their own political predilections. Carney went on to become one of “the usual suspects” in Western political activism, using any and every crisis to advance his ideological projects. He vehemently opposed Brexit and, indeed, eventually resigned his post at the Bank of England because the British people had the gall to defy him on that matter. He advised both the British and Canadian governments on COVID policy and, like many of his fellow “sustainability” advocates, used the pandemic to push more aggressively for a “new” form of capitalism, a new economic model that would be fairer, friendlier, and encompass “human values.” In 2020, after leaving the BofE, Carney became the United Nations envoy for climate action finance, which means that he ran around the world saying things like, “When you look at climate change from a human mortality perspective, it will be the equivalent of a coronavirus crisis every year from the middle of this century, and every year, not just a one-off event.” In 2022, Carney, along with his friend Michael Bloomberg, helped create GFANZ—the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero—an outgrowth of the UN’s COP26 meeting on climate change and one of the most powerful advocacy organizations pressing governments and businesses to abandon fossil fuels. The next year, Bloomberg appointed Carney chairman of the board of directors of Bloomberg L.P. In 2024, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formalized Carney’s advisory role with his government, naming him a special advisor and chairman of the task force on economic growth (something of which Canada has had very little for several years). And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. It is nigh on impossible to describe just how destructive Carney’s speech and subsequent activism were. Not only did he make the case that climate change posed a real and imminent threat to global economic well-being, but he also provided ESG practitioners and advocates with the means to try to legitimize their social and political meddling.

In 2024, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formalized Carney’s advisory role with his government, naming him a special advisor and chairman of the task force on economic growth (something of which Canada has had very little for several years). And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. This past Thursday, Mark Carney announced that he is running to replace Trudeau as the leader of the Liberal Party, the prelude to running for Prime Minister. Despite never having held political office before, he is certain he’s up to the challenge of running Canada whilst Donald Trump runs the United States. And he’s serious…which is kinda sad. Try as I might, I cannot think of anyone—save Justin Trudeau himself—whose politics and policies are less compatible with the zeitgeist in the West at the moment than Mark Carney. Throughout Western Europe, people are fed up with leaders who favor open borders, social justice politics, and the economics of decline (as dictated by Net Zero energy policies). Carney practically embodies all of the above. He is, in so many ways, the wrong man, in the wrong place, at the wrong time. And yet… One of two things will happen in eight weeks when the Liberal Party chooses its leader. Either Carney’s candidacy will fall flat, proving that he is too out of touch even for leftist Canadians, or it will succeed, proving that leftist Canadians desperately want to corroborate Mencken’s supposition that “democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.” If it’s the former, then perhaps Canada can resuscitate its near-depression-level economy and become a global energy leader again. If the latter, then…well…maybe President Trump has the right idea.

After all, here was a guy who had run two of the most important central banks in the world saying that “climate risk is investment risk,” thereby giving cover to those who wanted to use their economic might to affect political change but felt constrained by their ethical obligations to their investors and clients. Or, as I put in my book, The Dictatorship of Woke Capital, Carney’s speech was “a watershed in global finance, the moment that the big banks, the monster investment firms, and the world’s central banks began framing climate change as a risk management issue rather than good corporate social policy.” From that point on, the Larry Finks and Michael Bloombergs of the world could claim the moral high ground and could insist—contrary to the evidence—that what they were doing was legitimately in their clients’ interests and not in the service of their own political predilections. Carney went on to become one of “the usual suspects” in Western political activism, using any and every crisis to advance his ideological projects. He vehemently opposed Brexit and, indeed, eventually resigned his post at the Bank of England because the British people had the gall to defy him on that matter. He advised both the British and Canadian governments on COVID policy and, like many of his fellow “sustainability” advocates, used the pandemic to push more aggressively for a “new” form of capitalism, a new economic model that would be fairer, friendlier, and encompass “human values.” In 2020, after leaving the BofE, Carney became the United Nations envoy for climate action finance, which means that he ran around the world saying things like, “When you look at climate change from a human mortality perspective, it will be the equivalent of a coronavirus crisis every year from the middle of this century, and every year, not just a one-off event.” In 2022, Carney, along with his friend Michael Bloomberg, helped create GFANZ—the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero—an outgrowth of the UN’s COP26 meeting on climate change and one of the most powerful advocacy organizations pressing governments and businesses to abandon fossil fuels. The next year, Bloomberg appointed Carney chairman of the board of directors of Bloomberg L.P. In 2024, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formalized Carney’s advisory role with his government, naming him a special advisor and chairman of the task force on economic growth (something of which Canada has had very little for several years). And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. This past Thursday, Mark Carney announced that he is running to replace Trudeau as the leader of the Liberal Party, the prelude to running for Prime Minister. Despite never having held political office before, he is certain he’s up to the challenge of running Canada whilst Donald Trump runs the United States. And he’s serious…which is kinda sad. Try as I might, I cannot think of anyone—save Justin Trudeau himself—whose politics and policies are less compatible with the zeitgeist in the West at the moment than Mark Carney. Throughout Western Europe, people are fed up with leaders who favor open borders, social justice politics, and the economics of decline (as dictated by Net Zero energy policies). Carney practically embodies all of the above. He is, in so many ways, the wrong man, in the wrong place, at the wrong time. And yet… One of two things will happen in eight weeks when the Liberal Party chooses its leader. Either Carney’s candidacy will fall flat, proving that he is too out of touch even for leftist Canadians, or it will succeed, proving that leftist Canadians desperately want to corroborate Mencken’s supposition that “democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.” If it’s the former, then perhaps Canada can resuscitate its near-depression-level economy and become a global energy leader again. If the latter, then…well…maybe President Trump has the right idea.

Carney is a banking and economic giant. He was the Governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008-2013 and the Governor of the Bank of England from 2013-2020. It was in this latter capacity that, in September 2016, Carney gave one of the most important and influential speeches in the history of central banking. Appearing at an event in Berlin, Carney gave a very carefully and very confrontationally worded address, in which he addressed climate change and framed its mitigation in fiscal and fiduciary terms. “A wholesale reassessment of prospects, as climate-related risks are re-evaluated,” Carney intoned, “could destabilise markets, spark a pro-cyclical crystallisation of losses and lead to a persistent tightening of financial conditions: a climate Minsky moment.” A “Minsky moment” is a market term named for the economist Hyman Minsky, which is used to identify the point at which a bull market has become so speculative and over-leveraged that it hits a peak and then tips over and crashes. What Carney meant by predicting a “climate-related” Minsky moment was that he—and others, presumably—believed that global capital markets were already overleveraged, already well overbought, given the inevitability of climate change. As a result, once investors started to understand the reality of the climate “crisis,” they would come to realize how foolish and speculative their investments in “unsustainable” businesses were, leading to a crash. Or to put it more simply, Carney—the Governor of the Bank of England—was warning global investors and politicians that they either had to force business in general to become environmentally sustainable immediately or could face commercial and economic Armageddon. It is nigh on impossible to describe just how destructive Carney’s speech and subsequent activism were. Not only did he make the case that climate change posed a real and imminent threat to global economic well-being, but he also provided ESG practitioners and advocates with the means to try to legitimize their social and political meddling. After all, here was a guy who had run two of the most important central banks in the world saying that “climate risk is investment risk,” thereby giving cover to those who wanted to use their economic might to affect political change but felt constrained by their ethical obligations to their investors and clients.

He vehemently opposed Brexit and, indeed, eventually resigned his post at the Bank of England because the British people had the gall to defy him on that matter. He advised both the British and Canadian governments on COVID policy and, like many of his fellow “sustainability” advocates, used the pandemic to push more aggressively for a “new” form of capitalism, a new economic model that would be fairer, friendlier, and encompass “human values.” In 2020, after leaving the BofE, Carney became the United Nations envoy for climate action finance, which means that he ran around the world saying things like, “When you look at climate change from a human mortality perspective, it will be the equivalent of a coronavirus crisis every year from the middle of this century, and every year, not just a one-off event.” In 2022, Carney, along with his friend Michael Bloomberg, helped create GFANZ—the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero—an outgrowth of the UN’s COP26 meeting on climate change and one of the most powerful advocacy organizations pressing governments and businesses to abandon fossil fuels. The next year, Bloomberg appointed Carney chairman of the board of directors of Bloomberg L.P. In 2024, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formalized Carney’s advisory role with his government, naming him a special advisor and chairman of the task force on economic growth (something of which Canada has had very little for several years). And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. It is nigh on impossible to describe just how destructive Carney’s speech and subsequent activism were. Not only did he make the case that climate change posed a real and imminent threat to global economic well-being, but he also provided ESG practitioners and advocates with the means to try to legitimize their social and political meddling. After all, here was a guy who had run two of the most important central banks in the world saying that “climate risk is investment risk,” thereby giving cover to those who wanted to use their economic might to affect political change but felt constrained by their ethical obligations to their investors and clients. Or, as I put in my book, The Dictatorship of Woke Capital, Carney’s speech was “a watershed in global finance, the moment that the big banks, the monster investment firms, and the world’s central banks began framing climate change as a risk management issue rather than good corporate social policy.” From that point on, the Larry Finks and Michael Bloombergs of the world could claim the moral high ground and could insist—contrary to the evidence—that what they were doing was legitimately in their clients’ interests and not in the service of their own political predilections.

And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. This past Thursday, Mark Carney announced that he is running to replace Trudeau as the leader of the Liberal Party, the prelude to running for Prime Minister. Despite never having held political office before, he is certain he’s up to the challenge of running Canada whilst Donald Trump runs the United States. And he’s serious…which is kinda sad. Try as I might, I cannot think of anyone—save Justin Trudeau himself—whose politics and policies are less compatible with the zeitgeist in the West at the moment than Mark Carney. Throughout Western Europe, people are fed up with leaders who favor open borders, social justice politics, and the economics of decline (as dictated by Net Zero energy policies). Carney practically embodies all of the above. He is, in so many ways, the wrong man, in the wrong place, at the wrong time. And yet… One of two things will happen in eight weeks when the Liberal Party chooses its leader. Either Carney’s candidacy will fall flat, proving that he is too out of touch even for leftist Canadians, or it will succeed, proving that leftist Canadians desperately want to corroborate Mencken’s supposition that “democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.” If it’s the former, then perhaps Canada can resuscitate its near-depression-level economy and become a global energy leader again. If the latter, then…well…maybe President Trump has the right idea.

The next year, Bloomberg appointed Carney chairman of the board of directors of Bloomberg L.P. In 2024, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formalized Carney’s advisory role with his government, naming him a special advisor and chairman of the task force on economic growth (something of which Canada has had very little for several years). And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. This past Thursday, Mark Carney announced that he is running to replace Trudeau as the leader of the Liberal Party, the prelude to running for Prime Minister. Despite never having held political office before, he is certain he’s up to the challenge of running Canada whilst Donald Trump runs the United States. And he’s serious…which is kinda sad. Try as I might, I cannot think of anyone—save Justin Trudeau himself—whose politics and policies are less compatible with the zeitgeist in the West at the moment than Mark Carney.

And yet… One of two things will happen in eight weeks when the Liberal Party chooses its leader. Either Carney’s candidacy will fall flat, proving that he is too out of touch even for leftist Canadians, or it will succeed, proving that leftist Canadians desperately want to corroborate Mencken’s supposition that “democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.” If it’s the former, then perhaps Canada can resuscitate its near-depression-level economy and become a global energy leader again.

Title: TikTok stops working for US users as ban takes effect
URL: https://7news.com.au/technology/social-media/tiktok-stops-working-for-us-users-as-ban-takes-effect-c-17433404
Time Published: 2025-01-19T15:09:36Z
Full Content:
Local news: TikTok has gone dark in the US ahead of a federal ban on the Chinese-owned short-video app, cutting off access to the platform that has captivated nearly half of all Americans, fueled small businesses and shaped online culture. By 10.50pm on Saturday US Eastern Standard Time, the app was not found on Apple and Google’s app stores, which are prohibited from offering the platform under a law that required TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell the platform or face a US ban. “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US,” a message on the app said. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today “Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now. “We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned,” the message said. Earlier US President-elect Donald Trump said he would “most likely” give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from a potential ban after he takes office, as the app with 170 million American users buzzed with nervous anticipation ahead of the shutdown. “The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it’s appropriate,” Trump told NBC. “If I decide to do that, I’ll probably announce it on Monday.” Users logging on late on Saturday were met with a message that said the law would “force us to make our services temporarily unavailable. We’re working to restore our service in the US as soon as possible”. The Chinese-owned app, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, said on Friday it will go dark in the US on Sunday unless President Joe Biden’s administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security. The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown on Sunday. “We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. “China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” a spokesperson said. In the lead up, TikTok and its aficionados geared up for goodbye. Some on the app filmed themselves frantically scrolling or sharing final secrets with their followers ahead of the ban. Leaders at Oracle, the main cloud computing provider for TikTok’s US operations, told staff to prepare to shut down servers that host US TikTok data as soon as 9pm ET on Saturday (1pm AEDT on Sunday) in advance of ban from Sunday, The Information reported. Without a decision by Biden to formally invoke a 90-day delay in the deadline, companies providing services to TikTok or hosting the app could face enormous financial liability. Experts said Trump could also direct his Justice Department to “deprioritise” or not enforce the law but it is not clear if that will provide enough legal protection to app store owners Apple and Google providing crucial services for TikTok. Trump tried to ban and force the divestment of TikTok in 2020 but was blocked by US courts. Uncertainty over the app’s future had sent users - mostly younger people - scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote. Rivals Meta and Snap had also seen their shares rise this month ahead of the ban, as investors bet on an influx of users and advertising dollars. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans this week in what one executive described as a “hair on fire” moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialise to keep the app running. There have been signs TikTok could make a comeback under Trump, who has said he wants to pursue a “political resolution” of the issue and last month urged the Supreme Court to pause implementation of the ban. US search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok US, a source familiar with the company’s plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok US and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60 per cent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 per cent each. with AP Stream free on 2 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 2 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read Stay informed with the free 7NEWS app. Available on iOS & Android.

Title: 1 Stock to Buy, 1 Stock to Sell This Week: Netflix, Procter & Gamble

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. • Trump inauguration, Q4 earnings season will be in focus in the holiday-shortened week ahead. • With its transformative business model and clear growth trajectory, Netflix looks like a compelling buy for investors seeking quality growth. • Procter & Gamble faces operational challenges and tepid growth, making it less appealing in the current market environment. • Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro! U.S. stocks rallied on Friday ahead of the inauguration of Donald Trump, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 had their best week since the November election amid signs of easing inflation. For the week, the Dow and S&P 500 advanced 3.7% and 2.9%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.5%. Source: Investing.com The week ahead is expected to be another eventful one as investors continue to gauge the outlook for the economy and interest rates. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday. President-elect Trump’s inauguration also will be Monday, with the incoming president expected to issue a flurry of day one executive orders. Source: Investing.com Meanwhile, the fourth quarter earnings season shifts into high gear, with reports expected from several high-profile companies, including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), American Express (NYSE:AXP), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will also be closely watched. Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 20 - Friday, January 24. For investors looking to allocate capital this week, Netflix stands out as a strong growth opportunity. The streaming giant’s shift to advertising, live events, and monetization of popular content like ‘Squid Game’ are significant tailwinds that could propel the stock higher in the week ahead. The Los Gatos, California-based Internet television network is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter update after the U.S. market closes on Tuesday at 4:00PM ET. A call with co-CEO’s Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters is set for 5:00PM ET. Market participants expect a sizable swing in NFLX stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of nearly 9% in either direction. The stock rose 8.8% after the last earnings report came out in mid-October. Source: InvestingPro Profit estimates have been revised upward 27 times in the last 90 days, reflecting growing confidence among analysts. Only four downward revisions have been noted, underscoring Wall Street’s bullish sentiment toward the entertainment powerhouse. Netflix is seen earning $4.21 per share, representing a staggering 99% increase from the prior year. Meanwhile, revenue is forecast to increase 15% year-over-year to $10.1 billion. The company has shifted its focus from pure subscriber growth to prioritizing operating margins and revenue expansion. This pivot includes a robust advertising model, which is becoming a cornerstone of its growth strategy. On the content front, the blockbuster release of ‘Squid Game Season 2’ and other high-profile projects ensures a steady stream of engagement. Netflix is also venturing into live events, including NFL games and boxing matches, expanding its appeal to a broader audience. NFLX stock ended at $858.10 last Friday. At current levels, Netflix has a market cap of $366.8 billion. Shares are down 3.7% to start 2025 after scoring an annual gain of 83% last year. Source: Investing.com It is worth mentioning that Netflix has a great InvestingPro Financial Health Score of 3.1/5.0, reflecting its strong financials, robust growth prospects, and innovative strategies.

On the other hand, Procter & Gamble faces operational challenges and tepid growth, making it less attractive in the current market environment. The global consumer products company is scheduled to report its fiscal second quarter earnings report before the stock market opens on Wednesday at 6:55AM ET. The expected move in the options market is about 3.4% up or down. Shares fell 1.6% after the last earnings report came out in October. Underscoring several challenges facing Procter & Gamble, 18 out of the 19 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro cut their sales estimates ahead of the print, citing soft consumer demand and a challenging outlook. Source: InvestingPro P&G is seen earning $1.86 per share, increasing just 1.1% from EPS of $1.84 in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, revenue is forecast to inch up 2.2% year-over-year to $21.6 billion. These modest growth projections reflect increasing challenges for the company. The consumer goods giant recently faced operational disruptions, including a ransomware attack on one of its shipping vendors. The attack could weigh on distribution efficiency and hurt margins in the short term. Moreover, rising competition in key markets and inflationary pressures on raw materials are expected to limit profitability. As such, CEO Jon Moeller may strike a cautious tone and give soft guidance to reflect supply chain disruptions and weakening margins. PG stock closed last Friday’s session at $161.13, not far from its lowest level since April 2024. At its current valuation, the Cincinnati-based consumer goods company has a market cap of $379.5 billion. Shares are down 3.8% to start the new year. Source: Investing.com Although P&G remains a dominant player in the consumer goods sector with strong brands like Tide and Gillette, its growth is slowing, and the stock appears fully valued. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.7, the shares may not offer much upside at current levels.

Title: Davos has a Marie Antoinette problem

There’s no proof that Marie Antoinette ever said “let them eat cake”. But, according to historians, it was the sort of thing she might have said. Hence, it rang true or at least chimed with the antiroyalist sentiment pervading France at the time. The Bourbons were the quintessential out-of-touch establishment and her reportedly cavalier dismissal of food shortages confirmed the notion that the country’s ruling elite had no idea how their subjects lived and could not even comprehend how some people could not afford to eat. As a smear job, if that was the intention, it succeeded. Two centuries later France’s ill-fated queen is still a byword for aristocratic extravagance. Davos – shorthand for the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual event in the Swiss ski resort of the same name – has something of a Marie Antoinette problem of its own. While it bills itself as a progressive conference hosted by a think tank “committed to improving the state of the world”, it comes across to the wider public as a giant schmoozefest for establishment elites, a franking of the current world order rather than a challenge to it. One comedian calls it “the money Oscars”. The image of political and business leaders moving seamlessly from worthy pronouncements on inequality to champagne and caviar bumps at one of the many corporate-sponsored cocktail parties doesn’t help. The glitzy backdrop invites a steady stream of cynicism that the event can’t seem to shake. In recent years, political leaders have shunned the Davos party circuit for fear of contamination. It’s not a good look to be seen quaffing vintage wines when your economy back home is turning to mush (the last three meetings have taken place against a backdrop of pandemics, wars and energy price shocks). As the biggest meeting of business and politics globally, Davos is the showpiece event for globalisation and traditionally a target of leftwing protest. But more recently it has also become a bugbear of the right, the global version of Trump’s Washington swamp. Last year, Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, the most influential conservative think tank in the US, told a panel discussion that Davos and its well-heeled attendees were essentially “part of the problem”. “It’s laughable that you – or anyone – would dare to describe Davos as protecting liberal democracy,” he said. It is ironic then that this year’s event kicks off on the same day as Trump’s inauguration in the US. Trump’s election triumph in the world’s largest economy and in a country that, more than any other, has driven the globalisation agenda, is a scalding repudiation of globalisation and a check on the Davos consensus. Trump will address the four-day conference via a live video link on Thursday in what organisers say will be a “virtual engagement with participants”. This year’s event was always going to be dominated by the fallout from Trump’s second term. Davos attendees, like most liberals, have a love-hate relationship with Trump: they officially despise him and yet his address will be the hottest ticket in town. “There is a lot of interest to decipher and to understand the policies of the new administration, so it will be an interesting week,” WEF president and chief executive Borge Brende said last week. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Uber’s Dara Khosrowshahi have prioritised Trump’s inauguration over Davos, reflecting Silicon Valley’s embracing of the Maga firebrand. But JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, who was apparently communicating with Trump about economic policy during the election campaign and, at one point, was even floated as a possible US treasury secretary – will be there. Other bank chiefs including Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon are also expected while BlackRock is sending a high-level delegation. [ Davos clamps down on gatecrashersOpens in new window ] The annual meeting will attract more than 3,000 business and political leaders, including 900 company chairs and chief executives along with 60 heads of state and government. Official Ireland’s attendance will be lighter than usual because of the busy political schedule at home. While Taoiseach Simon Harris is on the official list of attendees, Wednesday’s Dáil vote will preclude him from attending. Up to 50 top executives are, however, expected to attend the IDA-hosted dinner in the Grischa hotel on Wednesday evening (last year former taoiseach Leo Varadkar sat beside Altman). This year’s Davos convenes under the theme Collaboration for the Intelligent Age, an aspirational notion amid so much political discord and with new technologies increasingly being used to amplify disinformation rather than reasoned debate. The titles of discussion panels at the event will evoke the unsettling new landscape. “Diplomacy amid disorder”; “Russia, what next?” ; “Truth versus myth in elections” and the “Rise of economic nationalism” gives you a flavour. A central question is whether leaders can agree on the root causes of this populist backlash and articulate a credible response.

Title: TikTok goes dark for US users; Trump signals intervention
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tiktok-goes-dark-for-us-users-trump-says-save-tiktok-3820071
Time Published: 2025-01-19T13:40:37Z

By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -TikTok began restoring its services on Sunday after President-elect Donald Trump said he would revive the app's access in the U.S. when he returns to power on Monday. "Frankly, we have no choice. We have to save it," Trump said at a rally on Sunday ahead of his inauguration, adding that the U.S. will seek a joint venture to restore the short-video sharing app used by 170 million Americans. In a message to users hours before the rally, TikTok said: "As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S." TikTok issued an earlier statement after U.S. users reported being able to access the Chinese-owned service's website while the far more widely used TikTok app itself began coming back online for some users with just a few basic services. Late on Sunday, the app was unavailable for download on U.S. app stores. "In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service," TikTok said in the earlier statement that also thanked Trump for "providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties (for) providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive." TikTok's public thanks to Trump, the day before he takes office, comes at a tense moment in U.S.-China relations. Trump has said he intends to place tariffs on China but has also indicated he hopes to have more direct contact with China's leader. When asked about the app's restoration and Trump's desire for a deal, China's foreign ministry told a regular news briefing on Monday that it believed companies should "decide independently" about their operations and deals. "TikTok has operated in the U.S. for many years and is deeply loved by American users," ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. "We hope that the U.S. can earnestly listen to the voice of reason and provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for firms operating there." TikTok stopped working for U.S. users late on Saturday before a law shutting it down on national security grounds took effect on Sunday. U.S. officials had said that under Chinese parent company ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused. Trump said he would "extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security." "I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture," he wrote on his Truth Social platform. Trump said the executive order would specify there would be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before his order. Trump had earlier said he would most likely give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned," a message notified users of TikTok, which disappeared from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) app stores late on Saturday. Trump saving TikTok represents a reversal in stance from his first term in office. In 2020, he aimed to ban the app over concerns the company was sharing Americans' personal info with the Chinese government. More recently, Trump has said he has "a warm spot in my heart for TikTok," crediting the app with helping him win over young voters in the 2024 presidential election. In August 2020, Trump signed an executive order giving ByteDance 90 days to sell TikTok but then blessed a deal structured as a partnership rather than a divestment that would have included both Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) taking stakes in the new company. Not everyone in Trump's Republican Party agreed with efforts to get around the law and "Save TikTok". Republican senators Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said in a joint statement: "Now that the law has taken effect, there is no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date. For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law's qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China." The U.S. has never banned a major social media platform. The law passed overwhelmingly by Congress gives the incoming Trump administration sweeping authority to ban or seek the sale of other Chinese-owned apps. Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app CapCut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S. app stores as of late Saturday. Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 'HAIR ON FIRE' MOMENT Web searches for "VPN" spiked in the minutes after U.S. users lost access to TikTok, according to Google Trends. Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform's e-commerce arm. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans in what one executive described as a "hair on fire" moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialize to keep the app running. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the U.S. presidential inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told Reuters. Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has also held talks about selling TikTok's U.S. operations to billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that. U.S. search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok U.S., a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok U.S. and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the U.S..

To me, this one event is the closest I will get to being like Michael Jordan in the playoffs — and I am very lucky to be in attendance. And this year, the gathering of the elites flying in on private jets to wax poetic on the world's biggest problems will be extra nutty. Read more: Here are the biggest global risks for 2025 The conference unofficially kicks off on Trump's Inauguration Day. Some CEOs I know who normally would be at Davos all week are dropping in mid-week after working the inauguration party rounds. By Tuesday, the newly minted president may have uncorked a host of executive orders that could impact the businesses of the top CEOs on the ground. And, of course, impact the global markets. This is why this year's WEF will be more important than the norm for you, the average investor. The headlines will be coming in hot and heavy as CEOs look to challenge Trump or get on his good side. They will also look to talk up their businesses ahead of the start of earnings season, and with markets getting a little rockier of late. Here's what yours truly and our very own Jennifer Schonberger will be watching while bundled up in five layers all week. Be sure to bookmark the "streaming now" section on Yahoo Finance to catch all our market-moving interviews in real time. Or tune in where you normally catch us, whether that's on Samsung TV or our nifty app. Unlike our previous trips to Davos over the past decade, I will be taping several special episodes of the Opening Bid podcast on the ground. I could tell you who those guests will be, but where is the fun in that? Best to be surprised! Now, on to that guide... Big bank CEOs: The biggest names in banking, such as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Citi (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick will be in attendance. While this group will all get asked about Trump policies, it's going to be their outlook on interest rates that will be most key to market sentiment. Most have not spoken publicly since the Fed signaled a likely halt in rate cuts last month, and they will want to be heard ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting. The tariff CEOs: Retail will have a nice showing at Davos, with the CEOs of Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Williams Sonoma (WSM), and Gap (GAP) (their CEO's first time at the event) making the rounds. These companies are right in the middle of the tariff debate. I'll be interested in how they are preparing for Trump tariffs from a supply chain perspective. I am also interested in how much they could raise prices post-tariffs — it could offer valuable insight into the 2025 inflation outlook and Fed policy. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? The race to catch Nvidia: It will be another year of artificial intelligence chatter throughout the halls of Davos. This time, I think the discussions will take two forms. First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it. And two, we will probably hear more about how Big Tech players in Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are aiming to develop their own high-powered AI chips to catch Nvidia (NVDA), or at least make good enough chips to diversify. Leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic will also be in attendance, and their thoughts on chips could be key. I'll be watching Nvidia's stock price like a hawk this week, and you should be as well. Crypto delegation: The crypto industry has had a solid presence at Davos in the past five years. This year, the industry is expected to be out in force, headlined by an appearance from Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong. I'll be quite attuned to what the crypto crowd thinks about the latest volatility in bitcoin, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin buying binge, what they are hearing from the pro-crypto Trump administration, and early assessments on Paul Atkins as the likely next SEC chairman. And of course, the new Trump coin that debuted to much fanfare (and market cap) on Friday. The token quickly rose to a market cap of $73 billion in about 48 hours, surpassing DOGE as the largest meme coin so far. The market cap of the crypto has since dropped to $12 billion from its launch, according to CoinMarketCap. Stocks: Stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), as I have reported. I'm eager to hear from market pros such as JPMorgan's Mary Erdoes and economic experts like Nouriel Roubini on whether they are seeing red flags on the horizon. Any calls they make at this Davos may hold greater weight given more volatile market conditions and increased Trump policy uncertainty. The political wild cards: As of this writing, contacts have told me President-elect Donald Trump plans to send delegates to Davos. Who precisely gets the nod is the wild card. (I fancy it will be potential Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a Davos party scene regular for many years. Elon has long hated Davos, so hard to see him appearing). Trump himself is slated to give a speech remotely on Thursday, a source told Yahoo Finance. But who ultimately shows up from Trump's orbit — and what they say once touching down — could set the tone on US international relations right out of the gate. If a delegate arrives at Davos days after Trump takes actions that could weigh on the economic growth of foreign countries and then aims to explain the actions, best believe the inevitable headlines may not be so market-friendly. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Coverage of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, each year is something I view as a competitive sport. I actually start training for the intense week over the summer, as my few close friends know (and yes, they all make fun of me). The number of workouts every week in the lead-up rises incrementally so I can easily sprint up and down the two-mile promenade with a backpack to stuff in as many meetings as humanly possible (yes, I do this). My one cheat meal a week gets replaced by green drinks and extra doses of vitamins to ensure I don't get sick. I meditate twice a day and carefully pick out clothes I know will help me execute at the highest level. Look good, feel good, good things happen. To me, this one event is the closest I will get to being like Michael Jordan in the playoffs — and I am very lucky to be in attendance. And this year, the gathering of the elites flying in on private jets to wax poetic on the world's biggest problems will be extra nutty. Read more: Here are the biggest global risks for 2025 The conference unofficially kicks off on Trump's Inauguration Day. Some CEOs I know who normally would be at Davos all week are dropping in mid-week after working the inauguration party rounds. By Tuesday, the newly minted president may have uncorked a host of executive orders that could impact the businesses of the top CEOs on the ground. And, of course, impact the global markets. This is why this year's WEF will be more important than the norm for you, the average investor. The headlines will be coming in hot and heavy as CEOs look to challenge Trump or get on his good side. They will also look to talk up their businesses ahead of the start of earnings season, and with markets getting a little rockier of late. Here's what yours truly and our very own Jennifer Schonberger will be watching while bundled up in five layers all week. Be sure to bookmark the "streaming now" section on Yahoo Finance to catch all our market-moving interviews in real time. Or tune in where you normally catch us, whether that's on Samsung TV or our nifty app. Unlike our previous trips to Davos over the past decade, I will be taping several special episodes of the Opening Bid podcast on the ground. I could tell you who those guests will be, but where is the fun in that? Best to be surprised! Now, on to that guide... Big bank CEOs: The biggest names in banking, such as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Citi (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick will be in attendance. While this group will all get asked about Trump policies, it's going to be their outlook on interest rates that will be most key to market sentiment. Most have not spoken publicly since the Fed signaled a likely halt in rate cuts last month, and they will want to be heard ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting. The tariff CEOs: Retail will have a nice showing at Davos, with the CEOs of Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Williams Sonoma (WSM), and Gap (GAP) (their CEO's first time at the event) making the rounds. These companies are right in the middle of the tariff debate. I'll be interested in how they are preparing for Trump tariffs from a supply chain perspective. I am also interested in how much they could raise prices post-tariffs — it could offer valuable insight into the 2025 inflation outlook and Fed policy. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? The race to catch Nvidia: It will be another year of artificial intelligence chatter throughout the halls of Davos. This time, I think the discussions will take two forms. First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it. And two, we will probably hear more about how Big Tech players in Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are aiming to develop their own high-powered AI chips to catch Nvidia (NVDA), or at least make good enough chips to diversify. Leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic will also be in attendance, and their thoughts on chips could be key. I'll be watching Nvidia's stock price like a hawk this week, and you should be as well. Crypto delegation: The crypto industry has had a solid presence at Davos in the past five years. This year, the industry is expected to be out in force, headlined by an appearance from Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong. I'll be quite attuned to what the crypto crowd thinks about the latest volatility in bitcoin, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin buying binge, what they are hearing from the pro-crypto Trump administration, and early assessments on Paul Atkins as the likely next SEC chairman. And of course, the new Trump coin that debuted to much fanfare (and market cap) on Friday. The token quickly rose to a market cap of $73 billion in about 48 hours, surpassing DOGE as the largest meme coin so far. The market cap of the crypto has since dropped to $12 billion from its launch, according to CoinMarketCap. Stocks: Stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), as I have reported. I'm eager to hear from market pros such as JPMorgan's Mary Erdoes and economic experts like Nouriel Roubini on whether they are seeing red flags on the horizon. Any calls they make at this Davos may hold greater weight given more volatile market conditions and increased Trump policy uncertainty. The political wild cards: As of this writing, contacts have told me President-elect Donald Trump plans to send delegates to Davos. Who precisely gets the nod is the wild card. (I fancy it will be potential Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a Davos party scene regular for many years. Elon has long hated Davos, so hard to see him appearing). Trump himself is slated to give a speech remotely on Thursday, a source told Yahoo Finance. But who ultimately shows up from Trump's orbit — and what they say once touching down — could set the tone on US international relations right out of the gate. If a delegate arrives at Davos days after Trump takes actions that could weigh on the economic growth of foreign countries and then aims to explain the actions, best believe the inevitable headlines may not be so market-friendly. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it. And two, we will probably hear more about how Big Tech players in Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are aiming to develop their own high-powered AI chips to catch Nvidia (NVDA), or at least make good enough chips to diversify. Leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic will also be in attendance, and their thoughts on chips could be key. I'll be watching Nvidia's stock price like a hawk this week, and you should be as well. Crypto delegation: The crypto industry has had a solid presence at Davos in the past five years. This year, the industry is expected to be out in force, headlined by an appearance from Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong. I'll be quite attuned to what the crypto crowd thinks about the latest volatility in bitcoin, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin buying binge, what they are hearing from the pro-crypto Trump administration, and early assessments on Paul Atkins as the likely next SEC chairman. And of course, the new Trump coin that debuted to much fanfare (and market cap) on Friday. The token quickly rose to a market cap of $73 billion in about 48 hours, surpassing DOGE as the largest meme coin so far. The market cap of the crypto has since dropped to $12 billion from its launch, according to CoinMarketCap. Stocks: Stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), as I have reported. I'm eager to hear from market pros such as JPMorgan's Mary Erdoes and economic experts like Nouriel Roubini on whether they are seeing red flags on the horizon. Any calls they make at this Davos may hold greater weight given more volatile market conditions and increased Trump policy uncertainty. The political wild cards: As of this writing, contacts have told me President-elect Donald Trump plans to send delegates to Davos. Who precisely gets the nod is the wild card. (I fancy it will be potential Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a Davos party scene regular for many years. Elon has long hated Davos, so hard to see him appearing). Trump himself is slated to give a speech remotely on Thursday, a source told Yahoo Finance. But who ultimately shows up from Trump's orbit — and what they say once touching down — could set the tone on US international relations right out of the gate. If a delegate arrives at Davos days after Trump takes actions that could weigh on the economic growth of foreign countries and then aims to explain the actions, best believe the inevitable headlines may not be so market-friendly. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Coverage of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, each year is something I view as a competitive sport. I actually start training for the intense week over the summer, as my few close friends know (and yes, they all make fun of me). The number of workouts every week in the lead-up rises incrementally so I can easily sprint up and down the two-mile promenade with a backpack to stuff in as many meetings as humanly possible (yes, I do this). My one cheat meal a week gets replaced by green drinks and extra doses of vitamins to ensure I don't get sick. I meditate twice a day and carefully pick out clothes I know will help me execute at the highest level. Look good, feel good, good things happen. To me, this one event is the closest I will get to being like Michael Jordan in the playoffs — and I am very lucky to be in attendance. And this year, the gathering of the elites flying in on private jets to wax poetic on the world's biggest problems will be extra nutty. Read more: Here are the biggest global risks for 2025 The conference unofficially kicks off on Trump's Inauguration Day. Some CEOs I know who normally would be at Davos all week are dropping in mid-week after working the inauguration party rounds. By Tuesday, the newly minted president may have uncorked a host of executive orders that could impact the businesses of the top CEOs on the ground. And, of course, impact the global markets. This is why this year's WEF will be more important than the norm for you, the average investor. The headlines will be coming in hot and heavy as CEOs look to challenge Trump or get on his good side. They will also look to talk up their businesses ahead of the start of earnings season, and with markets getting a little rockier of late. Here's what yours truly and our very own Jennifer Schonberger will be watching while bundled up in five layers all week. Be sure to bookmark the "streaming now" section on Yahoo Finance to catch all our market-moving interviews in real-time. Or tune in where you normally catch us, whether that's on Samsung TV or our nifty app. Unlike our previous trips to Davos over the past decade, I will be taping several special episodes of the Opening Bid podcast on the ground. I could tell you who those guests will be, but where is the fun in that? Best to be surprised! Now, on to that guide... Big bank CEOs: The biggest names in banking, such as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Citi (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick will be in attendance. While this group will all get asked about Trump policies, it's going to be their outlook on interest rates that will be most key to market sentiment. Most have not spoken publicly since the Fed signaled a likely halt in rate cuts last month, and they will want to be heard ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting. The tariff CEOs: Retail will have a nice showing at Davos, with the CEOs of Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Williams Sonoma (WSM), and Gap (GAP) (their CEO's first time at the event) making the rounds. These companies are right in the middle of the tariff debate. I'll be interested in how they are preparing for Trump tariffs from a supply chain perspective. I am also interested in how much they could raise prices post-tariffs — it could offer up valuable insight into the 2025 inflation outlook and Fed policy. The race to catch Nvidia: It will be another year of AI chatter throughout the halls of Davos. This time, I think the discussions will take two forms. First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it.

We recently compiled a list of the Louis Navellier's Top 15 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks. Louis Navellier is a prominent American investor, author, and financial analyst, best known for his quantitative approach to stock selection and his long-standing track record in the investment industry. As the founder and chairman of Navellier & Associates, a private investment management firm, he has built a reputation for identifying high-growth stocks with significant upside potential. Navellier’s approach blends rigorous quantitative analysis with a focus on fundamental factors, positioning him as a leading voice in growth investing. Born in 1957, Navellier developed an early interest in the stock market. He honed his analytical skills while studying at California State University, where he earned a Bachelor’s degree in Finance. It was during his college years that Navellier discovered his passion for quantitative analysis, developing a stock-picking system as part of a class project. This project laid the foundation for his career, as he created a system to identify market-beating stocks using specific growth and valuation criteria.

Over the years, the firm has managed billions of dollars in assets, applying Navellier’s quantitative methodology to identify outperforming stocks. Navellier is also widely known for publishing the Navellier Growth newsletter, where he shares stock recommendations and insights into market trends. In his newsletter-based recommendations, many stocks have achieved annualized returns exceeding 20% during high-growth market periods. Navellier’s approach focuses on finding stocks that exhibit strong growth characteristics while maintaining sound fundamentals. He relies heavily on quantitative analysis, utilizing algorithms and statistical models to screen for stocks with high revenue and earnings growth, solid profit margins, and favorable valuation metrics. Unlike many value investors who prioritize underpriced securities, Navellier embraces growth investing, emphasizing companies with strong momentum and the potential for rapid expansion. This strategy often leads him to sectors like technology, healthcare, and consumer goods.

Only the companies that have been in the 13F portfolio of the fund consistently for the past three years were selected. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds.

Title: Stocks Await More Earnings After Strong Start And Better Inflation

Last week, better bank earnings and friendly details within inflation data, sent stocks and bonds ... [+] higher. This week the focus will be on more fourth-quarter earnings and politics, with the Trump administration taking power and likely to begin making policy changes. Within the S&P 500, 20 companies reported earnings last week, dominated by large bank earnings. Seventy-nine percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 40 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season Better bank earnings and friendly inflation readings sent bond yields lower and stocks higher. The S&P 500 rose 2.9% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 gained 2.0%. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). Notably, bank stocks soared 8.2% on the back of better earnings. Market Performance While headline consumer inflation (CPI) rose to 2.9% year-over-year, there was better news beneath the surface. The rate of services inflation continued to decelerate. If this easing in services prices continues, combined with the likely deceleration in housing costs, the headline inflation rate should begin to moderate again. Headline & Services Inflation Until relief came last week, rising bond yields had begun to weigh on stock prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had approached 4.8% on January 14 after being as low as 3.6% in mid-September 2024. Interestingly, the rise in yields has been primarily due to the increase in real (after-inflation expectations) yield rather than increasing inflation expectations. The better details within last week’s inflation reading sent the 10-year Treasury yield down to 4.6%. 10-Year Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Banks make up a sizable portion of this week's earnings reporters, but other companies reporting are 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The financial sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 47.5% from 39.3%. Generally speaking, loan growth remained modest for the banks in the fourth quarter, but capital markets activity significantly boosted earnings. Bank Loans: Year-Over-Year Change The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by the powerful technology and communications services duo. Bringing up the rear is the energy sector, with a forecasted almost 30% decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are again the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow by 21.7% year-over-year versus 9.7% for the rest of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 earnings aren’t scheduled to begin until the week of January 27. Magnificent 7: Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth The significant decline in oil prices year-over-year should result in the expected earnings decline for the energy sector and weigh on materials. Energy Commodities Price Change The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter will likely depress international earnings growth at the margin. U.S. Dollar Strengthens Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.7% has slightly exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from an estimated 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. GDP & S&P 500 Sales Growth Sales growth is expected to be the most robust in the technology sector, with the energy sector predicted to show a decline in year-over-year revenue due to lower oil prices. 4Q 2024 Estimates Sales Growth By Sector Primarily due to the robust earnings growth for the banks, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +12.5% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary With few meaningful economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday could unleash a wave of policy announcements, which could lead to some volatility in the impacted sectors. While the banks provided a solid start to the earnings season, this week’s reporters should give a glimpse into additional sectors and a strong dose of additional banks. Forward earnings guidance for 2025 will be watched closely as double-digit profit growth expectations are baked into consensus estimates.

Last week, better bank earnings and friendly details within inflation data, sent stocks and bonds ... [+] higher. This week the focus will be on more fourth-quarter earnings and politics, with the Trump administration taking power and likely to begin making policy changes. Within the S&P 500, 20 companies reported earnings last week, dominated by large bank earnings. Seventy-nine percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 40 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season Better bank earnings and friendly inflation readings sent bond yields lower and stocks higher. The S&P 500 rose 2.9% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 gained 2.0%. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). Notably, bank stocks soared 8.2% on the back of better earnings. Market Performance While headline consumer inflation (CPI) rose to 2.9% year-over-year, there was better news beneath the surface. The rate of services inflation continued to decelerate. If this easing in services prices continues, combined with the likely deceleration in housing costs, the headline inflation rate should begin to moderate again. Headline & Services Inflation Until relief came last week, rising bond yields had begun to weigh on stock prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had approached 4.8% on January 14 after being as low as 3.6% in mid-September 2024. Interestingly, the rise in yields has been primarily due to the increase in real (after-inflation expectations) yield rather than increasing inflation expectations. The better details within last week’s inflation reading sent the 10-year Treasury yield down to 4.6%. 10-Year Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Banks make up a sizable portion of this week's earnings reporters, but other companies reporting are 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The financial sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 47.5% from 39.3%. Generally speaking, loan growth remained modest for the banks in the fourth quarter, but capital markets activity significantly boosted earnings. Bank Loans: Year-Over-Year Change The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by the powerful technology and communications services duo. Bringing up the rear is the energy sector, with a forecasted almost 30% decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are again the group to watch this earnings season.

Title: Why Hundreds of Companies Will Buy Bitcoin in 2025

Time Published: 2025-01-19T11:00:00Z

EditorCrypto bitcoin, Bitcoin Magazine, Mark Mason Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicts a treasury revolution, forecasting hundreds of companies to buy Bitcoin as a reserve asset within 18 months, shaping a transformative ‘overlooked megatrend’. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at Bitwise, has issued a bold prediction: hundreds of companies will buy Bitcoin as a treasury asset over the next 12 to 18 months. The shift, which Hougan describes as an “overlooked megatrend,” has the potential to significantly influence Bitcoin’s market trajectory. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin adoption. Though ranked only 220th globally by market capitalization, the company’s influence on the Bitcoin market is disproportionate. In 2024 alone, MicroStrategy acquired 257,000 BTC—exceeding the total Bitcoin mined that year (218,829 BTC). The company’s ambitions show no signs of slowing. It recently announced plans to raise $42 billion for additional Bitcoin purchases, equivalent to 2.6 years’ worth of Bitcoin’s annual production at current rates. MicroStrategy’s actions are just the tip of the iceberg. According to Hougan, 70 publicly traded companies already hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. This list includes not only crypto-native firms like Coinbase and Marathon Digital but also mainstream giants like Tesla, Block, and Mercado Libre. Together, these firms—excluding MicroStrategy—own 141,302 BTC. Private companies are also significant players. SpaceX, Block.one, and others collectively hold at least 368,043 BTC, based on data from BitcoinTreasuries.com. Hougan highlights that MicroStrategy’s share of the corporate Bitcoin market is already less than 50% and is likely to decline further as adoption grows. What happens when larger companies, like Meta, which is currently considering a shareholder suggestion to add bitcoin to its balance sheet—20x the size of MicroStrategy start to emulate MicroStrategy’s strategy? Two major barriers have historically constrained corporate adoption of Bitcoin: reputational risk and unfavorable accounting rules. Both have shifted dramatically in recent months: Until recently, companies faced significant hurdles in adopting Bitcoin. CEOs and boards were concerned about shareholder lawsuits, regulatory scrutiny, and negative media coverage. However, as Bitcoin gains acceptance at institutional and governmental levels, these fears are dissipating. Post-election, Bitcoin has seen growing bipartisan support in Washington, making it increasingly “commonplace—and even popular—to own Bitcoin,” according to Hougan. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) introduced a new guideline, ASU 2023-08, that fundamentally changes how Bitcoin is accounted for. Previously, companies were required to mark Bitcoin as an intangible asset, forcing them to write down its value during price declines but preventing upward adjustments when prices rose. Under the new rule, Bitcoin can now be marked to market, allowing companies to recognize profits as its price appreciates. This change removes a significant disincentive and is expected to drive exponential growth in corporate Bitcoin holdings. Corporate motivations for holding Bitcoin mirror those of individual investors. Hougan outlines several reasons: Hougan asserts that the motivations behind corporate adoption matter less than the magnitude of demand. “You just need to look at the numbers,” he writes. “Where does all this demand look like it’s going? And what would that mean for the market?” Hougan’s memo paints a bullish picture of Bitcoin’s future. If hundreds of companies follow MicroStrategy’s lead, the cumulative demand could drive Bitcoin’s price significantly higher in the coming year. With 70 companies already on board under less favorable conditions, the stage is set for an explosion in adoption. This trend not only highlights Bitcoin’s evolving role as a treasury asset but also underscores its growing acceptance as a mainstream financial instrument. For mature investors, the implications are clear: the next 18 months could mark a pivotal period in Bitcoin’s journey from speculative asset to institutional cornerstone. With reputational risks fading, accounting rules evolving, and demand accelerating, Bitcoin’s integration into corporate treasuries appears inevitable. Hougan’s analysis invites investors to consider the broader implications: If corporations truly embrace Bitcoin at scale, what could that mean for the market’s future? For savvy investors, the answer might lie in acting sooner rather than later. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

Title: Bitcoin Spot ETFs See $1.86 Billion Inflows, Extend 3-Week Positive Streak

The Bitcoin Spot ETFs, one of the most exciting financial markets at the moment, closed out another week with net inflows resulting in three consecutive weeks of gains. In tandem, the Ethereum Spot ETFs also produced an overall positive performance to record their first weekly net inflows in 2025. Following a turbulent end to December 2024, the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs have launched 2025 on a strong bullish note with significant market inflows reminiscent of their impressive performance in the majority of Q4 2024. According to data from ETF analytics site Farside Investors, these Bitcoin ETFs recorded an aggregate inflow of $1.862 billion in the third trading week of 2025 resulting in a total net flow of $2.42 billion in the new year. Interestingly, this week started on a negative note as these ETFs suffered withdrawals valued at $493.9 million between 13 January – 14 January amidst a Bitcoin flash crash to below $90,000. However, a surge in Bitcoin prices in the remaining three trading days corresponded with a rise in investors’ confidence translating to a cumulative inflow of $2.35 billion during this period. In familiar fashion, BlackRock’s IBIT registered the largest net inflows of the week valued at $745.7 million, with Fidelity’s FBTC taking second with investments worth $680.2 million. Bitwise’s BITB and Ark’s ARKB also registered significant inflows, totaling $216 million and $204.7 million, respectively. Other ETFs such as Invesco’s BTCO, Grayscale’s BTC, WisdomTree’s BTCW, VanEck’s HODL, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC recorded modest net inflows of not more than $40.1 million. Unsurprisingly, Grayscale’s GBTC produced the only net outflow of the week valued at $87.7 million. Meanwhile, Valkyrie’s BRRR was also another outlier registering zero net flows. At the time of writing, BlackRock’s IBIT maintains its market dominance with $38.41 billion in cumulative net inflow. IBIT also boasts $59.28 billion in net assets accounting for almost half of the total net assets ($120.95 billion) in the Bitcoin Spot ETF market. In addition to the strong performance of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, Ethereum ETFs recorded a net inflow of $212 million, signaling a return to positive gains after a rocky start to 2025. The BlackRock ETHA emerged as the focal center of these gains, registering $151.3 million in net flows over the week. At the time of writing, the Ethereum Spot ETFs now hold a total net asset of $12.66 billion representing 2.99% of Ethereum’s market cap. On the spot market, Ethereum continues to trade at $3,297, with Bitcoin now valued at $104,837. Semilore Faleti is a cryptocurrency writer specialized in the field of journalism and content creation.

Title: The Slop Society

Full Content:
In the last week we've seen the emergence of the true Meta — and the true Mark Zuckerberg — as the company ended its fact-checking program, claiming that (and I quote) "fact checkers have been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created" on both Instagram and Facebook, the latter of which was shown in a study from George Washington University to, by design, "afford antivaccine content producers several means to circumvent the intent of misinformation removal policies." Meta has also killed its diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Shortly after announcing the policies, Zuckerberg went on the Joe Rogan Experience and had a full-scale pissfit, claiming that corporations are "culturally neutered" and that companies should have both "more masculine energy" and "[have a culture] that celebrates the aggression a bit more," adding that said culture would "[have] its own merits that are really positive." Zuckerberg believes that modern corporate culture has somehow framed masculinity as bad, something he does not attempt to elaborate upon, frame with any kind of evidence (after all, it's Joe Rogan), or really connect to anything besides a sense of directionless grievance. This means that Meta has now "[gotten rid of] a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and gender that are the subject of frequent political discourse and debate," which in practice means that Meta now allows you to say that being gay is a mental illness or describe immigrants as "filth." Casey Newton at Platformer — who I have been deeply critical of (and will be later in this piece!) — has done an excellent job reporting on exactly how horrifying these policies are, revealing how Meta's internal guidelines allow Facebook users to say that trans people are both mentally ill and don't exist (to be clear, if you feel this way, stop reading and take a quick trip to the garage with your car keys), and included one of the most wretched things I've ever read: that Alex Schultz, Meta's CMO, a gay man, "suggested in an internal post that people seeing their queer friends and family members abused on Facebook and Instagram could lead to increased support for LGBTQ rights." This is the kind of social network that Mark Zuckerberg wants — an unrestrained, unfiltered, unrepentantly toxic and noxiously heteronormative, one untethered by the frustrating norms of "making sure that a social network of billions of people doesn't actively encourage hate of multiple different marginalized groups." Finally, Mark Zuckerberg can do whatever he wants, as opposed to the past 20 years, where it's hard to argue that he's faced an unrelenting series of punishments. Zuckerberg's net worth recently hit $213 billion, he's running a company with a market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion that he can never be fired from, he owns a 1400-acre compound in Hawaii, and while dealing with all this abject suffering, he was forced to half-heartedly apologize during a senate hearing where he was tortured (translation: made to feel slightly uncomfortable) after only having six years to recover from the last time when nothing happened to him in a senate hearing. Sarcasm aside, few living people have had it easier than Mark Zuckerberg, a man who has been insulated from consequence, risk, and responsibility for nearly twenty years. The sudden (and warranted) hysteria around these monstrous changes has an air of surprise, framing Meta (and Zuckerberg's) moves as a "MAGA-tilt" to "please Donald Trump," which I believe is a comfortable way to frame a situation that is neither sudden nor surprising. Mere months ago, the media was fawning over Mark Zuckerberg's new look, desperate to hear about why he's wearing gold chains, declaring that he had "the swagger of a Roman emperor" and that he had (and I quote the Washington Post) transformed himself from "a dorky, democracy-destroying CEO into a dripped-out, jacked AI accelerationist in the eyes of potential Meta recruits." Zuckerberg was, until this last week, being celebrated for the very thing people are upset about right now — flimsy, self-conscious and performative macho bullshit that only signifies strength to weak men and those credulous enough to accept it, which in this case means "almost every major media outlet." The only thing he did differently this time was come out and say it. After all, there was no punishment or judgment for his last macho media cycle, and if anything he proved that many will accept whatever he says in whatever way he does it. Yet I want to be clear that what you're seeing with Meta — and by extension Zuckerberg — is not a "sudden" move, but the direct result of a man that has never, ever been held in check. It is a fantasy to describe — or even hint — that these changes are the beginning of some sort of unrestrained Meta, rather than part of the intentional destruction of the market leader in growth-at-all-costs Rot Economics. As I wrote in the middle of last year, Meta has spent years gradually making the experience of using its products worse in pursuit of perpetual growth. When I say "intentionally," I mean that product decisions — such as limiting the information in notifications as a means of making users and heavily promoting clickbait headlines as a means of keeping people on the site longer — have been made for years, at times in broad daylight, that have led to the deterioration of the core experiences of both Facebook and Instagram. Some are touting Zuckerberg's current move as some sort of master plan to appease Trump and conservatives, suggesting that this is a "MAGA-fication" of these platforms, where conservatives will somehow be given preferential treatment, such as, say, Facebook's recommendation engine promoting dramatically more conservative media than other sources. Which is something that already fucking happened! In 2020, journalist Kevin Roose created an automated Twitter account called "Facebook's Top 10," listing the top-performing (as in what posts were shared, viewed and commented on the most) link posts by U.S. Facebook pages on a daily basis, something he was able to do by connecting to Facebook's "CrowdTangle" data analytics tool, a product created for researchers and journalists to understand what was happening on the world's largest social network. Roose's reporting revealed that Meta's top-performing links regularly skewed toward right wing influencers like Dan Bongino, Ben Shapiro and Sean Hannity, outlets like Fox News, and the page of president-elect Donald Trump. Internally, Meta was freaking out, suggesting to Roose that "engagement" was a misleading measurement of what was popular on Facebook, suggesting the real litmus test being "reach," as in how many people saw it. Roose also reported that internal arguments at Meta led it to suggesting it’d make a Twitter account of its own that had a more "balanced" view based on internal data. Meta even suggested the obvious answer — sharing reach data — would vindicate its position, only for CrowdTangle's CEO to add that "false and misleading news stories also rose to the top of those lists." These stories danced around one important detail: that these stories were likely recommended by Facebook's algorithm, which has reliably and repeatedly skewed conservative for many years. A study in The Economist from September 2020 found that the most popular American media outlets on Facebook in a one month period were Breitbart and Fox News, and that both Facebook page engagements and website views heavily skewed conservative. While one could argue that this might be the will of the users, what a user sees on Facebook is almost entirely algorithmic, and thus it's reasonable to assume that said algorithm was deliberately pushing conservative content. At this time, Meta's Head of Public Policy was Joel Kaplan, a man whose previous work involved working as George W. Bush's Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, as well as handling public policy and affairs for Energy Future Holdings, which involved three private equity firms buying Texas power company TXU for $45 billion and immediately steering it into bankruptcy due to the $38.7 billion in debt Energy Future Holdings was forced to take on as a means of acquiring TXU. Jeff Horwitz reports in his book Broken Code that Kaplan personally intervened when Facebook's health team attempted to remove COVID conspiracy movie Plandemic from its recommendation engine, and Facebook only did so once Roose reported that it was the most-engaged link in a 24 hour period. Naturally, Meta's choice wasn't to "fix things" or "improve" or "take responsibility." By the end of 2021, Meta had disbanded the team that ran CrowdTangle, and in early 2022, the company had stopped registering new users. In early 2024 — months before the 2024 elections — CrowdTangle was officially shut down, though Facebook Top 10 had stopped working in the middle of 2023. Meta hasn't "made a right-wing turn." It’s been an active arm of the right wing media for nearly a decade, actively empowering noxious demagogues like Alex Jones, allowing him to evade bans and build massive private online groups on the platform to disseminate content. A report from November 2021 by Media Matters found that Facebook had tweaked its news algorithm in 2021, helping right-leaning news and politics pages to outperform other pages using "sensational and divisive content." Another Media Matters report from 2023 found that conservatives were continually earning more total interactions than left or non-aligned pages between January 1 2020 and December 31 2022, even as the company was actively deprioritizing political content. A 2024 report from non-profit GLAAD found that Meta had continually allowed widespread anti-trans hate content across Instagram, Facebook, and Threads, with the company either claiming that the content didn't violate its community standards or ignoring reports entirely. While we can — and should — actively decry Meta's disgusting new standards, it's ahistorical to pretend that this was a company that gave a shit about any of this stuff, or took it seriously, or sought to protect marginalized people. It's a testament to the weak and inconsistent approach that the media has taken to both Meta and Mark Zuckerberg that any of these changes are being framed as anything other than Meta formalizing the quiet reality of its platforms: that whatever gets engagement is justified, even if it's hateful, racist, violent, cruel, or bigoted. To quote Facebook's then-Vice President Andrew Bosworth in an internal email from 2017, "all the work that [Facebook] does in growth is justified," even if it's bullying, or a terrorist attack, and yes, that's exactly what he said. One might think that Bosworth would be fired for sending this email. He's now Meta's Chief Technology Officer. It's time to stop pretending that this company was ever something noble, or good, or well-meaning. Mark Zuckerberg is a repressed coward, as far from "manly" as one can get, because true masculinity is a sense of responsibility for both oneself and others, and finding strength in supporting and uplifting them with sincerity and honesty. Meta, as an institution, has been rotten for years, making trillions of dollars as it continually makes the service worse, all to force users to spend more time on the site, even if it's because Facebook and Instagram are now engineered to interrupt users' decisionmaking and autonomy with a constant slew of different forms of sponsored and algorithmicly-curated content. The quality of the experience — something the media has categorically failed in covering — has never been lower on either Facebook or Instagram. I am not sure how anyone writing about this company for the last few years has been able to do so with a straight face. The products suck, they're getting worse, and yet the company has never been more profitable. Facebook is crammed with fake accounts, AI-generated slop, and nonsense groups teeming with boomers posting that they "wish we'd return to a culture of respect" as they're recommended their third racist meme of the day. Instagram is a carousel of screen-filling sponsored and recommended content, and users are constantly battling with these products to actually see the things that they log on to see. I want to be explicit here: for years, using Facebook has been a nightmare for many, many years. And, to repeat myself, this has been the case for years. Meta has been gradually (yet aggressively) reducing the quality of the Facebook and Instagram experience with utter disregard for user safety, all while flagrantly ignoring its own supposed quality and safety standards. It's a comfortable lie to say that Meta has "suddenly" done something, because it gives the media (and society at large) air cover for ignoring a gaping wound in the internet. Two of the world's largest social networks are run — and have been run — with a blatant contempt for the user, misinforming and harming people at scale, making the things they want to see harder to find as they're swamped by an endless stream of sponsored and recommended content that either sells them something or gets them to engage further with the platform with little care whether the engagement is positive, fun or useful. Casey Newton of Platformer has done an admirable job covering Meta in the last two weeks, but it's important to note that he was cheerfully covering Zuckerberg's "expansive view of the future" as recently as September 25, 2024, happily publishing how "Zuckerberg was back on the offensive," somehow not seeing anything worrying about Zuckerberg's t-shirt referencing Julius Caesar, the historic dictator that perpetuated a genocide in the Gallic wars. Newton felt it unnecessary to mention the utterly atrocious quality of Facebook while quoting Zuck saying things like "in every generation of technology, there is a competition of ideas for what the future should look like." Yet the most loathsome thing Newton published was this: This is paper tiger analysis — stenography for the powerful, masked as deep thoughts. This specific paragraph is exactly where Newton could've said something about how worrying Zuckerberg modeling himself on a Roman emperor was. How this company was, despite oinking about how it’s building the future, letting its existing products deteriorate as it deliberately turned the screws to juice engagement. Casey Newton has regularly and reliably turned his back on the truth — that Meta's core products are really quite bad — in favor of pumping up various artificial intelligence products and vague promises about a future that just arrived and fucking sucks. The reason I am singling Newton out is that it is very, very important to hold the people that helped Zuckerberg succeed accountable, especially as they attempt to hint that they've always been an aggressive advocate for the truth. Newton is fully capable of real journalism — as proven by his recent coverage — but has chosen again and again to simply print whatever Mark Zuckerberg wants to say. I am also going hard in the paint against Newton because of something else he wrote at the end of last year — "The phony comforts of AI skepticism" — where Newton sloppily stapled together multiple different pieces of marketing collateral to argue that not only was AI the future, but those that critiqued it were doing so in a cynical, corrupt way, singling out independent critic Gary Marcus. I'm not going to go through it in detail — Edward Ongweso Jr. already did so — but I think there are far better comforts for Newton than his ambiguous yet chummy relationship with the powerful. I also did not like something Newton said at the end of a (paywalled) blog about what he learned from the reaction to his piece about AI skeptics. Newton said, and I quote, that he was "taking detailed notes on all bloggers writing ’financial analyses’ suggesting that OpenAI will go bankrupt soon because it's not profitable yet." I do not like bullies, and I do not like threats. Suggesting one is "taking detailed notes on bloggers" is an attempt to intimidate people that are seriously evaluating the fact that OpenAI burns $5 billion a year and has no path to profitability. I don't know if this is about me, nor do I particularly care. I have, however, been taking detailed notes on Casey Newton for quite some time. While Newton's metaverse interview from 2021 was deeply irresponsible in how much outright nonsense it printed, arguably his most disgraceful was his October 26 2021 piece called "The Facebook Papers' missing piece" — an interview with an anonymous "integrity worker" that attempted to undermine the Wall Street Journal's Facebook Files (that revealed in that "Facebook Inc. knows, in acute detail, that its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm, often in ways only the company fully understands"), in a seeming attempt to discredit (by proxy) the bravery of Frances Haugen, the whistleblower that provided the documents that led to this reporting. It's utterly repulsive corporate hand-washing, and it's important context for any criticism he has of Meta going forward, especially if he tries to suggest he's always held it to account. I think Newton seems a little more comfortable with the powerful's messaging than he should. He's argued that while AI companies have hit a scaling wall, it's actually okay, that NFTs went finally mainstream in 2022, that Clubhouse was the future, that live audio was Zuckerberg's "big bet on creators" in 2021 due to "the shift in power from institutions to individuals" (Facebook shut down its podcast service a year later), that — and I cannot see the full text here, because it's paywalled — "metaverse pessimists were missing something" because "Meta's grand vision [was] already well on its way" in November 2021, that Meta's leadership changed its mind about its name because "Facebook [was] not the future of the company," that Axie Infinity — a crypto/web3 Pokémon clone that has created its own form of indentured servitude in the global south backed by Andreessen Horowitz — was "turning gaming on its head" (the game sucks)...okay, I'll stop. Casey has also, at times, had dalliances with criticisms — sometimes even of Facebook! No, really! — but it's hard to take them seriously when he writes a piece for The Verge about how "Google plans to win its antitrust trial," printing the legal and marketing opinion of one of the largest companies in the world knowing full-well that the Department of Justice would not get such an opportunity. In emails revealed in the Department of Justice's antitrust trial against Google Search, Google specifically mentioned having briefed Newton with the intention of, and I quote, "look[ing] for ways to drive headlines on [Google's] own terms." In Newton's defense, this is standard PR language, but it is, within the context of what I'm writing, hard to ignore. The reason I am so fucking furious at Newton is he is part of the media machine that has helped repeatedly whitewash Mark Zuckerberg and his cronies, running glossy puff-pieces with scumbags like Nick Clegg, and saying things like "the transition away from Facebook’s old friends and family-dominated feeds to Meta’s algorithmic wonderland seems to be proceeding mostly without incident." That line, I add, was published in 2023, two years after the release of The Facebook Files, which revealed that the company knew its algorithmic timeline had a propensity to push users into increasingly-radical echo chambers. And one year after Amnesty International published a report accusing Facebook’s algorithms of “supercharging the spread of harmful anti-Rohingya content in Myanmar” amidst a genocide that saw an estimated million displaced and tens of thousands massacred. Newton has spent years using his vast platform to subtly defend companies actively making their products worse, occasionally proving he can be a real journalist (his work on the acquisition of Twitter was genuinely great), only to slip back into the comfortable pajamas of "Are We Being Too Mean To Meta?" The media — especially people like Newton — are extremely influential over public policy and the overall way that society views the tech industry. As an experienced, knowledgeable journalist, Newton has too regularly chosen to frame "fair and balanced" as "let's make sure the powerful get their say too." As I've said — and will continue to say — Casey Newton is fully capable of doing some of the literal best journalism in tech, such as his coverage of the horrible lives of Facebook moderators, yet has, up until alarmingly recently, chosen to do otherwise. The cost, by the way, is that the powerful have used Newton and others as mouthpieces to whitewash their contemptuous and half-baked product decisions. I don't know Newton's intentions, nor will I attempt to guess at them. What I will say is that as a result of Casey Newton's work, Mark Zuckerberg and his products have received continual promotion of their ideas and air cover for their failures, directly influencing public opinion in the process. Worse still, Newton has acted for years like nothing was wrong with the quality of platforms themselves. Had Newton written with clarity and purpose about the erosion of quality in Facebook and Instagram, Zuckerberg would have lost a valuable way to convince the 150,000+ people that read Platformer that things were fine, that the quality was fine, that Meta is an innovative company, and that there was no reason to dislike Mark Zuckerberg. There was, and there always will be. Putting aside the horrifying person he obviously is, Zuckerberg is a career liar and a charlatan, and has deliberately made the lives of billions of people worse as a means of increasing revenue growth. And I believe that he's about to inspire a new era of decay, where tech executives, unburdened by their already-flimsy approach to societal norms and customer loyalty, will begin degrading experiences at scale, taking as many liberties as possible. Meta has fired the starting gun of the Slop Society. In an interview with the Financial Times from December 2024, Meta's Vice President of Product for Generative AI (Connor Hayes) said that Meta "expect[s] AIs to actually, over time, exist on [Meta's] platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do," each one having their own bios and profile pictures and the ability to "generate and share content powered by AI on the platform." This came hot off the heels of Zuckerberg saying in a quarterly earnings call that Meta would "...add a whole new category of content, which is AI generated or AI summarized content or kind of existing content pulled together by AI in some way," effectively promising to drop AI slop into feeds already filled full of recommended and sponsored content that gets in the way of you seeing real human beings. This led to a scandal where users discovered what they believed to be brand new AI profiles. Karen Attiah of the Washington Post wrote a long thread on Bluesky (and a piece in the post itself) about her experience talking to a bot she (fairly!) described as "digital blackface," with Meta receiving massive backlash for bots that would happily admit they were trained by a bunch of white people. It turns out these bots had been around for around a year in various forms but were so unpopular that nobody really noticed until the Financial Times story, leading to Meta deleting the bots, at least for now. I am 100% sure that these chatbots will return, because it's fairly obvious that Meta intends to fill your feeds with content either entirely generated or summarized by generative AI, be it with fake profiles or content itself. AI-generated slop already dominates the platform, and as discussed earlier, the quality of the platform has fallen into utter disrepair, mostly because Meta's only concern is keeping you on the platform to show you ads or content it’s been paid to show you, even if the reason you're seeing it is because you can't find the stuff you actually want to find. That's because all roads lead back to the Rot Economy — the growth-at-all-costs mindset that means that the only thing that matters is growth of revenue, which comes from showing as many ads to you as possible. It's almost ridiculous to call us "users" of Facebook at this point. We are the used, the punished, the terrorized, the tricked, the scammed, and the abused, constantly forced to navigate through layers of abstraction between the thing we are allegedly using and the features we'd like to use. It's farcical how little attention has been given to how bad tech products have gotten, and few have decayed as severely as Facebook thanks to its near-monopoly on social media. I, personally, would rather not use Instagram, but there are people I know that I only really speak to there, and I know many people who have the same experience. As Zuckerberg and his ilk are intimately aware, people really don't have anywhere else to go, which — along with a lack of regulation and a compliant media — has given them permission to adjust their services to increase advertising impressions, which in practice means giving you more reasons to stay on the platforms, which means "put more things in the way of what you want to see" rather than "create more compelling experiences for users." It's the same thing that happened with Google Search, where the revenue team pushed the search team to make search results worse as a means of increasing the amount of times people searched for things on Google — because a user that finds what they're looking for quickly spends less time on the site looking at ads. It's why the Apple App Store is so chaotically-organized and poorly-curated — Apple makes money on the advertising impressions it gets from you searching — and why so many products on the App Store have expensive and exploitative microtransactions, because Apple makes 30% off of all App Store revenue, even if the app sucks. And I believe that Zuckerberg loosening community standards and killing fact checking is just the beginning of tech's real era of decay. Trump, and by extension those associated with him, win in part by bulldozing norms and good taste. They do things that most of us agree are bad (such as being noxious and cruel, which I realize is a dilution) and would never do, moving the Overton window (the range of acceptable things in a society) further and further into Hell in the process. In this case, we've already seen tech's Overton window shift for years — a lack of media coverage of the actual decay of these products and a lack of accountability for tech executives (both in the media and regulation) has given companies the permission to quietly erode their services, and because everybody made things shittier over time, it became accepted practice to punish and trick customers with dark patterns (design choices to intentionally mislead people) to the point that the FTC found last year that the majority of subscription apps and websites use them. I believe, however, that Zuckerberg is attempting to move it further — to publicly say "we're going to fill your feeds with AI slop" and "we're firing 5% of our workers because they suck" and "we're going to have AI profiles instead of real people on the site you visit to see real people's stuff" and "we don't really give a shit about marginalized people" and "people are too mean to men" knowing, in his position as the CEO of one of the largest tech companies in the world, that people will follow. Tech has already taken liberties with the digital experience and I believe the Slop Era will be one where experiences will begin to subtly and overtly rot, with companies proudly boasting that they're making "adjustments to user engagement that will provide better business-forward outcomes," which will be code for "make them worse so that we make more money." I realize that there's an obvious thing I'm not saying: that the Trump administration isn't going to be any kind of regulatory force against big tech. Trump is perhaps the most transactional human being ever to grace the earth. Big tech, knowing this, has donated generously to the Trump inaugural fund. It’s why Trump has completely reversed his position on TikTok, having once wanted to ban the platform, now wants to give it a reprieve because he “won youth by 34 points” and “there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that.” Tech knows that by kissing the ring, it can do whatever it wants. Not that previous governments have been effective at curbing the worst excesses of big tech. Outside of the last few years, and specifically the work done by the FCC under Lina Khan, antitrust against big tech has been incredibly weak, and no meaningful consumer protections exist to keep websites like Facebook or Google functional for consumers, or limit how exploitative they can be. The media has failed to hold them accountable at scale, which has in turn allowed the Overton window to shift on quality, and now that Trump — and the general MAGAfied mindset of "you can say or do whatever you want if you do so confidently or loudly enough" — has risen to power again, so too will an era of outright selfishness and cruelty within the products that consumers use every day, except this time I believe they finally have permission to enter their slop era. I also think that Trump gives them confidence that monopolies like Facebook, Instagram, Microsoft 365 (Microsoft's enterprise monopoly over business productivity software), Google Search, and Google Advertising (remedies will take some time, and the Trump administration will likely limit any punishment it inflicts) will remain unchallenged. What I'm describing is an era of industrial contempt for the consumer, a continuation of what I described in Never Forgive Them, where big tech decides that they will do whatever they want to customers within the boundaries of the law, but with little consideration of good taste, user happiness, or anything other than growth. How this manifests in Facebook and Instagram will be fairly obvious. I believe that the already-decrepit state of these platforms will accelerate. Meta will push as much AI slop as it wants, both created by its generative models and their users, and massively ramp up content that riles up users with little regard for the consequences. Instagram will become more exploitative and more volatile. Instagram ads have been steadily getting more problematic, and I think Meta will start taking ads from just about anyone. This will lead to an initial revenue bump, and then, I hypothesize, a steady bleed of users that will take a few quarters to truly emerge. Elsewhere, we're already seeing the first sign of abusive practices. Both Google and Microsoft are now forcing generative AI features onto customers, with Google grifting business users by increasing the cost of Google Workspace by $2-per-user-per-month along with AI features they don't want, and Microsoft raising the price of consumer Office subscriptions, justifying the move by adding Copilot AI features that, again, customers really don't want. The Information's Jon Victor and Aaron Holmes add that it's yet to be seen what Microsoft does with the corporate customers using Microsoft's 365 productivity suite — adding Copilot costs $30-per-user-per-month — but my hypothesis is it will do exactly the same thing that Google did to its business customers. I should also be clear that the reason they're doing this is that they're desperate. These companies must express growth every single quarterly earnings or see their stock prices crater, and big tech companies have oriented themselves around growth as a result — meaning that they're really not used to having to compete for customers or make products they like. For over a decade, tech has been rewarded for creating growth opportunities empowered by monopolistic practices, and I'd argue that the cultures that created the products that people remember actually liking are long-dead, their evangelists strangled by the soldiers of the Rot Economy. You are, more than likely, already seeing the signs that this is happening. The little features on the products you use that feel broken — like when you try and crop an image on iOS and it sometimes doesn't actually crop it, when the "copy link" button on Google Docs doesn't work, when a Google Search gives you a page of forum links that don't answer your question — and I expect things to get worse, possibly in new and incredibly frustrating ways. I deeply worry that we're going to enter the most irresponsible era of tech yet — not just in the harms that companies allow or perpetuate, but in the full rejection of their stewardship for the products themselves. Our digital lives are already chaotic and poisonous, different incentives warring for our attention, user interfaces corroded by those who believe everything is justified in pursuit of growth. I fear that the subtle little problems you see every day will both multiply and expand, and that the core services we use will break down, because I believe the most powerful in big tech never really gave a shit and no longer believe they have to pretend otherwise.

Title: TikTok stops working for US users, disappears from Apple, Google stores

Print TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans. President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned." Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S. app stores as of late Saturday. "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday." It was not clear if any U.S. users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working. TikTok, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, warned on Friday it would go dark in the U.S. on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent or shut down its U.S. operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security. The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action. "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the new White House statement. The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday accused the U.S. of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said. Users move to alternatives Uncertainty over the app's future had sent users -- mostly younger people -- scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote. Rivals Meta and Snap had also seen their share prices rise this month ahead of the ban, as investors bet on an influx of users and advertising dollars. "This is my new home now," wrote one user in a RedNote post, tagged with the words "tiktokrefugee" and "sad." Minutes after TikTok's U.S. shutdown, other users took to X, formerly called Twitter. "I didn’t really think that they would cut off TikTok. Now I’m sad and I miss the friends I made there. Hoping it all comes back in just a few days," wrote @RavenclawJedi. NordVPN, a popular virtual private network, or VPN, allowing users to access the internet from servers around the world, said it was "experiencing temporary technical difficulties." Web searches for "VPN" spiked in the minutes after U.S. users lost access to TikTok, according to Google Trends. Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform's e-commerce arm. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans this week in what one executive described as a "hair on fire" moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialize to keep the app running. There have been signs TikTok could make a comeback under Trump, who has said he wants to pursue a "political resolution" of the issue and last month urged the Supreme Court to pause implementation of the ban. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the U.S. presidential inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told Reuters. Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has also held talks about selling TikTok's U.S. operations to billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that. U.S. search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok U.S., a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok U.S. and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the U.S. Reuters is a news agency founded in 1851 and owned by the Thomson Reuters Corporation based in Toronto, Canada. One of the world's largest wire services, it provides financial news as well as international coverage in over 16 languages to more than 1000 newspapers and 750 broadcasters around the globe.

Title: Is corporate America going Maga?
Donald Trump’s election has accelerated a cultural shift in the nation’s boardrooms

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob Last week Amazon announced plans to release a “behind the scenes” documentary about Melania Trump, produced by the incoming US first lady herself. The tech giant reportedly paid $40mn for the exclusive deal just weeks after it donated $1mn to her husband Donald Trump’s inauguration committee and committed to livestreaming the ceremony on its Prime service. Before November’s presidential election, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also cancelled plans for The Washington Post, which he owns, to endorse Trump’s Democratic rival. Shortly after the election, he spoke favourably about Trump’s “energy around reducing regulation” and made a personal pilgrimage to have dinner with the incoming president at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Bezos’s rush to cosy up to the Trumps has been matched by corporate executives across America, as tech billionaires, financiers and the leaders of some of the US’s best-known consumer groups hurry to adjust to a more conservative zeitgeist in the wake of Trump’s election victory and the Republican sweep of both houses of Congress. In a mirror image of the 2020 corporate rush to support social justice causes after the murder of George Floyd by a policeman, companies today are reshaping the way they interact with their customers, employees and society at large. Some of the moves, such as the parade of CEOs visiting Trump in Florida, the donations, and the effort to do business with people in his inner circle, appear designed to curry favour with a man famous for attacking companies and executives he dislikes. But the election has also accelerated a wider shift back to more conservative social and political stances and an embrace of unfettered capitalism. Companies are scrapping diversity, equity and inclusion departments, cutting their support for racial diversity charities, and dropping out of climate change groups. They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

In a mirror image of the 2020 corporate rush to support social justice causes after the murder of George Floyd by a policeman, companies today are reshaping the way they interact with their customers, employees and society at large. Some of the moves, such as the parade of CEOs visiting Trump in Florida, the donations, and the effort to do business with people in his inner circle, appear designed to curry favour with a man famous for attacking companies and executives he dislikes. But the election has also accelerated a wider shift back to more conservative social and political stances and an embrace of unfettered capitalism. Companies are scrapping diversity, equity and inclusion departments, cutting their support for racial diversity charities, and dropping out of climate change groups. They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson In a mirror image of the 2020 corporate rush to support social justice causes after the murder of George Floyd by a policeman, companies today are reshaping the way they interact with their customers, employees and society at large. Some of the moves, such as the parade of CEOs visiting Trump in Florida, the donations, and the effort to do business with people in his inner circle, appear designed to curry favour with a man famous for attacking companies and executives he dislikes. But the election has also accelerated a wider shift back to more conservative social and political stances and an embrace of unfettered capitalism. Companies are scrapping diversity, equity and inclusion departments, cutting their support for racial diversity charities, and dropping out of climate change groups. They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Companies are scrapping diversity, equity and inclusion departments, cutting their support for racial diversity charities, and dropping out of climate change groups. They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Saw a headline today that some CEOs are holding out and staying with the discrimination and sexism angle of DEI and quotas. Fine. Their competitors can get the cream of the crop of fine talent meaning the men will be allowed to be hired and promoted based on superior merit. The others will be just like Los Angeles with Karen Bass types of bumbling female affirmative action hires who are totally incompetent. ,,, Jeffrey spends his days in a sheltered workshop, not really having to produce anything and even less now universities run agendas. If his phone doesn't ring it won't matter as much. Those who matter more are adapting. What would a tithing scheme to Democrats be called? Trump is the excuse. The balance books is the real reason. Trump is the wealthiest President by far going into office. He does not need a crackhead son to shuffle him 10% in exchange for a compromised nation. Merit, not participation trophies, please. Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg used to look like that. The smart corporate board would have done exactly that. I find liberals do that. They will advocate and push for positions and then do the opposite. An example of this is Democrat women who say to not marry white men, but most of them have married white men. It’s like they are really clearing the board for themselves. The DEI, the ESG throwing away retirement funds into woke garbage that loses money for investors; it better be gone.

Title: Jim Cramer Says GE Vernova Inc. (GEV) Will Probably Build Small Nuclear Reactors

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 15 Stocks & The California Wildfires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. In a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the devastation ushered in by the California wildfire calamity, social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and interest rates. Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said "Healthcare really hasn't had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher." He added that the US government's export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer "I still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I've got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can't." He added "And then David, I've got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal." The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg's thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated "you're done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time. Returning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him "The whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we've had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed." As for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there's "Not enough talk about the fires." The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined "I certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma." Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added "But more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it's going to impact the economy. We don't even know yet, what could be the results." One industry that's been at the center of media coverage whether it's for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, "Well I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There's a loss-sharing agreement that's terrible, there is a sense to me that it's going to take longer to come back than people realize. David, the rebuild will be immense, it's obviously not done." He added "And I think that if we're going to talk about what the economy, what's going to happen, one-fifth of the country is California. Obviously, this is just the South end, could be contained to Los Angeles. But you know David this is one of those things we can't really factor in but we must factor in, in terms of trying to figure out what it's gonna mean for the whole US economy." The CNBC host also shared his thoughts on some of the reasons behind the wildfires. "Yeah look I think that we're gonna look at this, we're gonna say, there are reasons why this happened. Reservoirs not working. Some issues, whether the firefighters were ready." Linking the calamity with interest rates, he commented, "But you know Carl the most important this is at least, if we're going to talk about the economy, if we're going to talk about the rate cuts versus rate increases, it may be a reason that we have to put things on a pause. Maybe when the smoke clears. Proverbial smoke and literal. It may mean that things are going to be slower." Cramer then returned to Zuckerberg's podcast appearance. According to him "Zuckerberg. I mean I gotta hand it to him, I mean he basically made the Justice Department's case against" the iPhone designer. He added "It's almost as if he sat down with, with the outgoing administration, Jonathan Kanter, and said, look let me tell you what I think" the firm is doing. Cramer concluded "Because everything that he's complaining about, the Justice Department is complaining about. Carl, it was one of the most damming interviews. I couldn't tell whether Mark was having fun, or whether he was just basically saying Apple is the axis of evil and others that play along because they all are scared. . . And he's not scared. He's tough. Taekwondo. . .it's a libertarian love fest." As for whether Zuckerberg's remarks were made to buttress his relationship with the incoming Trump administration, Cramer commented "Well he's, let's call him savvy. He talked about libertarian, but there were these moments, you know he lives on a ranch, and he has to shoot pigs. Okay, so he's pro-gun." However, Cramer added, "At one point, . . .it did have a kind of element of extremism that I'm not used to anyone having." He also speculated whether Zuckerberg was aware of how he sounded during the interview. According to Cramer: "And I think that Joe Rogan is sophisticated enough to be able to put a line out for Mark to really go for it. I don't know whether Mark realizes exactly how damming it sounds, and I think that it's a little of a shame if only just because he made me feel like that he himself really despises a company that we all love. I wish that there'd been some push back." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired recently For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). An aerial view of the energy producing facility, highlighting its potential of providing utilities to the public. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 89 GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) is an energy company that operates in the power generation and electrification industries. It is also among the handful of firms capable of manufacturing nuclear power reactors. The exposure has served GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) well since the stock is up by a whopping 205% over the past year. The strong share price performance is due to the AI data center industry's thirst for clean power generation which has grown the demand for nuclear power. Cramer, however, isn't a believer in the near-term potential of nuclear power; but, at the same time, he's a fan of GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV): "The company that would probably build them [small nuclear reactors] here is GE Vernova. They don't really have a game plan to do anything before twenty, uh, thirty two." Overall GEV ranks 5th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of GEV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GEV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans.President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app.TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned." Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday."The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday." Facebook, TikTok apps are seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021. (credit: DADO RUVIC/ILLUSTRATION/FILE PHOTO/REUTERS)It was not clear if any US users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working.A word of warningTikTok, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, warned on Friday it would go dark in the US on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security.The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action."We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.

Title: After Donald Trump’s win, global ETF flows brike record, hitting US$1.5 trillion in 2024

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The 2024 year set another record for global exchange traded funds. Global exchange traded fund flows hit a record US$1.5 trillion ($2.7 trillion) last year with the buying frenzy accelerating after Donald Trump’s presidential victory in November. The net inflows obliterated the previous full-year record of $1.2t set in 2021 according to data from Morningstar, which includes most major investment markets except China and India. Total assets hit $13.8t, a rise of $2.7t during the year, and nearly five times the $2.9 billion level of a decade ago. Both equity and fixed income funds saw record inflows, with these two asset classes accounting for 95% of flows between them, despite an industry focus on alternative assets such as bitcoin. The record year is a reflection of the lure of rising markets, with many major equity benchmarks hitting record highs last year. It also highlights the ongoing switch away from the century-old mutual fund format to the lower cost and greater transparency, liquidity and convenience of ETFs. This is particularly true in the US where ETFs also have significant tax advantages. “ETFs are going gangbusters,” said Syl Flood, senior product manager at Morningstar. “Inflation-adjusted returns on short-term bond products, especially for US investors, are back to where they were before rates started rising, so it’s back to Tina [there is no alternative] to equities.” “ETFs seem to have a bit of a halo around them,” Flood added. “People want the ETF version of a strategy, if they can get it. The halo has been earned. ETFs have been great tools for helping investors reach their goals.” Flows peaked at the end of the year with November and December the two biggest months - totalling $310b in the US alone - after Trump’s re-election sparked hopes in some quarters of further stock market gains. “Investors’ ‘risk on’ posture was evident throughout the year and was further amplified by the US presidential election in November,” Flood said. “While markets closed the year with a whimper, ETF flows did not,” said Scott Chronert, global head of ETF research at Citi. “December marked the second-best flow month ever for US-listed ETFs. This was an impressive follow-up to the record-setting flow data we saw in November.” The rise of ETFs was not purely a US phenomenon, however, with net inflows in the rest of the world hitting $377b, according to Morningstar’s figures, comfortably above the previous peak of $292b in 2021, with every major domicile reporting record numbers. “South Korea had a blowout year, growing at a torrid 33% rate for the second straight calendar year,” Flood said. Ireland, Europe’s largest ETF hub, grabbed the lion’s share of these non-US flows, however, at some $226b. The ETF industry also accelerated its transition away from its traditional focus on passive, index-tracking funds in 2024. Assets held by actively managed ETFs topped $1t for the first time, rising 61% during the year, even as US-domiciled active mutual funds continued to bleed money. Net flows more than doubled from 2023’s previous record, hitting $339b. Actively managed ETFs now account for 7.8% of industry assets, up from 6.2% 12 months ago. For once, JPMorgan’s wildly popular $37.1b Equity Premium Income Fund (JEPI) was eclipsed in the active space, with iShares’ US Equity Factor Rotation Active ETF (DYNF) heading the leaderboard with $11.7b of net inflows, taking its total assets to $13.7b. Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at SSGA, who only covers US ETF flows, counted record inflows in no less than 19 categories last year, ranging from growth and small cap ETFs to those focused on derivative income and collateralised loan obligations. In another sense the industry is becoming more concentrated, however. At a time when the US share of global stock market capitalisation has risen to its highest level since the early 1970s, just three ETFs focused on the same index - BlackRock’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), State Street Global Advisors’ SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO) - accounted for $292bn, 19.5% of the global flows, as they took their combined assets to an unprecedented $2.1t. VOO alone took in an “astounding” $117b, Flood said, a record single-year tally for any ETF, as investors chased the index’s 25% annual gain. The other winner from this trend was S&P Global Ratings, which “dominated flows among benchmark index providers”, with the $475b of net new money subsumed by ETFs that track its indices taking its market share to 28%, up five percentage points in five years. Despite this, Invesco outshone BlackRock, Vanguard and SSGA in relative terms, with its assets rising 21% during 2024. The Atlanta house largely piggybacked on enthusiasm for the tech-heavy Nasdaq index, with its QQQ Trust (QQQ) and Nasdaq 100 (QQQM) ETFs proving popular, alongside the S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), its own take on the blue-chip index. There were some losers amid the oceans of winners, however. Some niches were out of favour on the fixed income side, including inflation-protected bond funds and emerging market bond ETFs. The latter was tipped into the red by outflows in December “as fears of a more protectionist US fiscal framework led to a stronger dollar and weighed returns”, Bartolini said. In equities, defensive sectors suffered $6.7b of outflows from US-listed ETFs, the second-worst figure ever, he added, led by healthcare, which shipped $7.4b. This pessimism was in complete contrast to the technology sector, where $33b of inflows accounted for 76% of US sector flows in 2024, well above tech’s 37% share of assets, something Bartolini attributed to “broad-based fervour” for artificial intelligence. - The Financial Times Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Why Should You Buy This Growth Stock For The Next 5 Years?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other growth stocks. Kevin Mahn, President & CIO at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, recently appeared on CNBC on January 6 to discuss the current market momentum and emphasize the need for investors to be selective in 2025 to find growth opportunities. He highlighted that while the MAG7 have led the market recently, their leadership may not continue. Mahn referenced historical data, noting that since 1950, there have been nine instances where the market rallied by 20% or more, with the market rising in eight of those cases. However, he pointed out that gains in the following year averaged only 3.6%, indicating a need for careful selection. He also acknowledged recent market trends, including a decline in the S&P 500's performance and a potential shift in investor sentiment following events like the Santa Claus Rally. He predicted a path of lower interest rates, expecting 50 basis points of cuts this year instead of the previously anticipated 100 basis points. Mahn suggested that this environment would create favorable conditions for stocks and bonds but urged investors to diversify beyond mega-cap tech stocks into sectors like biotech and aerospace. Earlier on January 3 as well, Mahn noted that after two consecutive years of gains, a third year of strong performance appears unlikely. He remarked that it seems the Grinch got in the way of the Santa Claus rally this year. He also addressed concerns from investors tempted to time the market or sell their holdings. He warned against trying to time the market, describing it as often futile. Instead, he advocated for rebalancing portfolios to align with long-term goals and risk tolerance. He suggested that the economic landscape is changing, with lower interest rates and stagnant economic growth expected moving forward. Mahn advised investors to take profits from sectors that previously led the market and consider reallocating those funds into different areas poised for future growth. He highlighted biotech as a promising sector, noting bipartisan agreement on the need to lower drug prices. This shift could lead large-cap pharmaceutical companies to seek new revenue sources, making smaller biotech firms attractive. Methodology We first sifted through online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. We then selected the stocks with high 5-year revenue growth and high analysts' upside potential. From those we picked 15 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 5-Year Revenue CAGR: 62.43% Upside Potential as of January 15: 30.72% NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs and manufactures GPUs for gaming and professional markets. It also develops AI platforms, high-performance computing solutions, and self-driving car technologies to power industries like gaming, data centers, and automotive. Bank of America maintained its $190 price target for the company recently, suggesting a 27% upside potential. This optimism is driven by the release of Blackwell GPUs, which have already secured 12 months of orders. At CES 2025, the company unveiled Project DIGITS, a personal AI supercomputer powered by the new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip. This compact system delivers petaflop-level AI performance while operating on standard household electricity. Project DIGITS is designed to empower researchers, data scientists, and students to develop and run large AI models locally. With 128GB of memory and up to 4TB of storage, the system is well-equipped to handle demanding AI workloads. In Q3 2024, NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) achieved record revenue of $35.1 billion, a 94% year-over-year surge. This was driven by a 112% increase in Data Center revenue to $30.8 billion. GPU revenue has demonstrated robust growth, surging 67% annually over the past three years. This performance is fueled by the demand for computing power necessitated by advancements in AI and ML. Manole Capital Management noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) more than tripled in value over the past year, due to strong AI-related demand and continued revenue growth that exceeds market expectations. Here's what it said in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “As of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.” Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. As we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Broadcom Inc. (AVGO): Dominating AI and Semiconductor Markets with Record Revenue Growth and Strategic Collaborations

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks. In the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth. The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025. The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.

A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) supplies semiconductor infrastructure software solutions. This company stands out as a worthwhile investment due to a combination of multiple factors. Firstly, as per the final report of the fiscal year 2024, the revenue grew 44% year-over-year to a record $51.6 billion, as infrastructure software revenue increased to $21.5 billion on the successful integration of VMware. Semiconductor revenue recorded was $30.1 billion, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion. AI revenue that grew 220% year-on-year was driven by the company’s leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. Secondly, the company is collaborating with different major tech companies, including Google, Meta Platforms, ByteDance, OpenAI, and Apple, to develop custom AI server chips, which will further solidify its position in the AI accelerator market and attract investors. Additionally, the company’s other AI solutions include PCIe Gen 5.0 switches, which serve as the open, standards-based fabric of choice for AI connectivity. They draw half the power of alternatives while offering industry-leading SerDes, telemetry and diagnostic capabilities. Overall AVGO ranks 8th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth. The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025. The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.

According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Stocks That Received Analyst Approval This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other stocks that received analyst approval this week. The US market performance in the last week was quite bullish, with the S&P, DOW, and NASDAQ boasting weekly gains of 3.71%, 3.73%, and 3.84% respectively. The week marked the last full week of the outgoing Democratic government, with Donald Trump set to be sworn in early next week. Just like the last time he became President, Donald Trump is set to make some drastic changes once he takes over. His energy policy and stance on crypto will continue to be of focus for most traders. During the outgoing week, a lot of companies received the backing of Wall Street analysts, among them quite a few energy and automobile companies. We looked at a few of those companies that received a boost from analysts this week. To come up with the list of 10 stocks that received analyst approval this week, we only considered companies with a market cap of at least $1 billion. A home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together. Netflix Inc. is a global entertainment services provider that offers a wide variety of documentaries, games, TV series, and movies. The company’s target price was downgraded from $1065 to $1040 by Oppenheimer based on valuation concerns. However, the analyst acknowledged that there were hardly any business headwinds and didn’t downgrade the rating. Seaport Global upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral, showing they were more bullish on the stock than Oppenheimer. At the end of 2024, the stock underperformed the S&P 500. Moreover, the company’s valuation is not attractive right now. At this point, investors are concerned about the continuous decline in share prices since last month. However, as the analyst ratings show, a lot of the current pessimism is priced in. The impact of the second season of Squid Game show will become apparent during this quarter and that could act as a catalyst for the stock’s next rally. There has been a huge transition in the TV and movie industry in the past 10 years. Being a streaming giant NFLX remained on top among its closest competitors (Amazon Prime Video and Disney) in terms of subscriber count. Having a high CFC ratio (the ability to pay back debt) of 22% shows its sound finances, despite having to spend large amounts of money on creating fresh content. Given all this information, Netflix is still the top choice for customers looking for streaming options. Investors can consider this downturn in price as an opportunity to re-analyze their investment strategy. Overall, NFLX ranks 9th on our list of received analyst approval this week. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Garmin's –$40B Pivot
URL: https://www.readtrung.com/p/garmins-40b-pivot
Time Published: 2025-01-18T23:35:06Z
Full Content:
Thanks for subscribing to SatPost. Welcome to the new subscribers that joined from Tyler Cowen’s blog (for “11 Best Things of 2024”) and Tim Ferriss’ Five Bullet Friday e-mail (“Jerry Seinfeld, Ichiro Suzuki and the Pursuit of Mastery”). I am a long-time fan of both and was honored to see their recommendations. Today, we are talking about Garmin (and how the $40B+ GPS pioneer survived the iPhone, Google Maps and Apple Watch). Also this week: Why are Nordic firms so successful? TikTok Ban (?) …and them fire posts (including Zuck) “Necessity is the mother of invention.” I have no idea who made this quote. It goes hard and the internet says Plato but the inspirational bathroom poster I bought from a Thai street market says it was Confucius, so I dunno. Whoever said it, the quote kept popping into my head as I read into the history of Garmin, the hardware technology firm that makes GPS products for automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness. My interest was piqued by the company’s +63% stock performance in 2024, sending its market cap to an all-time high of $40B+. It’s an impressive achievement when you consider that Garmin — which was founded in 1989 — almost got wiped out by huge challenges from Apple and Google. In 2008, Garmin made ~70% of its $3B+ in sales from personal GPS navigation devices for the car. That business line was completely wrecked by the combined launch of the iPhone and Google Maps in consecutive years. Then, just as the company was finding success with GPS-enabled watches for runners (growing from $0 to $1B between 2008 and 2014), Apple took another dump in Garmin’s front lawn by launching its Watch. Garmin just kept grinding it out and showed some serious corporate resilience. By 2018, Garmin’s sales were back to its previous 2008 highs but with a very different revenue mix. As shown in the chart below, Garmin has completely pivoted from a car navigation company to an outdoor and fitness tracking company with annual sales surpassing $5B. At a high level, Garmin was able to survive Big Tech because it is a vertically-integrated company that spends huge resources on R&D. This combination has allowed it to find new GPS markets, develop products for them and move quickly for the customers. Let’s walk through the story by looking at: The Invention of GPS and Founding of Garmin Pivot from Car Navigation to Outdoor & Fitness Garmin’s Secret Sauce is R&D We have to start the Garmin story in 1973. President Richard Nixon signed the Paris Peace Agreement to end the Vietnam War (after using sketchy backchannels to keep the war going so he could win the 1968 Presidential Election). Tricky Dick was also doing Watergate stuff that would force him to resign a year later. The previous president Lyndon B. Johnson died. OPEC started an oil embargo. Pink Floyd released the greatest album cover ever (“The Dark Side of the Moon”). James Blunt — who def has the funniest bio on X (“Proof that one song is all you need”) — wasn’t born yet but would randomly release a song called “1973” in 2007 (well, he says it’s because “1973” rhymes with “I will always be”). Most relevant for this article, the US Department of Defense (DoD) initiated the Global Positioning System (GPS) program to create a robust satellite navigation system. The program was designed for the military at the height of the Cold War (aiming missiles, tracking troop movements). A prototype satellite was launched in 1978 and the constellation was fully operational with 24 satellites by 1993 (curiously, Blunt hasn’t written a song about either of those years). An important detail for the early GPS days is how the US government split the network between military and civilian use. The catalyst for this change was a tragedy: in 1983, a Korean commercial airplane was flying from New York to Seoul and was shot down over Soviet airspace. President Ronald Reagan determined that the commercial availability of GPS would have likely prevented the attack and instructed the DoD to make GPS available for civilian use. They did so by creating two networks: Standard Positioning Service (SPS): Designed for civilian and commercial use, and accurate within 100 meters of a location. Precision Positioning Service (PPS): Designed for military use and accurate within 10 meters of a location. Why was the PPS 10x more accurate than the SPS? Because the DoD purposely scrambled the SPS so that enemy forces couldn’t take the civilian service and get the same capabilities as the US military. The private sector soon began experimenting with GPS technology. It was free to use but required (pretty expensive) antenna and receiver equipment. Early adopters included the oil & gas industry as well as customers that owned yachts and private planes (aka rich folk with a lot of cheddar). Two people interested in the GPS consumer market were Gary Burrell and Min Kao. Burrell was born in Kansas and had a Masters in electrical engineering from Wichita State University. Kao was born in Taiwan and moved to America to get advanced degrees including a PhD in electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee. In 1989 — when Kao was 50 and Burrell was 52 — they were both working as engineers at avionics firm AppliedSignals. The pair got to chatting and decided to launch a company that would sell GPS navigation devices. “The idea for Garmin was conceived during a casual dinner conversation with [my colleague Burrell],” says Kao about the company's founding moment in an interview with The Huffington Post in 2012. “The GPS constellation was still under construction, and it was being developed primarily for military purposes, but Gary and I began discussing its potential as the base technology for a wide array of consumer products. Our conversation became more animated when we envisioned creating products that would help guide pilots, boaters, drivers, and hikers safely and efficiently on their journeys.” They raised $4m from their own savings, family and friends to open a factory in Kansas under the name ProNav. It was the only money they ever had to raise because they came out the gate like gangbusters. The first product was released in 1990 and was a GPS navigation device for small boats and planes. It was an instant smash hit, with even the US Army purchasing their GPS devices for use in the Gulf War. A year later, they opened up a manufacturing plant in Taiwan. This early success was followed by a name change to Garmin, which combined the co-founders’ first names. The portmanteau signified that they “were personally invested in its success or failure” (side note: they definitely did the right order of names because “MinGar” would not have survived as a corporate entity for more than 6 months). By 1995, Garmin was already making $100m+ a year. Crucially, Kao and Burrell were hardcore technologists and not slick-backed hair MBAs. While Corporate America was going asset-light and outsourcing manufacturing overseas, Garmin brought more of its business in-house. They were engineering-first and owned their own distributors, warehouses, marketing teams and customer support call centres. Further, they re-invested funds into building new factories (Kansas, Taiwan), hiring R&D talent and applying for patents. Garmin’s approach had financial costs and took time but also allowed the company to quickly capitalize on new GPS-related opportunities. One such opportunity was a portable car navigator called the StreetPilot. Launched in 1998, the device — which looks quite comical now but probably gave pizza delivery drivers a massive chub — set Garmin up for an explosive decade of growth. In May 2000, President Bill Clinton put into effect a new policy that completely changed Garmin’s fortunes. According to this profile video of Garmin by CNBC, the President “issued an order for the military to stop scrambling civilian GPS technology, making it far more accurate and opening the GPS device market to all sorts of competition.” The impetus for Clinton’s decision was that the military had figured out other ways to jam enemy mis-use of the GPS network. And, of course, there were massive civilian opportunities for innovation and business. Even as the DotCom Bubble was bursting, Garmin was well-positioned as a GPS play (pun intended) and IPO’d in December 2000. Its public debut kicked off an incredible 8-year run that would see revenue 10x from $346m in 2000 to $3.5B in 2008 (when car navigation GPS devices — aka personal navigation devices (PND) — made up 70% of sales). There were competitors such as Magellan, Honeywell and TomTom but Garmin became the go-to consumer brand for GPS in the car. The sales boom was catalyzed by: growing awareness of Garmin automakers trying to soup up their vehicles improved accuracy of GPS navigation integration of WiFi for routing and traffic data lower input costs (growth in consumer demand for electronics led to a decrease in costs for items Garmin required such as microchips, LCD screens, antennas, batteries etc.) the experience curve (which is when the cost of making a product declines due to higher volumes and more learnings) The earliest GPS devices from the 1980s cost north of $10,000. Garmin’s first StreetPilot devices were ~$600 and fell to about $300 in 2008 (with way more features than the first version including voice, navigation, color and better mapping). All of this progress hit a wall in 2009. Launched in 2007, the iPhone had kicked off a smartphone revolution. Then Google Maps’ came out a year later with a price point of $0, which was slightly more appealing to customers than $300+. According to multiple anonymous sources at the company, here is a photo of the executives when they saw the launch of the Google Maps app: Over the next two years, Garmin’s sales fell from $3.5B in 2008 to $2.7B in 2010. Garmin sales wouldn’t fall any further but — as mentioned earlier — it took a decade for Garmin’s sales to get back to $3.5B. If you adjust for inflation, Garmin didn’t get back to its 2008 revenue high-water mark until 2023. The largest peak-to-trough drawdown for Garmin’s stock was ~90% (taking its market cap to under $3B in Q4 2008, with additional pain from the Great Financial Crisis). Fortunately, the company’s salvation was already cooking internally. Remember how we talked about Garmin’s commitment to R&D? Just as they had found a way to take the GPS from the ocean (boats) to air (planes) to the street (cars), Garmin’s R&D team had identified fitness as a niche market all the way back in 2003. Here’s the origin story according to Fortune: For all the time, effort, and money companies plow into the endless hunt for innovation, many of their best ideas come from within. A Procter & Gamble chemist in the 19th century figured a bar of soap that floated in the tub would enliven the bathing experience, and Ivory Soap was born. In the 1970s, a 3M employee, craving a better way to mark pages in his hymnal, modified an uncommercialized adhesive invented a few years earlier by a colleague; Post-it Notes became an iconic 3M success story. And at Garmin, a suburban Kansas maker of navigational devices for boats, planes, and cars, a group of running-obsessed employees applied their know-how to their hobby—a move that revitalized the company when it badly needed a win. It was the early 2000s, and Garmin had grown from its niche of making consumer devices utilizing the government’s global positioning system, or GPS, technology. Together with rival TomTom, Garmin dominated the market for in-car navigational devices, game-changing gadgets that marked the beginning of the end for foldable maps. GPS for personal fitness wasn’t popular before the Garmin jogging klatch began noodling. “They said, ‘We do all these GPS things. Why don’t we have a GPS product for runners?’ ” recalls Cliff Pemble, Garmin’s CEO and a 31-year company veteran. In 2003, Garmin offered its first fitness wearable, the Forerunner 101. What began as an employee side project has come to define the company nearly two decades on—especially after a lethal technology combination of the iPhone and Google Maps laid waste to Garmin’s core automotive business. The transition from car navigation to fitness GPS was far from seamless, though. Garmin’s first instinct to take on the iPhone/Google Maps disruption was to make its own mobile device. In 2008, the company collaborated with Asus to release the G60 Nuviphone, a GPS-enabled phone with a 3.5 inch screen running on Windows Mobile (lol). The Nuviphone cost $300 and if you bought it instead of just a fully-featured iPhone that was under $500 subsidized by carriers, then you were a completely lost cause and hopefully re-evaluated your entire life afterwards. However, very few people chose the “lost cause and need to re-evaluate your life” route and Garmin discontinued the product in 2010. Around this time, Garmin also took a few shots at making subscription-based apps for iPhone and Android. Nothing stuck. While these attempts at new mobile business lines didn’t take off, the aforementioned Forerunner — the pager-sized device that became the world’s first GPS-powered trainer — had catalyzed a fitness segment including watches and trackers that reached $400m in 2008 (10%+ of Garmin’s total sales). Building off that base, Garmin kept improving the form factor and integrating more features (activity tracking, training plans for niche sports, sleep coaching, stored maps, better battery life, lights). One notable outcome from Garmin’s approach is that it’s able to price discriminate to a very fine T. Customers have so many options to pay for the exact functionality they need. Garmin’s fitness segment crossed $1B for the first time in 2015. As fate would have it, Apple began selling its Watch in March of the same year. The Apple Watch has gone on to sell over 100m units and totally re-make the industry. A lot of other watchmakers have been crushed but Garmin — despite initial (and very valid) concerns — has continued to truck along even as Apple positioned its Watch as a health and fitness device. Why have Garmin watches been able to thrive? A Reddit discussion from last summer had some solid insights: “Apple Watch is a Smartwatch with fitness features, Garmin is a Fitness watch (with admittedly lacking) smartwatch features. I think if you get an Apple Watch expecting it to do Garmin'esque things you'll be disappointed, especially in terms of battery life.” “Garmin offers more and — typically with Apple’s yearly release schedule — I don’t see Apple matching Garmin’s functionality anytime soon.” [Note: Garmin fitness watches start at $300 and can get up to $3000; Apple Watch also starts at ~$300 and its fitness-focussed Ultra 2 is $1200). “Apple is still playing catch up with Garmin for running. Even with the [recent software] update, I don’t believe Apple has equivalents for Garmin’s Training Readiness, Body Battery, Race Predictor, or Daily Suggested Workouts to name a few.” “Even with all of Apple’s new updates, the big issue is still battery. You're going to be logging some substantial miles and I hated always having to make sure I had enough juice to make it through my run at the end of the day. 13-15% left on my Garmin and I can still make it a whole day.” [Note: Garmin’s highest-end watches can last up to a month with solar charging; the Apple Watch Ultra 2 lasts up to 3 days] For fitness enthusiasts, Garmin is just a much-more focussed offering. The company’s success with watches is the best example of a more general theme: Garmin continually finds niches for GPS technology and spends a ton on R&D to invent products that appeal to high-value customers in each vertical (to give an idea of Garmin's business model, its operating margin of 28% is comparable to Ferrari; Apple is at 30% but also has a massive software business to complement its hardware). Let’s unpack this strategy more in the final section. People, it’s napkin math time. Using my very subpar spreadsheet skills, I pulled up the old Garmin 10-K filings and wanted to see if the company’s R&D bonafides are reflected in the hard numbers. Here are the stats: Since 2000, Garmin’s R&D staff has averaged 26% of all full-time employees (one study from the National Science Foundation found that R&D typically made up 6%-12% of staff depending on industry and size). From 2000-2023, Garmin’s R&D spend has averaged 12% of sales. But — BUT — there was a clear trend after the iPhone/Google Maps double whammy: from 2000-2008, R&D averaged 7% of sales but since then R&D has been 14% of sales (the same splits for R&D staff is 21% of all employees from 2000-08 to 29% of all employees in the 15+ years since). In sum: Garmin clearly went hard on R&D when it realized its car GPS navigation device cash cow was toast. Instead of milking whatever business it could and cutting costs, Garmin went on the offensive and has stayed on the offensive. As a point of comparison, Garmin’s R&D spend hitting 17% of sales in 2023 is significantly more than Apple and very competitive with the leading Big Tech firms: Meta (R&D spend is 27% of sales), Amazon (15%), Alphabet (14%), Nvidia (14%), Microsoft (12%) and Apple (8%). The fruits of Garmin’s R&D outlay isn’t just in the fitness division. A scroll through the website shows countless niche GPS products for automotive (dash-cams for trucking, motorbikes, RVs etc), outdoor (satellite comms, weather tracking, emergency messaging), nautical (fishing sonar, autopilot, radar mapping) and aviation (flight controls and touchscreens). The ramped-up R&D spend over the past decade has come under Garmin’s current CEO Clifton Pemble. He took over the top spot in 2013 when Min Kao retired. Kao remains Executive Chairman and is now worth $7B, one of America’s wealthiest self-made billionaires (Burrell left Garmin's management in 2002 and became Chairman Emeritus before passing away in 2019). While the co-founders are no longer in leadership positions, Garmin’s DNA has allowed it to successfully adapt to competitive threats. We’ve discussed the company’s engineering-first approach and emphasis on R&D. Kao highlighted some other notable corporate attributes in that 2012 Huffington Post interview: Fiscally conservative: “Gary and I both are fiscally conservative by nature, and we managed our company accordingly. Our early success bred more success. We reinvested in the company and established disciplines like having cash in the bank, maintaining sufficient inventory levels, and staying debt-free. Those practices helped avoid a lot of hurdles. We pioneered new products, new markets, and systems that integrated a variety of technologies which enabled us to supply complete glass cockpits to airplanes, full lines of electronics for boats and in-dash 'infotainment' systems for cars today. Our expansion into global markets, selling directly to consumers, happened quickly and relatively smoothly.” Deep relationships with original electronic manufactures (OEMs): “Our business to business development was much more challenging. Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) businesses in aviation, marine, and automotive industries all have very long development cycles, and a very strong tendency to stay with existing suppliers instead of seeking new partners. We persevered though, and over the years, we’ve developed deep relationships with some of the world’s leading OEMs, like Cessna, Embraer, BMW, and Chrysler.” Vertically-integrated: “From the beginning though, Gary and I believed in our business model of vertical integration — a philosophy that keeps all design, manufacturing, marketing and warehouse processes in-house. By doing so, we have been able to have greater control over timelines, quality and service. It might have been easier in the short term to offload many of these functions, but in the long run, we've learned that by controlling the entire process, we’ve had higher levels of innovation, reduced risks, lower costs, and greater scalability.” Cater to customer needs: “My partner, Gary, liked to say, 'we live and die by customers' perception of our products'. By concentrating on great products that delight customers, our brand takes care of itself.” [Side note: Garmin has also spent decades working in regulated industries such as aviation and cars, so the company understands the needs of regulators around privacy and sensitive data; this understanding helps it to port GPS-related technology from one regulated industry to another] So far, this foundation has worked for Garmin to survive Biggie Big Tech (iPhone/Google Maps and Apple Watch). It’ll have to keep drawing from this tradition because the competition is relentless and has a seeming endless appetite to take a dump on Garmin’s lawns. Example: last month, Garmin sold off after Apple announced that it would enable satellite communication in its smartwatches, a direct hit on Garmin’s various satellite outdoor devices. As Confucius Jeff Bezos once said, “One of the only ways to get out of a tight box, is to invent your way out.” This issue is brought to you by Bearly AI Why are you seeing this ad? Because all my efforts to create a GPS-enabled fitness device have failed. On that note, I co-founded an AI-powered research app called Bearly AI that can save you and your team hours of work with AI-powered tools for reading (instant summaries), writing (GPT-4o, Claude Opus 200K, Grok, Gemini) and speech-to-text transcription tools (Scribe, Whisper). It’s all available in one keyboard shortcut (and an iPhone app). Use code BEARLY1 for a FREE month of the Pro Plan. Try Bearly AI The Economist has a great article on why many of Europe’s top companies are Nordic, a region that has 0.3% of world’s population (~27m) but contributes 1% of the global GDP. Top names include: LEGO (Denmark): World’s largest toy maker by revenue (and largest reason I step on extremely painful indestructible plastic bricks in my son's room every morning). IKEA (Sweden): Largest furniture maker in the world and 6th largest restaurant chain thanks to the 1B+ Swedish meatballs it sells every year (you bet your ass I get double meatball every time I go to Ikea and then wash it down with the frozen yogurt and a hot dog). Novo Nordisk (Denmark): Ozempic creator and Europe’s most valuable company (perfect way to offset the Ikea meatballs). Klarna (Sweden): Biggest buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) firm in the world. Carlsberg (Denmark): The 6th largest brewer in the world. Spotify (Sweden): The world’s #1 music streamer. Rovio and Supercell (Finland): Leading mobile game developers (“Angry Birds”, “Clash of Clans”). The magazine cites 4 reasons for Nordic corporate success (and shockingly none of them involve a sauna): Internationalization: The Nordic market is small, so ambitious firms have to build for global markets (leading US firms generate 46% of revenue domestically; that figure is just 2% for leading Nordic firms). Early adopters of technology: LEGO famously rode the plastics revolution in the 1950s and IKEA innovated furniture with flat packing. Today, Nordic firms are faster to digitize than their European counterparts (eg. much higher cloud computing usage). Government policy: Personal tax rate is high but corporate tax is in line with America. High income taxes fund social safety net programs that help de-risk the entrepreneurial route (on that note: the Heritage Foundation ranks Denmark, Norway, Sweden in the top ten of countries worldwide for economic freedom). Patient shareholders: 4/5ths of “large Nordic companies have long-term ownership, compared with 3/5ths in Europe and only 1/5th in America”, which allows for long-term thinking (private business families — Ikea, LEGO, Maersk, Wallenbergs — are also prominent in region and stymie foreign takeovers) Nordic companies have obviously taken Ls (eg. recent collapse of battery maker Northvolt; previous clapping of Nokia by iPhone). But still impressive results! *** TikTok Ban (?): This TikTok situation is wild. I’m writing this on Friday morning and here is a catch-up: The US Supreme Court upheld a law that forces TikTok — which is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance (with the CCP on the company’s board) — to either sell the app or it will be banned in America on January 19th (Sunday). The Court determined that the app’s national security risks outweighed 1st Amendment Free Speech considerations. Functionally, a ban means that the iOS App Store and Google Play Store will stop allowing new downloads of the app and block updates (so the app will slowly degrade). TikTok said it would just shut down the app (from a PR perspective, this would make the most noise and get a groundswell of users being real PO’d). President Donald Trump takes office on January 20th and there is talk that he wants to give TikTok up to 90 days more to try to sell. There is reporting that the Chinese government — which is the ultimate decider — may allow Elon to buy TikTok. The price would be in the $50B-$100B range. This is very speculative. It’s not clear how financing would be done and whether an app sale would include the algorithm (which the Chinese government has previously said it would not sell). Prediction markets (Polymarket, Kalshi) have the probability of a full TikTok shutdown by May at 80%+. One data point for the other ~20% (aka Trump brokering a deal) is that the TikTok CEO has been invited to the Presidential Inauguration (to sit on the dais with other Big Tech CEOs). In a total hypothetical, Elon buying TikTok and combining it with X/xAI would immediately create a $100-200B company. I’ve been on the “US should ban TikTok” train for a long time and wrote about it here. The simplest argument is that having a geopolitical rival own a key communication channel is kind of absurd. During the Cold War, it would have been unfathomable for the Soviet Union to own ABC/CBS/NBC. TikTok's algorithm has been shown to boost pro-CCP and throttle anti-CCP content. Not to mention how basically every single foreign media and tech social platform is blocked in China. With over 150m+ users in the US, many creators (and related businesses) will definitely be impacted by the ban. But it’s worth noting that when India banned TikTok a few years back, most users quickly migrated to Instagram and YouTube and the disruption was short-lived. There have been a number of credible TikTok acquisition offers and the fact that the CCP won’t allow the sale — and is willing to incinerate $100B in value — is basically all you need to know about the app’s strategic significance. Since the situation is so fluid, there are definitely updates to come. In the meantime, here is a series of hysterical links related to the app’s upcoming ban. Specifically, I want to highlight a social app called Xiaohongshu, which translates to "RedNote" or really "Little Red Book" (the app’s founder says the name refers to the color of his alma-mater Stanford but it’s hard to miss the fact the “Little Red Book” is also the collection of Mao sayings that tens of millions of Chinese citizens had to memorize during the Cultural Revolution). Over the past week, 1m+ TikTok users — using hashtag #TikTokRefugees — have migrated to Little Red Book. This app is more comparable to Instagram/Pinterest, but TikTok-ers have gone to post there anyways. Some notable posts from this cultural exchange: Some legit wholesome cultural exchange. But also: American users trying to stick it to the US government by downloading a new Chinese app after the Supreme Court blocked another Chinese app, only to find that the new Chinese app severely represses speech on a number of topics. American male users trying to rizz local females (“ni hao hot shyt”). The CCP realizing that American users may spread foundational Western ideas (or, really, just complete brainrot viral trends) and telling the app to block Western posts from the rest of the app. American users helping Chinese users with English homework. Users on both TikTok and Little Red Book making jokes that they are “Chinese Spies”. One parody account of a "Chinese" user who will make you cry laughing (make sure you're sitting down for this one). Duolingo’s shares jumping +7% after a huge uptick in users trying to learn Mandarin and the company's X account posting this absolute gem: “oh so NOW you’re learning mandarin”. More to come next week, I’m sure! *** Some other links: “How Watch Duty’s wildfire tracking app became a crucial lifeline for LA” (The Verge) “Brad Pitt scammer who conned French woman out of £700,000 is tracked down in Nigeria... and revealed to be posing as another A-list star in new scam” (DailyMail) “David Lynch, Auteur Drawn to the Dark and the Dreamlike, Dies at 78” (The Hollywood Reporter) …and them fire posts (including me giving a shoutout to Atomic Habits author James Clear on New Year’s Day and him re-posting in acknowledgement that he’s locked down the “book you must buy for New Year Resolutions”): Finally, as many of you probably know, Zuck made a number of changes to Meta in recent weeks. The main thrust is that he’s dialling back Meta’s censorship regime including getting rid of third-party fact-checking (replacing it with X’s Community Notes system), moving content moderation teams from California to Texas (because of political bias in his view) and allowing people to cover topics previously throttled on Facebook, Instagram and Threads (trans, immigration and a lot of other political chatter). While he acknowledged that this could lead to more bad stuff on the platform, it also means that Meta won't be nuking millions of legitimate posts. Zuck Master Flex went on Rogan to explain his free speech stance and why he is making the changes (and someone left an amazing comment on the video: “Zuck looked at Jack Harlow and said, ‘yep, that’s my look now.’”). One reason was that the Biden administration was really pressing its thumb to censor speech and probably violating the 1st Amendment (particularly around COVID issues). Many critics note this looks like a cynical ploy to suck up to the incoming Trump administration. Yes, obviously it is. To wit: Zuck put Trump’s friend and UFC founder Dana White on the board and also made veteran Republican operator Joel Kaplan the head of Meta’s global policy team (replacing left-leaning Nick Clegg, the former Deputy PM of Britain). He also ended various DEI policies around hiring and vendor relationships. But also, Meta is a $1.5T company and it’s in his interest to have a productive relationship with government in power (especially with ongoing anti-trust cases). I do think Zuck’s position on allowing free-er speech has always been his preference. So, we'll see if he stays consistent. Either way, it basically took Elon changing Twitter/X and taking all the slings and arrows for two years — and then Trump getting re-elected — before Zuck felt he could make the move. With Zuck bringing the 3.5B users on all Meta platforms closer to X-style moderation after nearly a decade of extreme censorship pressure from government, NGOs and mainstream media to police the platform in the most Orwellian way possible…it’s pretty clear that Elon’s purchase of X was a true fork-in-the-road moment. I’ll write more on that but wanted to share memes from the funniest running joke of Meta’s pivot. On the Rogan podcast, Zuck — who has obviously been getting jacked and training MMA — said that corporate America needs to bring back “masculine energy”. And that it’s important to have the balance with feminine energy at the workplace. Anyway, here are some very related posts (including this first video clip): Without realizing I was an early adopter I bought the original Garmin watch in 2006 to replace my polar HR. I’ve since bought 4 more just because they were getting better though one might have failed. 2 years ago I talked to someone still using the original and happy with it. Says something for the quality. We also bought the GPS for the car but put it off too long and didn’t get much use before it was replaced with google but it did make a trip to France easier. I’ve added their scale and BP monitor so I can automatically keep it all in one app. Good marketing on their part. Great topic choice. I'm a longtime user/fan of their watches, precisely because they only do what they need to do. Also amazed by their survival/transition from the PND market (those were on every cabbie's dashboard. Oh wait...) to what they are today. Keep it up! No posts Ready for more?

We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) stands against the other AI stocks. In the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth. The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025. The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.

There are other reasons to invest in the stock as well, including solid fundamentals. As per the report of the third quarter of 2024, net income increased by $1,335 million from the third quarter of 2023, driven primarily by unrealized mark-to-market gains on derivative positions and the addition of Energy Harbor. In addition, the cash flow from operations was $1,702 million, indicating strong operational cash generation. The company has advanced its efforts in solar energy storage and nuclear by securing two power purchase agreements at new solar facilities, together totaling over 600 MW, with two of the world's leading tech companies – one for 200 MW with Amazon in Texas and one for 405 MW with Microsoft in Illinois. Moreover, the company plans to acquire the entire 15% minority interest in its Vistra Vision subsidiary, which will make Vistra the sole owner of its highly valuable, carbon-free assets. This acquisition will increase nuclear ownership by 970 MW and solar and energy storage ownership by 200 MW. Overall VST ranks 11th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of VST as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We recently published a list of 10 Must-Watch AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other must-watch AI stocks on investors’ radar. With everyone competing towards supremacy in artificial intelligence, the latest country to intensify its efforts has been Britain. As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence “superpower”. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers. READ ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors’ Radar Starmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade. “Britain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We’re going to make the breakthroughs, we’re going to create the wealth, and we’re going to make AI work for everyone in our country”. Another country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that “the world’s AI runs on American rails” and keep it out of the hands of “malicious actors” who could use it to threaten the United States. Even though the US government may think it’s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don’t necessarily agree. “In the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance”. Chipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not “mitigate any threat” but only “weaken America’s global competitiveness” and undermine its innovation. “By attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition—the lifeblood of innovation—the Biden Administration’s new rule threatens to squander America’s hard-won technological advantage”.

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), a multinational pharmaceutical company, saw its share prices on Friday retreat by 5.27 percent to finish at $78.69 after following news that the company’s blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss treatment Wegovy are among the 15 drugs targeted for Medicare price negotiations for 2027. A report said Friday that the negotiation process was in line with outgoing president Joe Biden’s signature Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, where 15 new drugs are set to undergo a negotiation process for being among the most expensive drugs. It can be learned that drug pricing concerns have already helped drag down the company’s valuation last year, alongside increasing competition for its blockbuster obesity and diabetes medicines. Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is a Denmark-based firm that owns drug brands such as Levemir, Tresiba, NovoLog, Novolin R, and Novolin N. Overall, NVO ranks 6th on our list of firms that took a hit on Friday. While we acknowledge the potential of NVO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: How a 'low performer' label makes things worse for laid-off workers
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/low-performer-label-meta-microsoft-layoffs-impact-recruiters-experts-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-18T16:48:15Z
Full Content:
Targeting "low performers" might seem like a logical tactic for big companies looking to streamline their workforces. But when Meta and Microsoft recently announced performance-based cuts, it sparked a debate online about the potential impacts of publicly labeling someone a "low performer" — a term loaded with negative connotations. Layoffs can already be traumatic for workers, and experts say such tags only compound the issue, creating new obstacles for those back on the job hunt. "Here's the real deal — a 'low performer' at Meta could be a rockstar anywhere else," Jan Tegze, a Czech Republic-based tech recruiter, wrote in a post on LinkedIn. But now, these "people have to job hunt with this label hanging over them. Every recruiter, every hiring manager will see these headlines." Jennifer Dulski, the founder and CEO of Rising Team and a management lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, said on LinkedIn that it was "reasonable to let people go for lower performance than others on the team, and to share that reasoning with them." "However, publicly branding employees as low performers serves no one — not the individuals, not the remaining team, and not the company's reputation," she added. "That will stick with and damage many people's careers. It's unnecessary and punitive," Jonathan Shottan, chief product and content officer at Tonal, said. Previous research has suggested that finding a job may be more difficult for laid-off workers due to the stigma they may encounter among potential employers. And with job seekers also facing a slowing job market and new hurdles such as the ever-expanding rollout of AI in workplaces, the added "low performer" tag may make the job search even trickier. Others have defended Meta and Microsoft's announcements, however. "Who would you fire? Your top performers?" One LinkedIn user wrote in response to Tegze's post. "There isn't a company in the world who would let go of anyone that they didn't think was their lowest performers." "What if.... they 'are' actually low performers," another said. "Stop jumping on the let's bash Zuk bandwagon." In an internal memo seen by Business Insider earlier this week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees that he had "decided to raise the bar on performance management" and act quickly to "move out low-performers." The cuts will affect 5% of the company's workforce, equivalent to about 3,600 roles. Microsoft has not announced the number of employees it plans to let go. For those who do find themselves caught in the layoffs, experts have some tips to help ensure they give themselves the best chance of getting back to work. Writing on X, Ethan Evans, a former Amazon vice president, advised those hit by cuts targeting low performers to carefully and openly explain their situation to hiring managers. Evans said it can be natural for recruiters to wonder if an interviewee has performance problems that they should avoid and that "your ability to respond calmly and confidently will matter just as much as the actual content of your answer." "If your entire team or division was cut, this is the strongest story. Be clear about that and say, 'My entire team was cut.' Point them to a news story that verifies your claim if you can," he said. He added: "Never badmouth your old boss or company." "Just like dating, no one wants to start a relationship with someone who isn't over their ex." Business Insider contacted Meta and Microsoft for comment. Jump to

Title: Why Is Cliff Asness Bullish On Broadcom Inc. (AVGO)?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness. The founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%. In his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis. Asness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following: “I’m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That’s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.” Following a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto. Despite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash. Our Methodology To make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. AQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $558.8 million One of the largest names in technology, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a strong presence in both the hardware and software sectors. The company's core strength lies in providing networking and custom chips for a number of different applications. Back on December 23, 2024, UBS increased its price target for Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to $270, up from $220, while maintaining a Buy rating. The updated artificial intelligence revenue forecasts for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 reflect roughly 20% and 40% in expected growth, respectively. This outlook was determined on the assumptions of a conservative market share, as well as anticipations around the expansion of the company's serviceable addressable market (SAM), as Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) gets ready to add two more hyperscaler clients for its AI offerings. For its fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 results, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $14.1 billion in revenue alongside an EPS of $1.42. The company's semiconductor division did incredibly well, generating about $8.2 billion in revenue driven by sustained AI demand. In comparison, the software segment didn't fare quite as well, generating $5.8 billion in revenue. Even so, the tech giant expects $14.6 billion in revenue, a 66% EBITDA margin, as well as an implied EPS of $1.51 for Q1 2025. On top of that, Broadcom counts on a sizable increase in XPU ASIC production during the second half of the year, powered by new 3nm products expected to deliver unit growth and higher average selling prices. Overall AVGO ranks 9th on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Somnium VR1 Price Increases Bring Base Model To €3000
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/somnium-vr1-price-increases/
Time Published: 2025-01-17T23:08:00Z
Full Content:
Somnium VR1, the European wide field of view PC VR headset, has just received a price increase for all three remaining variants, bringing the entry price to €3000. It comes two weeks after the company announced it had started shipping to the US, and simplified its lineup down from seven consumer variants to three. Somnium is a Czech startup previously solely focused on its social VR platform Somnium Space. But in late 2021 it announced the Somnium VR1 headset with a monster spec sheet for the time, in partnership with VRgineers - known for its ultra-high end XTAL headsets for enterprise. Originally Somnium VR1 was pitched as a hybrid headset with standalone capabilities via an onboard Snapdragon XR2 chipset, but that idea was ditched in 2022 to focus on making it a solely PC VR headset instead. VR1 uses the same 2880×2880 QD-LCD w/ Mini-LED panels used in Pimax Crystal. The displays have 20000:1 contrast via local dimming, 100% NTSC color gamut, and support 72Hz, 90Hz, and 120Hz refresh rate, with an "experimental" 144Hz mode available too. The output brightness to your eyes is 210 nits, around double that of Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro. Those displays are paired with large dual-element aspheric lenses Somnium claims deliver a field of view of around 130° horizontal and 105° vertical. That's wider than any other VR headset on the market. Pimax "5K" and "8K" were even wider, but are no longer in production and had significant distortion in the periphery. This focus on expanding field of view is why Somnium VR1 is so bulky in an era of far slimmer pancake lens headsets. Somnium says the price increases are due to production being "far more complex than initially anticipated". Specifically, the company is experiencing quality yield issues with its displays and lenses, requiring complex QA and rejecting some component stock. As for new VR1 orders placed today, Somnium says those will take one to two months to ship, and that it is "trying to accelerate production as fast as we can to meet the demand". Later this year, it plans to start selling spare parts for Somnium VR1 to enable self-repairs. We went hands-on with Somnium VR1 back in July.

Title: Amazon axes 200 jobs in Fashion and Fitness group in US: Report
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/amazon-axes-200-jobs-in-fashion-and-fitness-group-in-us-report-11737143832584.html
Time Published: 2025-01-17T20:12:45Z
Full Content:
Amazon is laying off around 200 employees in its Fashion and Fitness group in the US, Business Insider reported. The company confirmed the layoffs, which primarily impacted employees based in San Diego, a group known internally as F2. The decision follows a restructuring effort to optimize team structures for better innovation and customer focus. “We've adjusted parts of our North America Stores team because we believe this structure will better enable us to deliver on our priorities. As part of these changes, we've made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles, and we're committed to supporting affected employees through their transition.” The layoff decision is not connected to the discontinuation of its “Try Before You Buy” program, which allowed customers to try on clothing and footwear before making a purchase. The Try Before You Buy service, launched in 2018, was shuttered earlier this month. However, Amazon clarified that the program’s closure and the job cuts are separate. Amazon’s Fashion and Fitness group is responsible for curating and marketing apparel, footwear, accessories, and fitness equipment. The company continues to explore ways to expand its apparel and fashion categories, despite the challenges of customers often preferring to try items before purchasing. The layoffs signal ongoing internal adjustments in Amazon in a competitive market. Amazon is discontinuing its “Try Before You Buy” service, a program that allowed Prime members to try on select apparel, shoes, and accessories at home before completing their purchase. The company confirmed that the last day customers can place orders using the service will be January 31. The service, launched in 2018 after initial testing under the name Prime Wardrobe in 2017, enabled customers to order up to six clothing items for a trial period. After receiving the merchandise, shoppers had seven days to return any unwanted items without incurring charges. In a statement, Amazon explained that the decision was made due to the program’s limited reach and the increasing use of AI-powered tools to help customers select the right items. “Given the combination of Try Before You Buy only scaling to a limited number of items and customers increasingly using our new AI-powered features like virtual try-on, personalized size recommendations, review highlights, and improved size charts to make sure they find the right fit, we’re phasing out the Try Before You Buy option,” an Amazon spokesperson said.

Investing.com -- The Vanguard Group, Inc. has agreed to pay $106.41 million to settle charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over misleading statements related to capital gains distributions and tax consequences for retail investors. The funds in question are Vanguard Investor Target (NYSE:TGT) Retirement Funds (Investor TRFs) held in taxable accounts. The settlement amount will be distributed to affected investors. The SEC order, issued today, reveals that Vanguard had announced on December 11, 2020, that the minimum initial investment amount for Vanguard Institutional Target Retirement Funds (Institutional TRFs) was reduced from $100 million to $5 million. In the months following this announcement, a significant number of retirement plan investors moved their investments from Investor TRFs to the Institutional TRFs due to lower expenses. To meet the demand for these redemptions, the Investor TRFs had to sell underlying assets with gains, given the rising financial markets that had recovered from pandemic lows. As a result, retail investors in the Investor TRFs who did not switch and continued to hold their fund shares in taxable accounts faced larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities, thereby missing out on potential compounding growth of their investments. The SEC order also found that the prospectuses of Vanguard Investor TRFs, distributed in 2020 and 2021, were materially misleading. They stated that the funds’ distributions may be taxable as ordinary income or capital gains, and that capital gains distributions could vary significantly from year to year due to the funds’ “normal” investment activities and cash flows. However, the prospectuses did not disclose the potential for increased capital gains distributions resulting from the redemptions of fund shares by newly eligible investors switching from the Investor TRFs to the Institutional TRFs. The SEC order also found that Vanguard failed to adopt and implement written policies and procedures to prevent violations related to the accuracy of the funds’ disclosures. Corey Schuster, Chief of the Division of Enforcement’s Asset Management Unit, emphasized the importance of accurate information about capital gains and tax implications for investors saving for their retirements. He stated that firms must ensure that they accurately describe to investors the potential risks and consequences associated with their investments. The settlement resolves the SEC’s investigation and parallel investigations of Vanguard announced today by the Office of the New York Attorney General, the Connecticut Department of Banking, and the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General on behalf of the North American Securities Administrators Association. The SEC’s order finds that Vanguard violated the Advisers Act and caused violations of the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act. Vanguard has agreed to be censured, cease and desist from future violations, and pay $18.2 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. This payment will be deemed satisfied by the payment of $92.91 million in relief ordered by the states’ settlements and a $13.5 million civil penalty, for a total amount of $106.41 million to be distributed to affected investors through a Fair Fund. This amount is in addition to $40 million that Vanguard agreed to pay to settle an investor class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. If this settlement is terminated or rejected, the $40 million will be added to the Fair Fund. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s Magamorphosis Is Making Even More Sense Now

It’s becoming more and more difficult for Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s newly red-pilled CEO, to claim the rightward shift at his company reflects business as usual. According to a new report in The New York Times, Trump ally and surrogate Stephen Miller told Zuckerberg in December that the president-elect planned to go to war on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which the Meta chief has now axed just ahead of Trump taking office. At the same Mar-a-Lago meeting, the Times reported, Zuckerberg blamed Meta’s progressive culture on his “close friend” and former colleague, Sheryl Sandberg. Zuckerberg reportedly “signaled” to Miller and other senior Trump advisers “that he would do nothing to obstruct the Trump agenda,” according to the Times, and that in the coming months, his company would “focus solely on building tech products.” And as part of that shift, Zuckerberg reportedly added, Meta would soon announce layoffs and additional guidelines to “reset” the company’s culture. (Miller and Meta officials declined to comment to the Times.) All of those things have since come to pass, less than two months after Zuckerberg and Miller’s tête-à-tête. In addition to killing its DEI program—a move the company blamed on the shifting “policy landscape” in the US—Zuckerberg has downsized Meta’s moderation efforts, cancelled a nine-year fact-checking project and railed against the “neutering” of corporate culture on Joe Rogan’s podcast. On Wednesday, Meta also announced plans to cut five percent of its workforce, or roughly 3,600 people, though it’s not yet clear which teams will be impacted. The company’s long-time global policy chief, Nick Clegg, has already departed. The Times’ reporting sheds further light on Meta’s MAGAfication—and the larger, political realignment taking place inside Big Tech. While Silicon Valley has long served as a reliable stronghold for Democrats, many of its foremost leaders have lately cozied up to Trump and his administration. In addition to Zuckerberg, at least half a dozen prominent tech CEOs—including Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman—will attend Trump’s inauguration on Monday, Axios reported. They join Zuckerberg, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who will sit on the inaugural dais alongside the Trump family, Elon Musk and a host of other notables. Tech executives do potentially have much to gain from a friendship with Trump: During his first term, the president-elect showed apparent preference for companies that aligned with him. His deregulatory agenda could also benefit US tech firms, which chafed under departing President Joe Biden’s approach to antitrust law, artificial intelligence and the taxation of the ultrarich. In his farewell address on Wednesday, Biden warned about the rise of “a tech-industrial complex that could pose real dangers” to society. “Today,” Biden said, “an oligarchy is taking shape in America … that literally threatens our entire democracy.” Inside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s Big Business Ambitions, 5 Years After Their Royal Exit The Sex Abuse Scandal That’s Rocking an Elite Boarding School in the Berkshires Donald Trump’s First Orders of Business Infighting.

Title: Intel stock pops 8% because someone apparently wants to buy the troubled chipmaker

Time Published: 2025-01-17T17:02:00Z

Intel’s (INTC+2.93%) stock was up by more than 8% during late-morning trading on Friday after a report said the faltering chipmaker is being targeted for an acquisition. Tech newsletter SemiAccurate reported on Friday that it “was read an email about a company trying to acquire Intel, whole.” The email “took months to confirm,” SemiAccurate said, and indicated that the unnamed company aims to buy Intel’s whole business, not only parts. “Our problem was that while we knew the email was real and it said directly that the company was interested acquiring Intel, we couldn’t determine if it was a plan of action or just a CEO tossing ideas out,” SemiAccurate said. The embattled chip pioneer has seen its shares fall by around 54% in the past year. In December, Intel announced that its former chief executive Pat Gelsinger was retiring and stepping down from its board of directors. Gelsinger’s departure came amid Intel’s struggle to compete with other chipmakers such as Nvidia (NVDA+2.74%), which has seen an astronomical rise from the artificial intelligence boom. Intel’s shares fell 27% in August after it missed revenue expectations for the second quarter and announced layoffs. The company missed profit expectations partly due to Intel’s decision to “more quickly ramp” its Core Ultra artificial intelligence CPUs, or core processing units, that can handle AI applications, Gelsinger said on the company’s earnings call. In September, a report said chipmaker Qualcomm was interested in buying some of Intel’s chip design units. Intel has also worked with its longtime investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS-1.48%) and Goldman Sachs (GS-0.03%) on options to save its business, including by splitting its foundry division, which designs and manufactures chips, cutting factory projects, and M&A, according to Bloomberg. The company was reportedly also in talks with alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO+1.29%) for a $5 billion investment. Meanwhile, Intel was awarded up to $7.87 billion in direct funding in November under the Chips Act. The funding will directly support Intel’s nearly $90 billion planned investment in the U.S. by the end of the decade — part a more than $100 billion expansion plan for fabrication and advanced packaging facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon.

Wall Street closed higher on Friday, pushing stocks to their first weekly advance this year, ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House. President-elect Trump's inauguration is Monday, and his first days are expected to be filled with a flurry of executive orders. "Reports suggest 100 or more," wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a report. Any signals of how Trump's proposed tariffs would be implemented would be carefully watched, they said. Morgan Stanley economists still think the Federal Reserve could lower interest rates at its March policy meeting after cooler inflation data earlier this week, but noted "sooner and higher-than-expected tariffs can take March off of the table." Bitcoin gained 4.95%, closing in on $105,000, in anticipation of a possible first day order by Trump. It was last at $104,949 on reports that Trump could release an executive order making crypto a national priority as soon as his new term begins. Crypto-related shares like Coinbase and Robinhood rose, too." The broad S&P 500 index closed up 1% at 5,996.71; the blue-chip Dow gained 0,77%, rising to 43,487.52; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 1.51% to 19,630.20. Shares of social media giants Facebook and Instagram owner Meta and YouTube parent Alphabet advanced after the Supreme Court upheld a law that could ban TikTok if its Chinese parent company doesn't sell it. Trump reportedly is considering an executive order to stop the ban. Meanwhile, Meta and Alphabet closed higher because they may be among the companies that could benefit from a TikTok ban, analysts said. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield firmed to 4.615%. U.S. stocks notched their first weekly gain this year, with the S&P 500 and Dow logging their biggest weekly gains since November. The Nasdaq put in its best week since December. "The U.S. macro backdrop at the moment, at least per December’s data, is one that points to the ‘best of all worlds’ – higher employment, falling core inflation (which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors), and a strong consumer," said Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, which offers trading services. "Not a bad inheritance for President-elect Trump to pick up on Monday." On Friday morning, December industrial production and capacity utilization both easily beat expectations. Industrial production, which measures factory output, rose 0.9% and capacity utilization, which measures how efficiently resources are used, improved to 77.6%. On a technical basis, stocks also look bullish, said Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist for Blue Chip Daily Trend Report. So-called sentiment indicators -- bullish or bearish -- at extreme levels are "fairly reliable contrarian indicators," Tentarelli said, and bullish sentiment for stocks currently is at the lowest level since the November 2023 major S&P 500 lows in November 2023. This should bode well for stocks, he said. "Investors tend to be most bullish at market highs and most bearish near market lows," he said. Corporate news continues to garner attention.

Title: Goldman Sachs boosts David Solomon's pay 25% — and offers a sweet stock deal to remain CEO

Goldman Sachs (GS-0.06%) is locking in CEO David Solomon for at least another five years with a sweet stock deal — along with a big, annual pay increase. The investment bank is offering Solomon 130,508 restricted stock units, valued at $80 million, with a five-year vesting period, Goldman disclosed in a regulatory filing dated Thursday. President and chief operating officer John Waldron — considered Solomon’s leading successor — received the same retention package. These so-called retention grants or RSUs are a sign that the firm plans to hold onto their executives, at least for the duration of the vesting period. That’s on top of the $39 million total compensation package given to Solomon for 2024, up a hefty 25.8% from $31 million in 2023. That puts Solomon’s pay up there with leaders at other top banks, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM+1.50%) CEO Jamie Dimon, who received a $36 million compensation package in 2023, and former Morgan Stanley (MS-1.51%) CEO James Gorman, who made $37 million in his last year with the firm. Other Wall Street banks have not yet disclosed their CEO compensation for the 2024 fiscal year. Goldman attributed the pay bump to the firm’s strong performance last year, including a “significant year-over-year improvement as a result of strategic execution.” The firm also pointed to a “48% increase in stock price, a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend and 7% book value per share growth, resulting in record amount of capital returned to common shareholders in 2024.” Goldman reported Wednesday that it saw $13.87 billion in net revenues for the three months ended Dec. 31, a 23% year-over-year jump. Profit more than doubled to $4.11 billion, for the fourth quarter, from $2.01 billion a year ago. For the full year, Goldman brought in net revenues of $53.51 billion and net earnings of $14.28 billion. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: More Tech Pink Slips: Microsoft Lays Off Employees from Multiple Divisions Including Gaming

Microsoft has reportedly begun laying off employees in several key divisions, including security, sales, gaming, and devices. Business Insider reports that Microsoft, the tech giant known for its increasingly common security breaches and intimate relationship with China, is undergoing a round of layoffs that span multiple departments within the company. According to two people familiar with the matter, the job cuts are impacting teams in the security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming divisions. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed that the layoffs were small in scale but did not provide specific numbers. The spokesperson also emphasized that these layoffs are separate from the recent job cuts targeting underperforming employees across the company. One of the individuals with knowledge of the situation revealed that employees in Microsoft’s security unit began receiving notifications about the layoffs on Tuesday. The security division is led by Charlie Bell, a former top cloud executive at Amazon who made a surprising move to Microsoft in 2021 to spearhead a revamped cybersecurity effort. Microsoft has been placing a strong emphasis on security in recent years, particularly after facing a series of security issues, including what the Department of Homeland Security described as “a cascade of security failures” that allowed Chinese hackers to access emails from thousands of customers. In response, the company expanded its Secure Future Initiative last year, making security the top priority for all employees. The initiative was reinforced by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in an email to employees, stating, “If you’re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do security.” The layoffs in the security division raise questions about the company’s ongoing commitment to prioritizing security and addressing past vulnerabilities. It remains to be seen how these job cuts will impact Microsoft’s overall security strategy and its ability to deliver on the promises made through the Secure Future Initiative. In addition to the security team, the layoffs are also affecting employees in the experiences and devices, sales, and gaming divisions. These departments play crucial roles in Microsoft’s product development, customer relationships, and entertainment offerings. The extent of the impact on these teams and the specific roles affected have not been disclosed. Read more at Business Insider here.

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The e-commerce giant said it is cutting a small number of roles after a routine evaluation of its team structures and ability to “move fast.” Amazon has eliminated roles across its retail team in North America, impacting about 200 people in both physical store and e-commerce operations, the company confirmed Thursday. The cuts are being made as part of the company’s regular evaluation of its team structures “to ensure we’re best set up to move fast as we innovate for customers,” according to an Amazon spokesperson. “We’ve adjusted parts of our North America Stores team because we believe this structure will better enable us to deliver on our priorities,” the spokesperson said by email. “As part of these changes, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles, and we’re committed to supporting affected employees through their transition.” This downsizing is unrelated to Amazon’s decision to end its Try Before You Buy program, a service that allows a trial period for certain apparel, footwear and accessories. In that case, the company said that more people are increasingly using tech that allows them to get a sense of how items fit before they place an order. Last year the e-commerce giant also announced layoffs in its retail division. In January 2024 that included several hundred roles in its Alexa team and several others in its Buy With Prime team. The previous year the company announced more substantial job cuts, also mostly in retail. Overall in the industry, job cuts spiked last month, although retailers are also still hiring, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

A fashion mogul has gained more wealth this year than Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, or anyone else on the global rich list. Bernard Arnault, the founder and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has become about $14 billion richer already in 2025, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He leapfrogged Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison on Thursday to take fourth place on Bloomberg's rich list with an estimated $190 billion fortune, adding $15 billion to his net worth in just one day. The luxury tycoon has gained more wealth this year than Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who was up nearly $12 billion at Thursday's market close, and the "Donald of Dubai" Hussain Sajwani, up around $10 billion. Zuckerberg and Musk are the next-biggest gainers. The Meta and Tesla CEOs have added around $9 billion and $7 billion to their respective fortunes in just over two weeks, respectively. Arnault's net worth soared on Thursday as LVMH stock surged 9% to close at its highest price since September. Arnault owns about 48% of the luxury conglomerate, which houses around 75 brands, including Tiffany & Co, Dom Perignon, and Sephora. The shares jumped on hopes of a rebound in luxury demand after rival Richemont — the owner of brands like Cartier and Chloé — reported record quarterly sales with around 20% growth across Europe, the Americas, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa. Consumer appetite for pricey products came roaring back after the pandemic as people resumed traveling and shopping again. But the luxury business has struggled more recently as brisk inflation, higher interest rates, and economic fears have dampened demand even among well-heeled buyers. Arnault, nicknamed the "Wolf in Cashmere," was ranked as the world's richest person last March with a $230 billion-plus fortune, but his net worth shrank by over $50 billion by December as LVMH stock tumbled. Despite his latest gains, Arnault is still less than half as wealthy as Musk, worth $439 billion. Even accounting for Arnault's wealth decline, the world's 10 richest people added more than $500 billion to their combined fortunes in 2024, boosting their total worth to over $2 trillion. The group benefited from the buzz around artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts, an improved US economic outlook, and hopes that Donald Trump's planned tax cuts and deregulation as president will boost corporate profits.

[+] Merck (NYSE: MRK) logo seen displayed on a smartphone with an Artificial intelligence (AI) chip and symbol in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Merck stock (NYSE: MRK) lost about 10% in 2024, underperforming the broader S&P 500 index, which gained 23% for the year. Despite strong performances from other pharmaceutical giants like Eli Lilly stock (up 31%) and AbbVie stock(up 15%), Merck’s stock performance has been muted. This is attributed to declining sales of its blockbuster HPV vaccine – Gardasil – and an increased competition for some of its drugs, including Januvia. As an aside, new gaming products can be impactful. See Will New Switch Give A Boost To Nintendo Stock? In this note, while we briefly touch upon Merck’s performance in 2024, we focus on the impact on MRK stock and how 2025 could turn out. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Three trends were clearly visible for Merck in 2024. Firstly, the cash cow – Keytruda – continued to gain market share with approval in more indications. Keytruda’s last twelve-month sales now stand at a whopping $28 billion, compared to $25 billion in 2023. Secondly, the next best-selling product – Gardasil – faced headwinds in China, resulting in its sales falling in the recent quarters. The last-twelve month period sales of $9 billion align with the figure reported in 2023. This comes after a stellar 31.5% annual average growth rate Gardasil posted in the last three years. A crackdown on the healthcare industry in China has impacted on the overall vaccination rate in China. Lastly, it saw an improvement in gross margins, thanks to lower royalty rates for Keytruda and Gardasil. 2024 was also the year where Merck looked at inorganic growth to expand its pharmaceuticals and animal health business. It acquired Elanco’s aqua business for $1.3 billion, Harpoon Therapeutics for $680 million, LaNova Medicines for $588 million, Curon for $750 million, and EyeBio for $1.3 billion, among others. Merck may continue to eye inorganic growth to combat with the fall in sales, when Keytruda sees biosimilar competition (likely in 2029). It will be a massive gap to bridge, given that Keytruda is one of the top-selling drugs globally. MRK stock declined gradually from levels of $110 in early January last year to $99 by the end of 2024. Looking at a slightly longer term, the increase in MRK stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent and has largely been as volatile as the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 2% in 2021, 49% in 2022, 1% in 2023, and -6% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could MRK face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2023, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? We estimate Merck’s Valuation to be $130 per share, reflecting a 30% upside from its current market price of $100. At its current levels, MRK stock is trading at 4x trailing revenues, compared to the stock’s average P/S ratio of 4.5x over the last three years. 2025 is likely going to be better for Merck. Keytruda is expected to continue to lead the growth, with its approval for more indications lately. However, Gardasil’s decline in China may continue to weigh on the company’s vaccine sales in 2025. Merck’s diabetes drugs – Januvia and Janumet – are likely to see increased competition. The company’s animal health business is likely to benefit from increased pet ownership in the U.S. We expect the company to maintain its higher gross margins on the back of better product mix. Merck may also secure the regulatory approval for clesrovimab – an antibody for RSV treatment in infants. If approved, clesrovimab has the potential to garner $4 billion in annual peak sales. The U.S. FDA has set a deadline of June 10 to make a decision on approval of clesrovimab. Overall, MRK stock looks like it will have more positives to aid it in 2025. With its stock trading at 4x trailing revenues, we think the potential headwinds for Gardasil are largely priced in. While MRK stock looks like it can see higher levels, it is helpful to see how Merck’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped on Friday amid a tech stock revival as investors assessed a week of key data and earnings reports alongside potential policy shifts under a Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks posted big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. The Dow finished up 3.7 for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Housing starts climbed faster than forecast in December, and US industrial production outstripped estimates. The data out Friday added to a picture of strength in the US economy, buoying rate optimism. Meanwhile, techs were staging a comeback, with Apple (AAPL) stock up 0.7% in afternoon trading after booking its worst loss since August. Chipmakers such as Micron (MU) joined Nvidia in making gains, while Coinbase (COIN) was among crypto-linked names getting a boost as bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its advance above $100,000. Minds are also on potential policy upheaval on the last day of trading before Donald Trump begins his second term as president. Fears are that his plans for tariffs, taxes, and debt — as aired by Treasury pick Scott Bessent on Thursday — could inflame inflation. Inauguration day is Monday, when markets will be closed to mark the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. China's economy, an adversary for Trump, grew more than expected last year, topping Beijing's 5% target after a stimulus blitz. But Asia stocks lost ground on Friday as investors weigh the potential hit from promised hefty tariffs. The major gauges rallied on Friday and for the week, led by a tech stock resurgence and a shifting mood on Wall Street ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares were among the biggest players to shift back into the green. The Dow finished up 3.7% for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Markets have turned upbeat as investors have celebrated earnings from big banks and absord fresh inflation readings that signal the Fed continues to make progress in curbing pricing pressures, resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts in the months ahed After the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Wall Street will kickstart a whole new era as Trump ascends to the White House for the second time. Market sentiment has improved from a sour mood in recent weeks, instead clinging to a rosier interest rate outlook, muscular corporate earnings, and the expected policy changes that President-elect Trump hopes will lead to a cycle of growth for the US economy. A raft of corporate results will fill up the calendar next week, with big names like Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) set to report. Major airlines are also on deck. On the data front, a gauge of future US economic activity is set to be released on Wednesday, with the end of the week brining a fresh reading on consumer sentiment. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: The Tesla (TSLA) trade continues to reflect the ambitions and the passionate following of its singular CEO, Elon Musk. Tesla shares jumped roughly 6% Friday amid speculation that Musk could potentially buy TikTok. The short-form video app that has amassed a huge following in the US needs to find an American buyer, or it will effectively face a nationwide ban starting next week. “We believe ByteDance and ultimately Beijing is looking at the possibility that Musk/X could buy the US TikTok operations,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors. Tesla is also enjoying a broader rally in part thanks to Musk's alliance with President-elect Trump, who could potentially accelerate the EV company's plans to launch a fleet of robotaxis. Musk also co-leads a quasi-governmental position that aims to cut federal spending, which could also favor Musk's aspirations. Tesla's share price has surged around 75% since Election Day. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday that the investment adviser Vanguard will pay more than $100 million to settle charges for misleading statements related to its target-date retirement funds. The charges stem from a decision in late 2020 by Vanguard to lower the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds. After a substantial number of retirement plan investors switched from their investor plans to to the institutional plans, underlying assets had to be sold to meet the demand for theese redemptions. Retail investors who did not switch into the institutional target funds were hit with "historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," according to the SEC. Vanguard told Yahoo Finance in a statement that it is pleased to have reached this settlement. The settlement amount will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Bitcoin bulls are back in control Friday as the price of the dominant cryptocurrency shot above $100,000 and investors anticipated further action from President-elect Donald Trump to support the industry. Trump is expected to release an executive order prioritizing crypto policy during his early days in office, according to reports, as well as appoint business-friendly officials to oversee digital currency's continued rollout into the broader economy. In addition to cryptocurrencies rising in value, several corporate players tied to the ecosystem are rallying off the news. Coinbase (COIN), the nation's largest crypto trading platform, rose 5% Friday. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which continues to invest heavily in bitcoin, gained 7%. Trump has also expressed interest in creating a US crypto reserve, appointing a crypto czar, and implementing other regulations to drive adoption. The pro-growth approach contrasts with what was widely seen as an antagonistic relationship between the Biden administration and the crypto industry. The final trading day of the Biden era is heading for muscular gains Friday as optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and the policy changes that will follow, conicide with impressive corporate earnings and a rosier interest rate outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 1.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.2%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.7% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday. And the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday. META (META): Shares of the social media platform rose more than half a percent Friday morning following a decision from the US Supreme Court upholding the law that could see its rival, short-form video app TikTok, banned in the US. The TikTok ban would become effective this Sunday, Jan. 19, unless Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance divests from the platform. Novo Nordisk (NVO): The pharmaceutical company came under pressure after some of its medications were included in a list of Medicare price negotiations in 2027. Novo Nordisk's (NVO) GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, were among the names. Shares fell more than 4%. Intel (INTC): Shares of the embattled technology giant surged 8% Friday afternoon as speculation circulated online that the company has become an acquisition target, based on a report from SemiAccurate Friday. Intel stock has lost more than half its value over the past year. Coinbase (COIN): The nation's largest crypto platform is being buoyed once again by surging bitcoin prices. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) topped $100,000 again Friday following reports that President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its second round of drug negotiation targets, a list of 15 drugs under Medicare Part D, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) blockbuster GLP-1s, reports Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Novo was trading down 4% on the news Friday. Diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy top the list, along with a number of others like Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Janumet. Read more about the next round of drug price negotiations here. It is unclear if the incoming Trump administration will honor this list and the process or change it after taking office Jan. 20. Novo Nordisk currently has 55% of the GLP-1 market and has raked in $50 billion from the two drugs last year in the first three quarters alone. The US Supreme Court has upheld a law that bans TikTok in the US from Sunday unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, report Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley. The ruling on Friday creates new uncertainty for the Chinese app used by 170 million Americans, but could be a long-term boon for social-media rivals for ad dollars like Meta (META). The court sided with the US government’s argument that ties between TikTok’s parent ByteDance and Beijing presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold. TikTok had argued it was entitled to First Amendment protections and that its proprietary algorithm was in fact an editorial expression that qualified as speech. The court's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of Donald Trump, who promised to "save TikTok" and had asked the court to suspend the divestment deadline. The president-elect takes office on Jan. 20, a day after the ban goes into effect. Read more here. A tech stock revival drove a jump on Wall Street Friday as investors took in a week of favorable inflation readings and impressive corporate earnings, shifting market sentiment back toward optimism as the Federal Reserve considers its rate-setting policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.6% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to 4.6% on Friday. Housing starts rose in December, buoyed by a pickup in multifamily construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed that housing jumped 15.8% in December to an annual rate of 1.49 million, which was higher than economists' expectations for an annual rate of 1.32 million. Single-family starts had a modest advance. Construction rose 3.3% to an annualized rate of 1.05 million, the strongest pace since February 2024. Meanwhile, construction for multifamily dwellings grew by nearly 62%. “Housing starts soared at the end of the year, but this does not mean the country is out of the woods when it comes to the problems in the residential housing sector,” Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, wrote after the release. “There still is not enough housing in the country, and the construction of residential homes remains historically depressed,” the economist added. To this point, new construction in 2024 was the slowest it has been since 2019, per Bloomberg. Despite the rise in construction, builders are dealing with elevated mortgage rates. Freddie Mac said mortgage rates increased to 7.04% this week, hitting the highest since May 2024. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which had been climbing higher following strong employment data.

Markets have turned upbeat as investors have celebrated earnings from big banks and absord fresh inflation readings that signal the Fed continues to make progress in curbing pricing pressures, resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts in the months ahed After the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Wall Street will kickstart a whole new era as Trump ascends to the White House for the second time. Market sentiment has improved from a sour mood in recent weeks, instead clinging to a rosier interest rate outlook, muscular corporate earnings, and the expected policy changes that President-elect Trump hopes will lead to a cycle of growth for the US economy. A raft of corporate results will fill up the calendar next week, with big names like Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) set to report. Major airlines are also on deck. On the data front, a gauge of future US economic activity is set to be released on Wednesday, with the end of the week brining a fresh reading on consumer sentiment. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: The Tesla (TSLA) trade continues to reflect the ambitions and the passionate following of its singular CEO, Elon Musk. Tesla shares jumped roughly 6% Friday amid speculation that Musk could potentially buy TikTok. The short-form video app that has amassed a huge following in the US needs to find an American buyer, or it will effectively face a nationwide ban starting next week. “We believe ByteDance and ultimately Beijing is looking at the possibility that Musk/X could buy the US TikTok operations,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors. Tesla is also enjoying a broader rally in part thanks to Musk's alliance with President-elect Trump, who could potentially accelerate the EV company's plans to launch a fleet of robotaxis. Musk also co-leads a quasi-governmental position that aims to cut federal spending, which could also favor Musk's aspirations. Tesla's share price has surged around 75% since Election Day. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday that the investment adviser Vanguard will pay more than $100 million to settle charges for misleading statements related to its target-date retirement funds. The charges stem from a decision in late 2020 by Vanguard to lower the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds. After a substantial number of retirement plan investors switched from their investor plans to to the institutional plans, underlying assets had to be sold to meet the demand for theese redemptions. Retail investors who did not switch into the institutional target funds were hit with "historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," according to the SEC. Vanguard told Yahoo Finance in a statement that it is pleased to have reached this settlement. The settlement amount will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Bitcoin bulls are back in control Friday as the price of the dominant cryptocurrency shot above $100,000 and investors anticipated further action from President-elect Donald Trump to support the industry. Trump is expected to release an executive order prioritizing crypto policy during his early days in office, according to reports, as well as appoint business-friendly officials to oversee digital currency's continued rollout into the broader economy. In addition to cryptocurrencies rising in value, several corporate players tied to the ecosystem are rallying off the news. Coinbase (COIN), the nation's largest crypto trading platform, rose 5% Friday. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which continues to invest heavily in bitcoin, gained 7%. Trump has also expressed interest in creating a US crypto reserve, appointing a crypto czar, and implementing other regulations to drive adoption. The pro-growth approach contrasts with what was widely seen as an antagonistic relationship between the Biden administration and the crypto industry. The final trading day of the Biden era is heading for muscular gains Friday as optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and the policy changes that will follow, conicide with impressive corporate earnings and a rosier interest rate outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 1.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.2%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.7% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday. And the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday. META (META): Shares of the social media platform rose more than half a percent Friday morning following a decision from the US Supreme Court upholding the law that could see its rival, short-form video app TikTok, banned in the US. The TikTok ban would become effective this Sunday, Jan. 19, unless Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance divests from the platform. Novo Nordisk (NVO): The pharmaceutical company came under pressure after some of its medications were included in a list of Medicare price negotiations in 2027. Novo Nordisk's (NVO) GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, were among the names. Shares fell more than 4%. Intel (INTC): Shares of the embattled technology giant surged 8% Friday afternoon as speculation circulated online that the company has become an acquisition target, based on a report from SemiAccurate Friday. Intel stock has lost more than half its value over the past year. Coinbase (COIN): The nation's largest crypto platform is being buoyed once again by surging bitcoin prices. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) topped $100,000 again Friday following reports that President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its second round of drug negotiation targets, a list of 15 drugs under Medicare Part D, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) blockbuster GLP-1s, reports Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Novo was trading down 4% on the news Friday. Diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy top the list, along with a number of others like Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Janumet. Read more about the next round of drug price negotiations here. It is unclear if the incoming Trump administration will honor this list and the process or change it after taking office Jan. 20. Novo Nordisk currently has 55% of the GLP-1 market and has raked in $50 billion from the two drugs last year in the first three quarters alone. The US Supreme Court has upheld a law that bans TikTok in the US from Sunday unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, report Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley. The ruling on Friday creates new uncertainty for the Chinese app used by 170 million Americans, but could be a long-term boon for social-media rivals for ad dollars like Meta (META). The court sided with the US government’s argument that ties between TikTok’s parent ByteDance and Beijing presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold. TikTok had argued it was entitled to First Amendment protections and that its proprietary algorithm was in fact an editorial expression that qualified as speech. The court's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of Donald Trump, who promised to "save TikTok" and had asked the court to suspend the divestment deadline. The president-elect takes office on Jan. 20, a day after the ban goes into effect. Read more here. A tech stock revival drove a jump on Wall Street Friday as investors took in a week of favorable inflation readings and impressive corporate earnings, shifting market sentiment back toward optimism as the Federal Reserve considers its rate-setting policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.6% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to 4.6% on Friday. Housing starts rose in December, buoyed by a pickup in multifamily construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed that housing jumped 15.8% in December to an annual rate of 1.49 million, which was higher than economists' expectations for an annual rate of 1.32 million. Single-family starts had a modest advance. Construction rose 3.3% to an annualized rate of 1.05 million, the strongest pace since February 2024. Meanwhile, construction for multifamily dwellings grew by nearly 62%. “Housing starts soared at the end of the year, but this does not mean the country is out of the woods when it comes to the problems in the residential housing sector,” Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, wrote after the release. “There still is not enough housing in the country, and the construction of residential homes remains historically depressed,” the economist added. To this point, new construction in 2024 was the slowest it has been since 2019, per Bloomberg. Despite the rise in construction, builders are dealing with elevated mortgage rates. Freddie Mac said mortgage rates increased to 7.04% this week, hitting the highest since May 2024. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which had been climbing higher following strong employment data.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped on Friday amid a tech stock revival as investors assessed a week of key data and earnings reports alongside potential policy shifts under a Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts.

The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Housing starts climbed faster than forecast in December, and US industrial production outstripped estimates. The data out Friday added to a picture of strength in the US economy, buoying rate optimism. Meanwhile, techs were staging a comeback, with Apple (AAPL) stock up 0.7% in afternoon trading after booking its worst loss since August. Chipmakers such as Micron (MU) joined Nvidia in making gains, while Coinbase (COIN) was among crypto-linked names getting a boost as bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its advance above $100,000. Minds are also on potential policy upheaval on the last day of trading before Donald Trump begins his second term as president. Fears are that his plans for tariffs, taxes, and debt — as aired by Treasury pick Scott Bessent on Thursday — could inflame inflation. Inauguration day is Monday, when markets will be closed to mark the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. China's economy, an adversary for Trump, grew more than expected last year, topping Beijing's 5% target after a stimulus blitz. But Asia stocks lost ground on Friday as investors weigh the potential hit from promised hefty tariffs. The major gauges rallied on Friday and for the week, led by a tech stock resurgence and a shifting mood on Wall Street ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped on Friday amid a tech stock revival, as investors assessed a week of key data and earnings reports and eyed likely policy shifts under a Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.6% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Housing starts climbed faster than forecast in December, and US industrial production outstripped estimates. The data out Friday added to a picture of strength in the US economy, buoying rate optimism. Meanwhile, techs were staging a comeback, with Apple (AAPL) stock up slightly in morning trading after booking its worst loss since August. Chipmakers such as Micron (MU) joined Nvidia in making gains, while Coinbase (COIN) was among crypto-linked names getting a boost as bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its advance above $100,000. Minds are also on potential policy upheaval on the last day of trading before Donald Trump begins his second term as president. Fears are that his plans for tariffs, taxes, and debt — as aired by Treasury pick Scott Bessent on Thursday — could inflame inflation. Inauguration day is Monday, when markets will be closed to mark the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. China's economy, an adversary for Trump, grew more than expected last year, topping Beijing's 5% target after a stimulus blitz. But Asia stocks lost ground on Friday as investors weigh the potential hit from promised hefty tariffs.

Title: Americans keep swiping: Users scramble onto rival apps before TikTok's sell-or-ban deadline

Happy Friday! Not a great way to start the weekend, but important nonetheless: A new report detailed the alarming rise in cancer among women under 65. While breast cancer remains the biggest risk, lung cancer cases are on the rise. In today's big story, time is running out for TikTok as its sell-or-ban deadline is just days away. What's on deck Markets: When it comes to your 2025 investing strategy, size shouldn't matter. Tech: Meta's aggressive approach to underperformers is a nod to Amazon's playbook. Business: Streamlining. Rightsizing. Reduction of force. Companies are using confusing language to disguise job cuts. But first, we can't keep swiping. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. TikTok's For You Page might soon be for no one. The social media platform is days away from a shutdown in the US thanks to a divest-or-ban law passed back in April. Or is it? To quickly recap: A law requires ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, to sell its US operations to a non-Chinese owner by Sunday. However, anything beyond the above statement is unclear, as Business Insider's Peter Kafka explains. There is some murkiness and conflicting reports on everything from how the law will be enforced to what will happen to TikTok if it isn't sold and the app's potential workarounds. Peter broke down all the possible scenarios. Two central figures in the TikTok saga are the Supreme Court and President-elect Donald Trump. With the former, TikTok argued the law violates the First Amendment. (Give me mindless day-in-the-life videos, or give me death.) However, legal experts told BI the app's argument might not have been good enough to get the highest court in the land to step in. Then there's Trump. Despite having once backed a TikTok ban, the incoming president has done a 180. He's now much more supportive of the app, even inviting CEO Shou Chew to attend his inauguration. Some Democratic lawmakers are cheering Trump on regarding his TikTok efforts. But as Peter points out, there are still questions about what Trump could do, even as president, to prevent the ban. In the meantime, the world keeps swiping. One way or another. Americans are proving stubborn, resourceful, or a combination of both as they look to scratch their social-media itch. RedNote, which is basically China's version of Instagram, is surging in popularity in the US. The irony is Americans are essentially thumbing their nose at the US government by jumping to another Chinese-owned app, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. RedNote has become so popular that Duolingo told BI it's seen 216% growth in new Mandarin learners in the US. If TikTok truly is gone for good starting Sunday, there could be more US winners as users continue to look for a new home. And wherever the self-anointed "TikTok refugees" land, the ad dollars could follow. Some familiar names could just gobble back up more business, according to Wall Street analysts, but emerging platforms like Reddit and Trade Desk might also stand to benefit, writes BI's Kelly Cloonan. As for content creators who have built businesses on TikTok, it's another lesson in the importance of diversification. 1. America's economic exceptionalism isn't going anywhere. If you're wondering whether US market dominance peaked in 2024 — when US GDP neared $30 trillion and dwarfed both the Eurozone and China — the answer is no. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs both urged investors to bet on the red, white, and blue this year. 2. Dutch Bros, Tempur-Sealy, and Mattel make the cut. UBS made its case for small and mid caps, with analysts pointing out how smaller firms outdid their larger peers by 2% per year in the long term. Interest-rate cuts aren't on the forecast after last month's knockout jobs report, but UBS still had some top picks for smaller stocks to buy. 3. Six shocks that could shake up markets in 2025. It's hard to predict surprises, but that doesn't stop some strategists from trying. From a global internet outage to another year of 20% stock gains, here are the curveballs Bank of America thinks could rattle investors. 1. The Musk-Bezos space race. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin successfully sent its New Glenn rocket into orbit on Thursday. Its competitor SpaceX ran its seventh Starship launch later that day, but the mega-rocket unexpectedly dropped out of communications and exploded after liftoff. Pressure is mounting on both Bezos and Musk, as they prepare for Trump's White House return. 2. Amazon's RTO headaches. The company's five-day return-to-office mandate is off to a bumpy start thanks to a shortage of office space. Some employees told BI the rollout was riddled with issues like a lack of desks and meeting rooms, and workplace theft. Plus, they're still on video chats. 3. The times, they are a-changin' — and Big Tech workers pay the price. Meta and Microsoft are embracing Amazon's brutal management style, prioritizing lean, high-performing teams over employee retention. "The overarching trend is that corporations feel they have more power over their employees," one former Googler told BI. 1. Nonregrettable attrition (noun): a euphemistic term for layoffs. Many companies go out of their way to avoid calling job cuts what they are. But whether it's "rightsizing," "streamlining," or Meta's recent buzzphrase "nonregrettable attrition," the corporate lingo of job cuts doesn't soften the blow to employees. 2. Justin Baldoni sues Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, claiming $400 million in damages. The "It Ends With Us" director filed a 179-page suit on Thursday, accusing his costar of hijacking the movie and destroying his reputation. Lively previously accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and of trying to smear her in the press, claims that Baldoni has denied. 3. All the lonely (young) people. Gen Z adults are the loneliest and least optimistic generation, a new survey found. It's not just about young Americans having fewer social connections. More time alone and young people getting married later are also factors. Boomers, on the other hand, are on a different wavelength. The 10 safest states to live in the US, ranked.

Title: Ozempic could get cheaper as Medicare eyes drug price negotiations — and Novo Nordisk stock slips
URL: https://qz.com/wegovy-ozempic-drug-price-talks-novo-nordisk-medicare-1851741842
Time Published: 2025-01-17T14:13:00Z

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) said Friday that it had selected another 15 drugs for its second round of price negotiations, including the popular weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Negotiations between the federal government and drugmakers are slated to occur in 2025, with any new prices set to take effect in 2027. Pharmaceutical companies have until Feb. 25 to decide if they will participate in negotiations. Along with Wegovy and Ozempic, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has tapped Xtandi, Ibrance, Calquence, and Pomalyst, which are used to treat various types of cancer, for price negotiations. Otezla, a psoriasis medicine; Vraylar, an antipsychotic.; and Trelegy Ellipta, an inhaler used to treat emphysema and asthma, were also picked. According to the CMS, the drugs selected were used by 5.3 million people with coverage under Medicare Part D between November 2023 and October 2024 to treat conditions such as cancer and type 2 diabetes. They also accounted for about $41 billion in total gross covered under Medicare Part D, or about 14% of all costs, during that time period. “Last year, we proved that negotiating for lower drug prices works,” Xavier Becerra, the outgoing head of HHS, said in a statement. “Now we plan to build on that record by negotiating for lower prices for 15 additional important drugs for seniors.” The Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed by Congress in 2022, allowed the CMS to negotiate the price for brand name drugs that make up most of Medicare’s prescription drug spending. HHS in August announced lowered prices of the first 10 prescription drugs that underwent Medicare negotiations. The selected drugs accounted for $56.2 billion in total Medicare spending in 2023, according to HHS. The negotiations resulted in price discounts ranging from 38% to 79%. Read More: Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Novo Nordisk (NVO+2.82%), the company behind both Ozempic and Wegovy, had expected Ozempic to be included in the second round of price negotiations. Its drugs have become incredibly popular as Americans turn to GLP-1 medications to help them lose weight. Wegovy has also been approved for reducing heart risks like heart attacks and strokes, while studies have found these dugs can help with several other conditions. Novo Nordisk saw its stock fall by more than 4% in pre-market trading Friday. Shares are also being affected by headline results from a new study that found patients who take a higher dose of Wegovy lost more weight than those on a lower dose without experiencing an increase in side effects. The study found that people who took a 7.2-milligram dose lost an average of 20.7% of their weight over 72 weeks. Patients who took a 2.4-milligram dose of the semaglutide lost 17.5% of their weight, while people given a placebo lost just 2.4% of their weight over that time. Over 33% of participants who took the higher dose also recorded a weight loss of 25% or more, compared to 16.7% of participants with the lower dose. “We are very pleased to demonstrate 20.7% weight loss and to see that 33% of patients achieved more than 25% weight loss with semaglutide 7.2 mg, with a safety and tolerability profile comparable to semaglutide 2.4 mg,” Novo Nordisk’s head of development, Martin Holst Lange, said in a statement. — Bruce Gil contributed to this article.

January 17, 2025 07:11 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 17 January 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced headline results from STEP UP, a phase 3b trial in the global STEP programme. STEP UP is a 72-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous semaglutide 7.2 mg compared to semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo, all administered once weekly. The trial included 1,407 randomised adults with obesity. All treatment arms were in conjunction with lifestyle intervention. The trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior weight loss at week 72 with semaglutide 7.2 mg versus placebo. When evaluating the effects of treatment if all people adhered to treatment1 from a mean baseline body weight of 113 kg, people treated with semaglutide 7.2 mg achieved a superior weight loss of 20.7% after 72 weeks compared to a reduction of 17.5% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 2.4% with placebo. In addition, 33.2% of those who received semaglutide 7.2 mg achieved a weight loss of 25% or more after 72 weeks, compared to 16.7% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 0.0% with placebo. When applying the treatment policy estimand2, people treated with semaglutide 7.2 mg achieved a superior weight loss of 18.7% compared to a reduction of 15.6% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 3.9% with placebo. In the trial, semaglutide 7.2 mg appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time, consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. “We are very pleased to demonstrate 20.7% weight loss and to see that 33% of patients achieved more than 25% weight loss with semaglutide 7.2 mg, with a safety and tolerability profile comparable to semaglutide 2.4 mg,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “Results from STEP UP further strengthen the clinical profile of semaglutide for the treatment of obesity, in addition to the health benefits already established with Wegovy®, including cardiovascular risk reduction as seen in SELECT”. The results from the second semaglutide 7.2 mg phase 3 trial, STEP UP T2D, in adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity are expected within the next few months. Detailed results from the STEP UP trial are expected to be presented at a scientific conference in 2025. About the STEP UP trialsNovo Nordisk has initiated two trials investigating the efficacy of semaglutide 7.2mg, STEP UP and STEP UP T2D. The 72-week STEP UP trial was a randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, superiority trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of semaglutide 7.2 mg with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. 1,407 adults with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and without diabetes were included in the trial. The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of semaglutide 7.2 mg against placebo on weight loss. Key secondary endpoints included number of participants achieving 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% weight loss, respectively. The ongoing 72-week STEP UP T2D trial will investigate semaglutide 7.2 mg in 512 adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes, with the primary objective to demonstrate superiority of semaglutide 7.2 mg against placebo on weight loss. About Wegovy® (semaglutide 2.4 mg)Semaglutide 2.4 mg is marketed under the brand name Wegovy®. In the EU, Wegovy® is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adults with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obesity) or adults with a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition. In the EU, Wegovy® is also indicated for paediatric patients aged 12 years and older with an initial BMI at the 95th percentile or greater for age and gender (obesity) and body weight above 60 kg. The clinical section of the label also includes data showing the benefits of Wegovy® in reducing the risk of MACE, improving HFpEF-related symptoms and physical function, as well as reducing pain related to knee osteoarthritis. In the US, Wegovy® is indicated in combination with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity to reduce the risk of MACE in adults with established cardiovascular disease and either obesity or overweight, as well as to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adults and paediatric patients aged 12 years and older with obesity and in adults with overweight in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition.

Louis Carter: CEO of Best Practice Institute, creator of Most Loved Workplace®, author of Change Champions & In Great Company (McGraw Hill). When discussing drivers of stock performance, many factors come to mind—market conditions, financial performance and strategic communications, among others. However, even the most compelling good news doesn't always translate to stock price increases. A crucial yet often overlooked factor is what I call "leadership magnetism": the ability of a leader to build trust, emotional alignment and shared purpose with their stakeholders. Leadership magnetism refers to the gravitational pull a leader creates through their actions, behaviors and communications. It isn't about charisma or personality—it's about building authentic connections that attract, align and inspire stakeholders, from employees to investors. Leaders with strong magnetism can amplify the impact of strategic announcements, driving enthusiasm and financial returns. When leadership magnetism is weak, however, even breakthrough announcements can fail to move markets, as eroded trust dampens investor response. Research underscores the value of leadership magnetism in organizational success. A Weber Shandwick study found that executives attribute 44% of a company's market value to the CEO's reputation. Similarly, back in 2000, a Burson-Marsteller study revealed that 45% of a company's reputation directly stems from its CEO’s standing. These findings highlight how a leader’s ability to connect emotionally and strategically with stakeholders significantly influences market outcomes. Several notable cases demonstrate how weak leadership magnetism can undermine even the most promising strategic initiatives: • WeWork's Trajectory Under Adam Neumann: Despite announcing ambitious expansion plans in 2019, WeWork's valuation plummeted from $47 billion to less than $8 billion (subscription required). As documented by the Wall Street Journal, stakeholders lost confidence in Adam Neumann's leadership due to concerns about his decision-making and governance style. Bloomberg similarly detailed how mounting concerns about Neumann's transparency eroded investor confidence​ • Meta And Mark Zuckerberg's Metaverse Investment: In October 2021, Mark Zuckerberg announced a $10 billion investment in the metaverse alongside a company rebranding. However, Meta's stock price dropped, as ongoing privacy issues and ethical controversies diminished his leadership magnetism. • GE's Strategic Pivot Under Jeff Immelt: Between 2015 and 2017, GE's stock price declined from $30.66 to $23.16 as stakeholders questioned Jeff Immelt's ability to execute a digital transformation strategy. CEOs who master leadership magnetism can transform strategic announcements into powerful market catalysts: • Microsoft And Satya Nadella: Satya Nadella’s clear vision for AI-driven growth has been instrumental in Microsoft’s financial success. Under Nadella’s leadership, Microsoft reported in 2024 "over $245 billion in annual revenue, marking a 16% increase year-over-year, alongside a 24% jump in operating income to over $109 billion." These achievements underscore Nadella’s ability to inspire confidence and effectively communicate strategic priorities. • Tesla And Elon Musk: Elon Musk’s ability to rally stakeholders around Tesla’s mission "to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy" exemplifies leadership magnetism. Musk’s authenticity and mission-driven strategy have been credited as key factors in Tesla’s rise to market dominance, inspiring investor confidence and stakeholder loyalty (membership required). After two and a half decades working alongside, coaching and advising CEOs, I've observed three fundamental practices that build and sustain leadership magnetism: Leadership magnetism thrives when leaders tune into their organization's pulse, strengthen it and then move on it. Magnetic leaders have an innate sense of when to listen and when to move—gathering key insights swiftly, recognizing patterns that matter and then driving consistent messages that reflect shared aspirations. Take Satya Nadella, whose leadership at Microsoft exemplifies this approach, bringing teams into the vision-building process and ensuring alignment and commitment. Magnetic leaders use stakeholder feedback as their strategic radar, not a compliance exercise. Lisa Su of AMD demonstrates this perfectly: She consistently gathers input from employees and retail investors, using it to refine AMD's strategy and foster loyalty. Elon Musk has a rare quality among CEOs: He doesn't sugarcoat things, even in tough moments. Take his 2014 interview where he opened up about Tesla's early days. Instead of spinning a success story, he admitted what was really going through his head at the time: "I thought we would most likely fail." You don't often hear billionaire founders talk about doubt like that. It's this kind of raw honesty, especially when the stakes are high, that sets his leadership style apart. Leadership magnetism is not a fixed trait—it’s a skill that can be cultivated through intentional practices. By fostering collaboration, integrating feedback and acting authentically, leaders can create a magnetic pull that inspires, aligns and drives success. As markets grow more complex and stakeholder expectations evolve, leadership magnetism will become increasingly crucial. Tomorrow's successful leaders must master the delicate balance between strategic vision and authentic connection, technical excellence and emotional intelligence, bold action and stakeholder trust. The revolution in leadership valuation is already underway. Good news alone won't drive stock price increases if stakeholders don't trust or admire the CEO. Those who embrace the power of leadership magnetism will be best positioned to thrive in this new era of market dynamics.

Title: This Wall Street quant model ranks the best to worst Magnificent 7 stocks
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/this-wall-street-quant-model-ranks-the-best-to-worst-magnificent-7-stocks-3818582
Time Published: 2025-01-17T11:29:13Z

Investing.com -- Since 2020, the Magnificent 7 stocks have soared by an average of 640%, compared to approximately 100% for the S&P 500, now accounting for about 34% of the index's weight, analysts at Jefferies said in a note Friday. However, the firm highlighted that performance within the group has varied significantly, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) leading the pack. "Not all stocks have fared equally well," Jefferies notes, highlighting that "NVDA and TSLA lead the returns." Jefferies believes the average monthly return dispersion of 25% emphasizes the importance of stock picking within this elite group. Even the weakest performer, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), has risen about 140%, while NVDA surged approximately 2,200%. The Mag7 stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 in 38 of the last 60 months, achieving a 63% hit rate. Despite a challenging 2022 where the Mag7 dropped around 40% as the S&P 500 fell 20%, the group rebounded strongly in 2023, buoyed by robust earnings resilience. Jefferies notes that "revisions are far better for Mag7," suggesting their dominance isn't over yet, even if "the best of Mag7 returns may be behind us." Jefferies highlighted that its Mag7 model evaluates these stocks on various factors, including growth, revisions, sell-side sentiment, momentum, valuation, yield, return on invested capital (ROIC), and R&D versus capex. The backtest results are said to be compelling: “A monthly backtest for the past 5 years shows that the best-ranked stock had average monthly return of 5.8%, vs 3.4% for all Mag7 stocks, beating the equal-weighted cohort in 34 out of 60 months." “The lowest ranked stock in our model had a monthly average return of only 2.6%, creating a long-short monthly average of 3.1% (58% hit rate),” they added. Currently, "NVDA ranks the best in our model," said Jefferies, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as the best anti-momentum value play. Conversely, "MSFT ranks the lowest," while TSLA is noted as "the most volatile stock with extreme factor exposure."

Title: Microsoft’s Stock Revival Hinges on Showing Growth From AI Binge

(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful. Most Read from Bloomberg How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters What LA’s Fires Mean for the City’s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides The worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple. “The market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,” said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While “Microsoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.” The stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally. This reflects scrutiny on the firm’s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft’s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers. The next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one. Slower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. “Google Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot” or other services, according to Wedbush’s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft’s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini. Microsoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this “might be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.” On Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools. Even if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp. Bank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the “best positioned” for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications. Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook. “While AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,” she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. “Strong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.” Revenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years. The question is whether that’s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25. “AI adoption is the question on everyone’s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,” said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. “Some traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.” Tech Chart of the Day Apple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: UnitedHealth Stock Ails as Results Fall Short

Major U.S. equities indexes ticked lower on Thursday, failing to gain ground a day after soft inflation data and an upbeat start to earnings season helped drive a strong rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, ending a streak of three straight positive trading sessions. The Dow was also down 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares dropped 6.0%, posting the heaviest daily loss in the S&P 500, following the healthcare giant's first earnings release since last month's fatal shooting of insurance unit chief Brian Thompson. Although quarterly profits came in ahead of expectations, UnitedHealth reported lower-than-expected revenue. An increase in medical costs also contributed to a year-over-year uptick in the firm's medical cost ratio, which compares medical expenses to total revenue. Shares of US Bancorp (USB) plunged 5.6%. The move lower came after the financial services firm reported mixed quarterly results, topping adjusted profit estimates but falling short of forecasts for its net interest margin, a key measure of a bank's effectiveness in lending its capital. Texas Instruments (TXN) shares sank 5.1% after reports that China's Commerce Ministry is launching an investigation into the legality of U.S. subsidies for chipmakers that create competitive challenges for Chinese products. With a focus on lower-end semiconductors like power and analog chips, Texas Instruments could face repercussions if Chinese officials determine the company has violated anti-dumping regulations. Shares of Dexcom (DXCM), a manufacturer of glucose-monitoring devices for patients with diabetes, gained the most of any S&P 500 stock on Thursday, jumping 5.5%. Analysts at Piper Sandler highlighted several bullish catalysts for Dexcom, including a stable outlook for its durable medical equipment (DME) channel and the approval of reimbursement for 5 million patients with type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin. In addition, Baird analysts boosted their price target on Dexcom stock, noting improvements in salesforce productivity and growth potential in U.S. markets. JPMorgan boosted its price target on Estee Lauder (EL) stock, and shares of the makeup and skin-care specialist jumped 4.8%. Analysts said they expect this earnings season to be consequential for makers of household and personal-care products, with discussions about consumer behaviors, tariff risks, currency impacts, and interest-rate expectations likely to influence the 2025 industry outlook. Semiconductor equipment stocks advanced after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), issued strong fourth-quarter profit guidance. The world's largest contract chipmaker highlighted an upbeat outlook for artificial intelligence (AI) demand, which bodes well for sales of chip manufacturing gear, even as the Netherlands announced tightened export rules that could affect the industry. Shares of Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA Corp. (KLAC), and Lam Research (LRCX) shares gained 4.5%, 4.3%, and 4.0%, respectively.

The core retail business, which Amazon also refers to as its stores division, encompasses a wide range of divisions, including its private label brands, Prime membership program, and consumables business. "We've adjusted parts of our North America Stores team because we believe this structure will better enable us to deliver on our priorities," an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. "As part of these changes, we've made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles, and we're committed to supporting affected employees through their transition." The layoffs included employees in the fashion and fitness business, among others, the spokesperson said. Business Insider earlier reported on the job cuts. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has moved to rein in costs across the company, laying off about 27,000 employees since the beginning of 2022. The bulk of the job cuts came in 2022 and 2023, though they have been ongoing at a smaller scale, and have impacted almost every business across the company's portfolio. Amazon has also shuttered some of its more experimental and unprofitable initiatives, including its telehealth offering, a brick-and-mortar delivery program, and try-on service for clothing and shoes.

Title: 'Deeply Alarmed': Read the Letter WaPo Employees Sent to Jeff Bezos Demanding He Address Newsroom
URL: https://freebeacon.com/media/deeply-alarmed-read-the-letter-wapo-employees-sent-to-jeff-bezos-demanding-he-address-newsroom/
Time Published: 2025-01-16T20:00:59Z
Full Content:
The Washington Post’s White House bureau chief, congressional bureau chief, and lead fact-checker were among the signatories of a letter to owner Jeff Bezos complaining about the paper’s current leadership and pressing him to come to the newsroom for a sit-down with newsroom leaders, according to a copy of the document obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. The letter—a broadside against the paper’s leadership under publisher Will Lewis, whose push for political moderation has rankled many of the Post’s left-leaning employees—was first reported by NPR on Wednesday. But the names of the staffers who signed it have not previously been reported. Among the 432 signatories are White House Bureau Chief Toluse Olorunnipa, Congressional Bureau Chief Paul Kane, Senior Politics and Democracy Editor Griff Witte, and fact-checking columnist Glenn Kessler. Other prominent names include left-leaning columnists David Ignatius, Ruth Marcus, Karen Attiah, and Dana Milbank. The letter was also signed by the Post’s chief political correspondent Dan Balz, MAGA correspondent Isaac Arnsdorf, and White House reporter Yasmeen Abutaleb. The Post’s abortion correspondent Caroline Kitchener, Upper Midwest Democracy reporter Patrick Marley, and Climate Zeitgeist reporter Shannon Osaka signed the petition as well. The list of signers shows the growing discontent at the Post, which lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers after declining to endorse Kamala Harris in November. The paper also drew criticism from employees this month after scrapping a cartoon that took aim at owner Bezos. The petition—sent to Bezos on Tuesday—was circulated around the newsroom this week for signatures, along with an addendum note that said it was written by a "small, cross-desk group of reporters with input from across the newsroom," according to a copy obtained by the Free Beacon. The addendum urged employees to "sign this document immediately (even if you have already unofficially offered your support)" and added: "Please do not share this link or this letter with anyone outside The Post." In the letter to Bezos, employees said they were "deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave, with more departures imminent," according to a copy obtained by the Free Beacon. Staffers said their concerns go "far beyond the issue of the presidential endorsement, which we recognize as the owner’s prerogative." The letter urged Bezos to "come to our office and meet with Post leaders, as you have in the past, about what has been happening at The Post. We understand the need for change, and we are eager to deliver the news in innovative ways. But we need a clear vision we can believe in." A number of staffers have recently left the paper, including anti-Trump opinion writer Jen Rubin, while employees are reportedly bracing for a major round of layoffs. The Post has faced internal turmoil for months, with many staffers blaming Bezos and Lewis for the paper’s shift away from anti-Trump political activism. In October, the Free Beacon obtained audio from a tense meeting of the Post’s editorial team, where some of the writers bemoaned the paper’s decision to not publish a presidential endorsement and accused Bezos of political meddling and financial conflicts of interest. Just two days after the letter went to Bezos, on Thursday, the New York Times reported on a "new mission statement" at the Post meant to reflect "a more expansive view of The Post's journalism": "Riveting Storytelling for All of America." The Post, however, will not be ditching its more infamous slogan, "Democracy Dies in Darkness." The letter sent to Bezos and its signatories can be read in full below: Letter to Jeff Bezos Dear colleagues: We have drafted a letter to our owner, and we are seeking your support. The following letter was written by a small, cross-desk group of reporters with input from across the newsroom. This is a collective action of employees and managers, both Guild-covered and not. So far, more than 420 of you have signed your names. We sent this letter directly to Jeff Bezos on Tuesday evening but will continue to collect signatures and add names to this form. We urge you to sign this document immediately (even if you have already unofficially offered your support). Please do not share this link or this letter with anyone outside The Post. Note that small changes have been made from earlier versions. Let's fight for the paper we love. *** To Jeff Bezos: You recently wrote that ensuring the long-term success and editorial independence of this newspaper is essential. We agree, and we believe you take as much pride in The Washington Post as we do. We are deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave, with more departures imminent. This goes far beyond the issue of the presidential endorsement, which we recognize as the owner’s prerogative. This is about retaining our competitive edge, restoring trust that has been lost, and reestablishing a relationship with leadership based on open communication. We urge you to come to our office and meet with Post leaders, as you have in the past, about what has been happening at The Post. We understand the need for change, and we are eager to deliver the news in innovative ways. But we need a clear vision we can believe in. We are committed to pursuing independent journalism that holds power to account and to reporting the news without fear or favor. That will never change. Nothing will shake our determination to follow the reporting wherever it leads. As you wrote when you first became The Post’s owner in 2013, "The values of The Post do not need changing." We urge you to stand with us in reaffirming those values.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is advancing 5% after the huge, Taiwan-based chip manufacturer reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results today. A Look at TSM's Q4 Results and Statements The company's Q4 sales jumped 37% versus the same period a year earlier to $26.88 billion. That was $890 million above analysts' average estimate. Further, TSM's earnings per share rose to $2.24, compared with $1.44 in Q4 of 2023. Analysts, on average, had expected the firm's Q4 EPS to come in at $2.23. "With our strong technology leadership and differentiation, we are well-positioned to capture the multiyear structured demand from the industry megatrends of 5G, AI, and" high-performance computing (HPC)," CFO Wendell Huang asserted on the company's Q4 earnings call. HPC accounted for 53% of its Q4 revenue, versus 43% in Q4 of 2023. For Q1, the chip maker provided revenue guidance of $25.0 billion to $25.8 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected the company's sales to come in at $24.75 billion. “Moving into first quarter 2025, we expect our business to be impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand.” Huang said in a statement. The Price Action of TSM Stock In the last month, the shares have advanced 11.5%, while they are up 5.5% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: 400+ Journalists at “Washington Post” Sign Petition to Bezos

For decades, The Washington Post has been one of the nation’s premier newspapers, widely admired for its fearless journalism. During the McCarthy era in the 1950s, The Post held the reckless Senator from Wisconsin to account. It took the lead in exposing Watergate. A job at The Washington Post was a prize for any journalist. Jeff Bezos bought the paper in 2013. It was widely assumed that he had “saved” the paper from its financial woes because of his wealth and that he would not interfere with its editorial independence. But recently, Bezos’ stance changed. He hired Will Lewis, an editor from the despicable Murdoch empire, to turn the paper around financially. The paper has experienced layoffs and censorship. When Bezos’ spiked the editorial board’s endorsement of Kamala Harris last fall, more than 300,000 subscribers canceled. When an editorial cartoon lampooning billionaires (including Bezos) courting Trump was killed, the cartoonist quit. The morale of the staff hit rock-bottom. David Folkenflik of NPR reported on the rebellion among the journalists: One debacle after another has engulfed The Washington Post since veteran newspaper executive Will Lewis became CEO and publisher a year ago this month, with the charge from owner Jeff Bezos to make the storied newspaper financially sustainable. The appointment of a new executive editor was botched. A killed presidential endorsement led hundreds of thousands of subscribers to cancel. Top reporters and editors left. Scandals involving Lewis’ actions as a news executive years ago in the U.K. reemerged. A clear vision to secure the Post’s financial future remains elusive. Frustration boiled over on Tuesday night. More than 400 Post journalists, including some editors, signed a petition asking Bezos to intervene. “We are deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave,” it reads, in part. The petition never cites Lewis by name, but it reads as a sharp indictment of his leadership. Through a spokesperson, Lewis and the Post declined comment for this story. A representative of Bezos did not return a request for comment. For this story, NPR interviewed 10 Washington Post staffers inside the newsroom and on the business side of the paper, including some who did not sign the petition. They agreed to speak to NPR under condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions inside the paper. They say the backlash against Lewis encompasses Bezos to some degree, as he has publicly warmed up to President-elect Donald Trump. (The Post declined comment.) Bezos’ decision to kill a planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the November election led more than 300,000 subscribers to cancel, wiping out much more modest gains The Post had achieved under Lewis. (A spokesperson says The Post has convinced about 20% of those cancelling over the endorsement to remain subscribers.) The decision also led to some resignations. Recent days at the Post have witnessed the continuation of a months-long parade of departures of highly regarded newsroom veterans — most recently, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Rosalind Helderman, investigative reporter Josh Dawsey and columnist Jennifer Rubin. Pulitzer-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes quit after her sketch showing Bezos kneeling before Trump with a bag of money was rejected. The tech titan’s business interests, including Amazon Web Services and the space company Blue Origin, receive billions of dollars from federal contracts. He’s given $1 million toward Trump’s inauguration costs and traveled to Mar-a-Lago with his fiancée to meet with the president-elect. Amazon Studios agreed to pay Melania Trump millions of dollars for a documentary project about her, according to Puck News. Come Monday, Bezos is expected to join Trump advisor Elon Musk and Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg on the inauguration platform itself. The petition asked for a meeting with Bezos. Open the link to continue reading this important article. I think there should be a mass resignation from WaPo at this point. Band together and create a competing startup. I think fundraising and subscriptions would be very popular. I would sign up. LikeLike Daniel, It’s harder and more costly than you think to start a new newspaper. All of the 400+ who signed the petition have mortgages to pay, household expenses, etc. At this point, some other billionaire would have to buy the paper from Bezos. Someone who understands the idea of editorial independence and freedom of the press. LikeLiked by 1 person His ex-wife perhaps. LikeLike It sounds like neither Lewis nor Bezos, like Trump, know the difference between what Fox/Murdoch does and what the Washington Post has been about for a long time. In my view, if true, then these are morally defunct people, to say the least. If anyone hasn’t seen the movie “The Post,” with Tom Hanks and Merle Streep, it chronicles the crucial run up to the Nixon resignation inspired by that same WAPO and focuses on how difficult it was to stay on their principled track, . . . but they did. But for Lewis and Bezos, not to mention Murdoch, it’s probably “huh”? CBK LikeLike Friendly correction: Bezos bought WaPo in 2013, not 2023. LikeLike Thank you, Jack. I thought I typed 2013. But I didn’t. I do all my blogging on a cell phone and it’s easy to hit the wrong key because they are tiny.

Title: Microsoft Is Riding The Wave To Long-Term Growth Through AI And Cloud

By Nabeel Bukhari Summary Microsoft Corporation (MSFT, Financial) is a brand familiar to many, with its system integration being a part of life for millions of people globally. However, in an unusual irony, the stock has not risen to the extent expected, given the phenomenal growth of the technology industry in recent years. Nevertheless, Microsoft is still a giant and one of the biggest winners in the generative AI race. Its partnership with OpenAI is not only helpful to Azure's revenue growth but also bestows the company with a powerful role in the field of AI driven innovation. While Microsoft is not screaming value at present, its ability to generate robust double-digit growth with unmatched cash flow generation is almost impossible to ignore. While I've been pulling back on some of my biggest growth winners, Microsoft remains a standout stock with great long-term potential and with the ability to provide great returns. Microsoft's Q1 2025 earnings report shows the company is fully charged, with healthy growth rates coupled with progressive investments. Microsoft Revenue and Net Income Chart Total revenues of the company were up 16% year-over-year (YOY) to $65.6 billion, accelerating from the preceding quarter's growth rate of 15.2% and the 12.8% rate in the same period last year. Earnings per share were not far behind, rising at a 10% rate to $3.30 in part due to smart investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and the dilution from Activision Blizzard. Both factors, though modestly impacting the near-term profits, are in fact strategic actions taken for the purpose of securing the company's long-term control. Let's break down the Microsoft's key segments to better understand what drives this growth and where might the company be going next. The essence of Microsoft is in its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which is still the biggest source of both revenues and profits for the company at the time being. This segment generated a revenue of $28.3 billion which was up 12% and was ahead of the company's guidance of 10% primarily driven by strong uptake of enterprise products such as Microsoft 365 Copilot that incorporate AI. Management guidance of up to 11% growth next quarter supports the view that businesses will sustain efficiency through advanced AI capabilities. Yet, all the focus is on Azure, the crown jewel in the Intelligent Cloud segment (up 20% and generated a revenue of $24.1 billion) for Microsoft. Azure itself is up a monstrous 33%. Such acceleration proves the company's strength and its close connection with OpenAI which not only improves Azure but also brings in new clients eager for the best AI solutions. While management has forecasted up to a mind-boggling 32% growth next quarter, this is expected to increase in the second half of the year as more AI capacities come online. Azure's growth path may outpace the Productivity segment to become the new cash cow for Microsoft. Last but not least, the More Personal Computing segment's revenue of $13.2 billion, up 17%, is still more cyclical than the rest of the segments. Management anticipates that revenues in this segment will be slightly lower compared to the prior year due to lapping tougher comparables. However, the inclusion of Activision Blizzard as part of this segment points to long-run growth. The acquisition had a dilutive impact of $440 million on operating income this quarter, but synergies and cost discipline should help flip it into a growth driver. Furthermore, Microsoft is a fortress, with $116.2 billion in cash at the end of the quarter against $45 billion in debt. Microsoft Cash and Debt Chart As we look at the graph above, it's evident that the buffer has shrunk significantly compared to previous years. Well, that's due to increased capital expenditures to heavy investments. In 2023, the ratio dropped below 1.5 but the good news is that it has since recovered, back up to 1.28. This dip doesn't take away from the fact that Microsoft is in a great financial position and is well set up for a steady growth trajectory as its AI-driven investments mature. As of recent prices, MSFT found itself trading at around 33x earnings. Consensus estimates depict the stock to clock higher double-digit growth rates in the years to come. I consider these estimates reasonable based on the stellar momentum of Azure. The stock may not even appear as an obvious bargain at around 12x sales, as this multiple ranks highly compared to other software companies. However, I would like to stress that some premium is deserved given that MSFT is already earning such high profit margins, and, therefore, its high earnings yield would contribute to the continuous return prospects. In the longer term, I still expect net margins under GAAP to reach towards 45%-50% as operating leverage starts to kick in, up from 37.7% in the latest quarter. This actually put the current valuation at 25x long-term earnings, which could be considered reasonable with the strong balance sheet and long-term secular growth. Between the consensus estimate of double-digit revenue growth and the roughly 3% earnings yield, I think this stock can deliver between 15% to 17% annual compounded returns for the next five years or more. To get a return less than that projected by the above formula, either the company has to underperform the consensus growth estimates or the stock's valuation would need to compress. Even if we assume that the stock is trading at 21x long-term earnings in five years, the stock will return between 12% to 14% per year and will therefore outperform the average 8% return of the market. MSFT does trade at a slight premium to its 5-year average but is still not as greatly overvalued as one might think given the current tech euphoria and the company's position in it. Over the last five years, Microsoft's stock skyrocketed 160.58% as showed in the graph below, which demonstrates that the company has good opportunities in fast growth sectors like cloud computing, AI and enterprise software. But this performance also speaks about a market that is willing to pay a premium for steady and consistent growth. Microsoft Price Chart Currently, the stock's valuation multiples which I discussed previously are both considerably higher than Microsoft's historical ratios and its sector ‘s median. For the past year, Microsoft posted a 12.40% return, but this does not compare to the kind of growth witnessed previously due to market fluctuations. The stock rose to $450 in mid-2024 but has since corrected to trade in the $410-$425 range. This correction may have come from valuation concerns and other market factors rather than company-specific issues. However, it is important to note that the $400 level is the critical support zone as investors consider any price dip close to this range to be a good buying opportunity. Nonetheless, the current trading price of the stock reflects that the investors lack the enthusiasm to drive the valuations even higher. The $468.35 as a 52-week high is a significant resistance point while $450 has acted as the ceiling over the past year. Penetrating this barrier would require Microsoft to post stellar earnings or for the market sentiment to change. On the other hand, missing the high expectations may lead the stock to retest the $400 support level. In the short term, Microsoft shares are unlikely to move much beyond the $400-$450 range as the investors assess its valuation relative to growth potential. The longer-term stable scenario of maintaining double-digit top-line growth rates, along with GAAP net margin growth towards 45%, can justify further price increases. Investors should be careful of market risk and ensure that the stock's valuation is correct with regard to their investment horizon and risk tolerance. Microsoft fundamentals are good, however, short-term gains are expected to be dependent on its ability to beat high forecasts. The prospects appear favorable for Microsoft, however, there are some risks that may affect the thesis I've described above. First, lower-than-expected AI adoption is a big concern. The growth story heavily draws on Azure performance, depending on AI-powered tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot. However, delays in the adoption of these tools or issues related to the implementation of the same can slow down the overall AI and Cloud service revenues as anticipated. This might also slow down the total growth of the company. Another significant risk is the competitiveness threat that Microsoft experiences most in the cloud as well as the AI segments. Azure has been a good performer but in front of Microsoft are giant competitors like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud both of whom are actively using similar technologies. If these competitors advance further or if Azure's expansion is thrown off by more competition, then the rate of revenue expansion, which is core to the thesis could be impacted. Last but not least, regulatory challenges can not be ignored. Microsoft is under increasing pressure from regulators, notably due to the Activision Blizzard acquisition. If regulatory bodies enter or place restrictions on the company, there might be unhealthy hindrances or complicities in the company's expansion strategies. New regulations for Big Tech may also become a problem, which, together with existing problems, can cause additional risks to the company's future. These risks are noteworthy, considering they can influence both growth and valuation assumptions. All in all, Microsoft remains a great stock for the long-term investment. This is being achieved under the stewardship of Azure, which is driving impressive growth and with the company now placing more emphasis on AI, gives the impression that it is poised to benefit from some of the most promising trends in technology. Sure the stock is a little bit on the expensive side, but when you look at the cash flow, healthy margins and growth possibility that is being offered, the premium that is commanded for the stock seems well deserved. Of course, there are a few risks, but Microsoft has proved its abilities to overcome obstacles and to remain ahead of innovations. So as long as it keeps delivering in the AI and cloud sectors as it has done before, I believe the stock will keep on giving good returns. I would recommend Microsoft to anyone seeking solid, market-beating growth in tech, as the company possesses healthy financials and leads in high-growth areas. It's a stock you can hold onto and expect it to pay off in many years to come. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Meta's 'non-regrettable attrition' and the other corporate lingo used to downplay job cuts

Time Published: 2025-01-16T15:32:52Z

Allow for a quick riff on RIFs. Many companies go out of their way to avoid calling job cuts what they are. Whether it's a "reduction in force," "rightsizing," or "streamlining," the fancy language doesn't soften the blow for workers — or hide the reality of lost jobs. One recent example: Meta said this week it would push out an additional 5% of what Mark Zuckerberg called "low-performers." Clear enough. Yet in a subsequent memo from Hillary Champion, Meta's director of people development growth programs, the focus became "non-regrettable attrition." At Amazon, a phrase often used for such cuts is "unregretted attrition." It's the type of language that can draw snark online. Following Meta's announcement, one person wrote on X: "'Non-regrettable attrition' lmao.'" A Meta spokesperson declined to comment beyond saying the company plans to fill the vacated positions in 2025. Steve McClatchy, who consults on leadership and is the author of the book "Leading Relationships," told BI that public companies often use euphemistic language around job cuts to try to avoid spooking investors and raising concerns that the business is in trouble. But, he said, that effort often falls flat when they use terms like nonregrettable attrition. "How sad is that language? It's trying to say to the ownership group, we're headed in the right direction, not the wrong one," McClatchy said. There are numerous other ways to frame offboarding, err, cutbacks, err, workforce adjustments, and the need to do so. For example, the news site TechCrunch told BI on Tuesday it's reducing staff because of "evolving needs." It's possible that for many employers, workforce optimization, organizational realignment, and — shout out to ChatGPT for this one — internal mobility challenges just sound better than job cuts. Yet, workplace experts told BI, the fallout is the same. "We're seeing a lot of companies now do everything not to use the actual word layoff, even though that's exactly what they're doing," Peter Rahbar, an employment attorney who founded the boutique law firm the Rahbar Group, told BI. A spokesperson for the food giant Cargill previously told BI that job cuts were designed to "realign our talent and resources to align with our strategy." Last year, Bumble said it would cut about 30% of its workforce "to better align its operating model with future strategic priorities." Cutting jobs is often bad for morale and can hurt productivity when workers become consumed with worrying they're next. That can be true even with a case like that of Meta, which said it planned to "backfill" roles in 2025. Translation: hire better people — though not you. Yet, McClatchy said, to imply that a worker who gets pushed out for poor performance is solely at fault misses the responsibility that employers have to make good hires and that managers have to help those under their tutelage perform their best. "It's 100% an attack on the employee that has to go then find a job. And what a shame that is," he said. Sandra Sucher, a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School who has studied layoffs, told BI that most terms for layoffs are designed to make an otherwise negative act appear more positive. She said companies often use the term regrettable attrition for good workers they're sorry to see leave. So a term like nonregrettable attrition is a way of "sugarcoating" the fact that an employer is letting people go. Connecting it to attrition is meant, Sucher said, to imply that employers have a handle on the outflow. Yet, she said, attrition isn't always something companies can control. "The point of attrition is that you're not managing it. It's something that, by and large, happens to you," she said. Rahbar, the attorney, said employers' choice of wording when it comes to culling workers isn't about protecting themselves legally. Instead, he said, it's mostly a public-relations dance and, ultimately, one that does little good. "If you're an employee who is impacted by this, the language they're using to describe it is irrelevant. It's not going to soften the blow," Rahbar said. Ravin Jesuthasan, a coauthor of the book "The Skills-Powered Organization" and the global leader for transformation services at the consulting firm Mercer, told BI that employers have been cutting jobs for more than a century when business falters. "I don't know why there was a need to introduce new language," he said. In some cases, the words aren't new; they're just redeployed, reassigned, or transitioned to a new role. In Champion's memo at Meta, she wrote that the company was "aiming to exit" an additional 5% of its workers who'd been around long enough to get a performance rating. "'Exit' as in GTFO!" one X user posted. Not all euphemisms might be as likely to whip up worker cynicism, of course. The practice of scoring workers based on various metrics and getting rid of the worst performers sometimes goes by the human-resources shorthand "rank and yank." Corporatespeak can also be a handy way to add levity in uncertain times. One social media user wrote on X about what might happen when artificial intelligence shows up to make cutbacks, oblique language in tow. "Humans will become 'Non-Regrettable Attrition' for AI," the person wrote. Do you have something to share about job cuts or something else at work? Business Insider would like to hear from you.

Title: TSMC stock rises more than 5% after record net profit driven by AI chip demand
URL: https://qz.com/tsmc-taiwan-ai-chip-demand-stock-q4-quarter-earnings-1851740939
Time Published: 2025-01-16T15:30:00Z
Full Content:
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM+3.79%) U.S.-listed shares rose by more than 6% at the market open on Thursday morning. The chipmaker’s stock was up by more than 5% during pre-market trading after its fourth-quarter earnings results beat expectations. Later in the morning, TSMC’s shares were up by around 5.6%. The company reported net revenue of NT$868.46 billion, or $26.36 billion, and record net income of NT$374.68 billion, or about $11.3 billion for the quarter ended December 31. TSMC said its fourth quarter revenue increased 38.8% year over year, while net income rose 57% from the previous year to a record high. “Our business in the fourth quarter was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” Wendell Huang, chief financial officer of TSMC, said in a statement. “Moving into first quarter 2025, we expect our business to be impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand.” Shipments of advanced 3-nanometer chips made up 26% of total wafer revenue, TSMC said, while advanced 5-nanometer chips accounted for 34%, and 7-nanometer chips were 14% of the total. On a post-earnings call with analysts, TSMC chief executive C.C. Wei said the company “observed robust AI-related demand from our customers throughout 2024.” Revenue from TSMC’s AI accelerators “accounted for close to mid-teens percent of our total revenue in 2024,” Wei said. The Taiwanese chipmaker set revenue guidance for the first quarter of 2025 at between $25 billion and $25.8 billion — higher than a consensus by analysts of $24.4 billion, according to a Jefferies (JEF+2.25%) note. Wei said TSMC’s first fab in Arizona entered high-volume production in the fourth quarter using the 4-nanometer process, and reached a yield comparable to its facilities in Taiwan. The chipmaker expects “a smooth ramp-up process,” Wei said, and is confident in having “the same level of manufacturing quality and reliability from our fab in Arizona as for our fab in Taiwan.” TSMC is also on track with its second and third Arizona fabs, Wei said. Earlier this week, the Biden administration introduced new rules encouraging chip producers such as TSMC to improve customer scrutiny and due diligence in an effort to prevent advanced chips from getting to Chinese customers.

Title: The Best Foods to Buy in Bulk, According to a Meal Planning Pro

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Bulk groceries cost significantly less. Here are six staples you can stockpile for the next several months. We asked an expert about the best foods to buy in bulk. The price of groceries still remains a hot topic. According to a recent CNET survey, it's still the No. 1 source of sticker shock for Americans, myself included. We've covered numerous ways to save a little money in your grocery budget: food saving apps such as Flashfood; the difference in cost between name brand and store brand groceries; and whether shopping at Trader Joe's results in meaningful savings over other grocery chains. And, of course, there's buying in bulk. After doing some math, I found that the average person could save $1,000 a year by shopping at Costco for bulk foods. Buying in bulk can be more complicated, however, due to storage considerations, and the difference in shelf life between various items. According to Mary Ann Kelley, the meal planning expert behind AddSaltandServe, "Shoppers can ask themselves three questions: Will my savings be significant compared to the lowest price at all stores? Will I use the items before they expire or lose quality? A great price does not save money if the item will not be used. And finally, do I have room to store items I buy in bulk?" Read more: Here's what an expert told me about food expiration dates Accepting that bulk shopping is generally a financially savvy move, and given the considerations posed above, I asked a few shopping and meal prepping experts what the best foods are to buy in bulk. Here they are: Beans are packed with protein and they're the perfect candidates to buy in bulk. "Canned beans are a pantry staple and a smart bulk purchase, thanks to their long shelf life and affordability at warehouse stores," says Kristen Markel, the bulk shopping expert behind Warehouse Wanderer. Beans also are incredibly versatile for food prep, as they can fit into just about any meal, including dessert. (Black bean brownies are worth your time.) Plus they have real staying power. "Properly stored in a cool, dark place, canned beans can last up to five years," says Markel. An eight-pack of canned beans at Costco retails for about $7.99, bringing the cost per can to under a dollar, and the cost per serving to about 30 cents. If you've got the time and wherewithal for dried beans, the savings are even bigger. A 10-pound bag of black beans costs around $18, for a cost per serving of less than 25 cents. If freezer space allows, fish is far more affordable when you buy in bulk. Meat and seafood in the freezer section are often frozen right after harvesting, so they can still be very high in quality. You can also process proteins bought fresh and freeze them yourself, and either way certain types of meat and seafood can stay in your freezer for up to a year. (This FoodKeeper app from the US Department of Health and Human Services is a handy guide to how long you can store various foods.) "Shoppers can often find bulk-packaged fresh and frozen meat at a better price, or they may stock up on bulk amounts of normal packages of meat when they are on sale," says Kelley. It's possible to have a bulk shopping mindset even if you don't have access to a traditional bulk store. "Meat bought in bulk at a good price can be frozen as is, but shoppers can also save space -- and make dinner prep less stressful -- by cooking meats ahead that will be used later in cooked form in recipes. For instance, shoppers can cook bulk packages of ground beef or chicken when they bring them home, and then they can use the cooked meat for recipes like tacos, chili, and chicken soup." Butter is more shelf-stable than most people think, making it a good candidate for buying in bulk. We typically think primarily of the pantry or freezer when it comes to buying in bulk, but "don't overlook dairy, especially butter," says Markel. "Butter freezes beautifully and can last up to a year in the freezer." Costco's Kirkland Signature butter is considered one of its most economical offerings among fans, around $18 (in my region) for 4 pounds, which doesn't come with an overwhelming space requirement in the freezer. At my nearest grocery store, the same amount of butter costs twice that much. Boxed pasta lasts for up to two years. Boxed pasta may require some storage space, but if you're able to bulk up on it, it has the longevity to make it worthwhile. "Dry pasta is another bulk-buy winner, with an unopened shelf life of up to two years," says Markel. "For even longer storage, consider vacuum-sealing pasta to maintain freshness well beyond its typical expiration." (Here are the best vacuum sealers we've tested.) Eight pounds of Barilla penne cost $12.99 at Costco, which results in a savings of over a dollar per pound compared with buying individual boxes at my local supermarket. Italian American families, or carb lovers, take note. Not all spices are good to buy in bulk, but whole peppercorns keep their pep for a while. Items with the highest prices per ounce can be prime candidates for bulk shopping, on a case-by-case basis depending on longevity. "Specialty items that cost significantly less on sale can be worth buying in bulk, but only if they will be used," says Kelley. "A good example of this is expensive spices that might be used frequently, like quality black peppercorns," she says. Other specialty items that can be pricey but can be stockpiled when they're on sale include saffron, tinned fish and even caviar -- which can actually be frozen when unopened and kept for up to a year. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, buy paper towels and other household products in bulk. So long as you're bulk shopping, here's a bonus nonfood item. "Paper products are among the items that are less expensive to buy in bulk packaging, especially toilet paper and paper towels," says Kelley." "Since paper products do not need to be stored in a climate controlled area, utility spaces, attics, and other unfinished spaces are fine for storage, making it easier to make room for them." If you have a paper towel dependency, as I do, consider a 12-pack of Kirkland paper towels for $22.99, versus single rolls that can be as much as $3 and up.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks wavered on Thursday, with the major indexes struggling to build on the previous day's surge amid another round of big bank earnings. Investors also watched as the Senate hearing kicked off for President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) hovered near the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.1%. Markets are coming off a major one-day rally on the heels of a surprise easing in consumer inflation that prompted questions about whether the pricing out of interest-rate cuts this year had gone too far. Stocks ripped higher on Wednesday on the back of the data and stellar earnings from major US lenders. Traders have now ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve lowers rates before July, reversing the pile-out that was sparked by the stronger-than-expected December jobs report. Retail sales for December grew by 0.4%, versus expectations of 0.6%. The monthly gain slowed from November’s 0.7% increase. Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected to 217,000, versus the prior week's upwardly revised 203,000. Meanwhile, Bank of America (BAC) results showed fourth quarter profit more than doubled as the bank benefitted from a Wall Street dealmaking revival that has also boosted earnings at its rivals. Its shares were up slightly in early trading. Morgan Stanley's (MS) stock also rose after it posted a surge in quarterly profit before the bell. Elsewhere in earnings, UnitedHealth's (UNH) fourth quarter revenue fell short of estimates, dented by weakness in its health insurance unit. The stock slid in early trading. Also taking focus Thursday was the Senate Finance Committee hearing on Bessent's confirmation. Topics investors were watching to surface during the gathering include tariff policies and debt concerns amid Republican initiatives for 2025 tax and spending plans. Scott Bessent, the nominee for Treasury Secretary highlighted an opportunity for a new 'Golden Age' for the US during opening remarks at his confirmation hearing. "Today, I believe that President Trump has a generational opportunity to unleash a new economic Golden Age that will create more jobs, wealth, and prosperity for all Americans," Bessent told lawmakers on Thursday morning. The nominee highlighted his life's work in the private sector has given him a understanding of the economy and markets. "Having never served in government, I intend if confirmed, to be in close contact with each of you and your offices, and seek your council," said Bessent. He also highlighted the need for the government to ensure the US Dollar remains the world's reserve currency. Lawmakers were making opening remarks on Thursday morning at the confirmation hearing for President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Treasury secretary Scott Bessent. The hearing is likely to last about two and a half hours. Likely topics Bessent will face questions on include policies surrounding tariffs, and Republican initiatives for 2025 tax initiatives and spending plans. President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of the US Department of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, will face questions from lawmakers on Capitol Hill today starting at 10:30 a.m ET. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports on two issues to watch for during the hearing which have come into focus this week. One is around a swirl of seemingly competing tariff plans before President-elect Donald Trump, some of which Bessent himself is reportedly pushing. A second is whether Republicans will be able to ignore debt concerns and go big with their 2025 tax and spending plans. Read more here. Builders are starting the year with more optimism than in the end of 2024, despite elevated mortgage rates. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose to 47 in January, up one point from December and higher than economists’ estimates of 45, per Bloomberg data. Still, a reading under 50 indicates more builders view conditions as poor rather than good. The dilemma of high housing costs persists, with mortgage rates hovering closer to 7% over the past four consecutive weeks, according to Freddie Mac. Markets expect the Fed will likely leave rates unchanged this month, especially after fresh inflation data released Wednesday showed some signs of easing. The Fed doesn’t set mortgage rates but its actions influence the direction of yields, which in turn affect borrowing costs. The NAHB survey showed builders continue to offer concessions in January. The survey found that 60% of builders used some sort of sales incentive to close the deal, while 30% of builders cut home prices to bolster sales in January. The average price reduction was 5%, matching December’s price cut. US stocks were mixed on Thursday following the S&P 500's (^GSPC) best daily performance since November and strong quarterly bank earnings. The broad based index rose more than 0.1% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased about 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered near the flatline. Investors were watching for a continuation of Thursday's performance when stocks ripped higher on the heels of better than expected inflation data and strong quarterly bank earnings. Traders have been assessing how many rate cuts the Federal Reserve will implement this year following a better than expected jobs report last Friday but a cooling inflation print on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent note they "now forecast two 25bp cuts this year in June and December (vs. three cuts previously in March, June, and September) followed by another cut in June 2026." Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports: Retail sales grew at a slower pace than Wall Street had expected in December as investors keep a close eye on the pace of economic growth amid questions over how quickly the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. Retail sales rose 0.4% in December. Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in November were revised up to 0.8% from a prior reading that showed a 0.7% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. Read more here. Good chart by the Vanda Research team looking at Mag 7 flows from the retail trading community. You can see activity having slowed down in January with names like Nvidia under pressure. Dare I say it's refreshing to see traders nibble at the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500!

Hunt (JBHT), Morgan Stanley (MS), PNC (PNC), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), U.S. Bancorp USB (USB) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Bank of America profit soars on Wall Street revival TSMC's upbeat outlook fuels hopes for 2025 AI spending Morgan Stanley profit jumps on rise in dealmaking, stock sale BP to eliminate 5% of workforce to cut costs UnitedHealth Q4 revenue falls short as insurance unit struggles Investors seek $5 billion for basketball league to rival NBA Target raises its holiday sales forecast How bond vigilantes could check Trump's power Target (TGT) dropped its holiday sales results this morning, and the stock is up in the pre-market. Not sure why Target didn't blow me away! Sales barely grew and the company reiterated its EPS outlook — an outlook that at the top end is 20 cents below current sell-side consensus. Bottom line: this is yet another quarter from Target that sheds light on its continued market share loss to Walmart (WMT). Here's what Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told me when accepting our 2024 Company of the Year award. PS: I like Walmart's new blue logo color that ties back to founder Sam Walton's iconic trucker hat.

Title: How blowout bank earnings and a promising inflation report gave the market a much-needed boost
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-stocks-recover-after-bank-earnings-inflation-data-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-16T14:14:52Z

Hello there! A product going viral can be a double-edged sword for retailers. Just ask Walmart. The big-box store's e-commerce marketplace got a boost from an imitation Hermès' Birkin bag making the rounds, but dupes also cause headaches for brand relationships. In today's big story, US banks' impressive earnings and a hopeful inflation report have stocks back on the rise. What's on deck Markets: Anthony Scaramucci offers some economic predictions for Trump's second term. Tech: The VC world is starting to heal as Insight Partners raises a massive new fund. Business: Billionaires are booked and busy next week thanks to a scheduling conflict between the inauguration and Davos. But first, we're so back. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's alive! After a slow start to the year, the stock market finally showed signs of life thanks to blowout bank earnings and better-than-expected inflation data. The S&P 500 finished Wednesday up 1.83%, while the Dow (1.65%) and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite (2.45%) posted strong days. Let's start with Wall Street. Big US banks represent the unofficial kickoff to earnings season, and they didn't disappoint. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo all beat analysts expectations. JPMorgan saw a 50% year-over-year increase in profits for the fourth quarter while Goldman's profits jumped an incredible 105%. The banking boom was largely driven by classic Wall Street businesses like corporate dealmaking, capital raising, and trading. December's inflation report also put extra wind in the market's sails. At first glance — inflation rose for the third straight month — the reading might not seem great. But a closer look showed the consumer price index's year-over-year increase matched consensus expectations, which is good. What's even better, though, is core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was slightly below expectations. It also came in lower than November's number. Before you get ahead of yourself, don't expect a slew of rate cuts. Instead, the data calmed investors' nerves by slowing the troubling rise of the 10-year Treasury yield, which dropped 0.14%. "Core Inflation isn't accelerating and that's the story. The market may have had its hair on fire about inflation running away again, but the data do not support that conclusion," said Jamie Cox, Managing Partner for Harris Financial Group. So what's next for Wall Street? In the short term, bankers might finally enjoy some healthy bonuses after a few slim years. Workers are starting to find out about their year-end comp. Bigger picture, it's more momentum for the industry's job market. After a lull in activity, firms are bolstering their ranks across the board for what appears to be an active 2025. The private markets are one area that'll remain in the spotlight. The sector, which includes less-liquid investments like private equity and private credit that come with higher fees, is of particular interest to BlackRock. The $11.6 trillion asset manager sees it as the key to its next stage of evolution, according to CEO Larry Fink. One evolution Fink didn't discuss was who will take over when he's gone. That's despite the recent departure of executive Mark Wiedman, which reignited questions about what life after Larry will look like at BlackRock. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was a little bit more forthcoming with his own retirement plans … sort of. When asked by an analyst who his successor was, Dimon said there are a number of great candidates, but a decision hasn't been made. And even if the bank did have someone in mind, there's no guarantee things won't change, Dimon added. 1. One of Trump's opps is feeling good about the economy. Despite being a longtime Trump critic, Anthony Scaramucci is pretty optimistic about the economy under the incoming 47th president. He sees Trump's pro-growth policies and potential crypto legislation as an economic boon — but he's still concerned about some of Trump's other promises. 2. Hindenburg Research is tapping out. Nate Anderson, founder of the short-selling firm, said he's disbanding it, once they've completed all outstanding projects. Hindenburg gained fame for its forensic financial research, often focusing on what it argued to be fraudulent or misleading corporate behavior. Anderson said he plans to share the firm's investigation tactics publicly. 3. Dividend stocks are so back. Large-cap stocks have dominated the market, but a change could be coming, according to Morningstar. As their valuations continue to climb, dividend stocks might become more palatable. Morningstar highlighted dividend stocks in four specific sectors savvy investors should pay attention to. 1. Mark Zuckerberg lost $60 billion in five years — and he's going to keep spending. Despite persistent predictions that the VR and AR headset market will boom, consumers just aren't interested. Meta lost big on the tech in the last few years, but that hasn't deterred Zuck, who keeps telling investors they should expect more losses in the future. 2. Exclusive: Insight Partners raises $12.5 billion for its newest set of funds. It's the largest sum raised by a venture capital firm in over two years, according to PitchBook data. Insight's $12.5 billion may be less than its initial funding goal, but it's still an impressive get as the industry looks to mount a comeback. 3. "TikTok refugees" flock to Chinese app RedNote. While some Americans are coping with a possible TikTok ban through memes, competitors like Texas-based app Clapper are seizing the moment. Other Americans are heading to the Chinese app Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote. It might be worth learning how to use it — but some members of Congress are already taking aim. 1. WFH + Fridays = OOO. For some remote workers, the W in WFH Friday is a bit of a stretch. They're turning every weekend into a three-day weekend, and they don't feel particularly bad about it, either. 2. Home Depot cofounders were investigated by the FBI in the '70s and '80s, new public records show. The FBI was investigating Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank over claims they used a slush fund in an attempt to bribe California Handy Dan employees to decertify their union, newly obtained records show. The investigation ended in 1983 when a prosecutor determined the case was too old and evidence was "insufficient." 3. Double-booked billionaires. January 20 is not only Trump's inauguration but also the first day of the World Economic Forum's high-profile conference in Davos, Switzerland. Conflicted guests will have to choose between missing potential face time with the new president or a day of brushing shoulders with the global elite. Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi won't be missing out on Trump's big day. Boeing's dismal 2024 deliveries show just how much of a challenge CEO Kelly Ortberg faces. UnitedHealth Group, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley report earnings.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Quantum computing stocks pushed on with their run in premarket trading Thursday after gaining steam Wednesday. The good news comes as industry leaders highlight quantum computing advancements and potential growth prospects in the sector. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with RGTI. Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT, Financial) shares jumped 15.5%, while Rigetti Computing Inc. (RGTI, Financial) advanced 3.4%, D-Wave Quantum Inc. (QBTS, Financial) gaining 9.6% and IonQ Inc. (IONQ, Financial) rising 1.9%. It reflects a growing interest by investors, spurred by the growing corporate commitment to quantum technologies. However, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT, Financial) has been the sector's biggest cheerleader. In the case of Mitra Azizirad, COO of Microsoft's strategic missions and technology division: from 2020, talk will be of businesses moving to become the familiar 'quantum-ready' by 2025. This push is backed up by Nvidia Corp. (NVDA, Financial), which announced that it will host a Quantum Day' at its upcoming GTC conference and is committing to integrate quantum computing within classical systems. Despite some industry sceptics like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who estimates practical quantum computing is still a couple of decades away, companies are proactively creating the work environments that will make it happen. Microsoft has programs for businesses to help tackle this technological evolution, and Nvidia is now recruiting for roles in quantum research. Since Google broke onto the quantum scene with its Willow quantum chip, the quantum sector has also come under the microscope. Companies in this developing quantum era are positioning themselves for long-term growth and are being watched closely by investors and analysts alike. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Title: Forbes Daily: Biden Takes Aim At Big Tech In Final Days As President

Plus: The use of AI kissing apps and their promotion on social media including Meta and TikTok have some experts concerned about the lack of consent involved and the continued rise of deepfakes. Good morning, Corporate training videos can be dull. But one British startup is betting it can use AI to change that. Synthesia’s AI avatars are already used by companies like Xerox, Spirit Airlines and chemicals giant DuPont to convert training text into videos in over 20 languages—with just one click. Synthesia just raised $180 million, valuing it at $2.1 billion, to make its avatars more lifelike and invest in tools for creating and hosting videos. Eventually, the company could compete with giants like OpenAI’s Sora or AI video startup Runway. But Synthesia’s lucrative niche making human proxies means its customers are more likely to be HR teams rather than Hollywood directors. President Joe Biden speaks about the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release deal as Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken look on. Israel and Gaza-based militant group Hamas agreed to a ceasefire deal Wednesday after more than 15 months of fighting and just days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. President Joe Biden said in a press conference that American hostages would be released as part of the first phase of the deal, but that all other details of the plan would be forthcoming. Officials believe 98 hostages remain in Gaza and that about 60 are still alive, per the Washington Post. If ByteDance were to sell TikTok to avoid an impending ban in the U.S. (which it has indicated it has no plans to do), how much would it be worth? Frank McCourt, the former Los Angeles Dodgers owner leading a group bidding for the social media giant, thinks TikTok’s U.S. business is worth $20 billion without its powerful “recommendation engine” which suggests new videos. But with the prized algorithm, one analyst thinks that a price of $300 billion “could be conservative.” MORE: Trump is considering ways to prevent TikTok’s potential ban, including a possible executive order, according to the Washington Post. Meanwhile, the social media company’s CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the president-elect’s inauguration next week, with the New York Times reporting that he was formally invited by the inaugural committee. Inflation is still not back to the pre-pandemic norm. Inflation reached its highest level since the summer in December, at 2.9% year-over-year, though it was in line with economists’ projections. The higher inflation reading was at least in part a reflection of price increases tied to the turn of the calendar year, according to two Goldman Sachs economists. But core CPI inflation, which excludes food and energy price changes, was 3.2%, better than consensus estimates. MORE: Markets responded strongly to the report, the first inflation reading of the year, as the S&P 500 ended up 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.65% and the Nasdaq surged 2.45%, their best days since November 6. Still, one strategist warned the market’s recent fickle nature should keep investors on their toes. Payments startup Bolt’s $450 million raise is on ice after investors sued to block the round, but one Bolt shareholder has managed to escape the turmoil. Delaware’s Court of the Chancery ruled in a December 16 hearing that Bolt investor Activant Capital could sell $37 million of its shares back to the startup, ending a legal dispute that began in July 2023. The Blue Origin New Glenn rocket lifts off Thursday in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin successfully launched its New Glenn heavy lift rocket into orbit early Thursday—though it failed to meet a secondary goal of recovering a reusable booster stage of the rocket, which was lost during reentry. Still, the launch helps Blue Origin notch a key milestone as it aims to compete with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Three-year-old startup Saronic, which aims to make a fleet of autonomous boats for the U.S. Navy, is in talks to raise $500 million, Forbes has learned. The fundraising round would value the nascent company at over $3 billion, the latest signal of booming venture capital interest in defense tech. In his farewell address Wednesday night, President Joe Biden warned Americans about what he called an oligarchy “of extreme wealth, power and influence” taking root in the U.S. The president also took aim at Big Tech, saying that he was “concerned about the potential rise of a tech-industrial complex,” while calling for more safeguards on powerful AI technologies. President-elect Donald Trump hosted 22 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors at a dinner at Mar-a-Lago last week. All these visitors, including dozens of other political powerbrokers, will likely boost Mar-a-Lago’s bottom line: Profits at the club have already more than doubled since the end of Trump’s first term. Drake sued Universal Music Group, which represents both himself and rapper Kendrick Lamar, accusing the major music company of defamation for releasing and promoting Lamar’s diss track “Not Like Us.” Drake’s lawsuit claims that UMG—but not Lamar—falsely promoted the ideas that Drake has committed acts of pedophilia and sex trafficking, which the rapper denies. The delays at the heart of the lawsuit date back to 2022. The Transportation Department sued Southwest Airlines over “chronically delayed flights,” its latest action after fining JetBlue Airways over the same issue earlier this month. The lawsuit alleges Southwest flights from Chicago to Oakland and from Baltimore to Cleveland reached their destinations late nearly 200 times in 2022, according to CNBC. Brightline West, a bullet train project from billionaire investor Wes Eden to connect Las Vegas with suburban Los Angeles, is raising $2.5 billion from private investors with a tax-exempt bond offering. The new funding push, along with a $3 billion federal grant and other funds, is intended to help cover the estimated $12.4 billion needed to complete the line. Brightline seeks to launch passenger service by late 2028. As wildfires rage in Southern California, many are asking what they can do to help. Tax-exempt charities accepting wildfire-specific donations include the American Red Cross, the California Fire Foundation, the Los Angeles Food Bank and Direct Relief. Even if you’re not planning to claim a tax deduction, some of the tax rules that apply to charitable donations—like checking to see that the organization you’re giving to has its paperwork in order—are good rules to follow. MORE: Those impacted by the fire may get some relief from the IRS and the tax code, for instance, by taking an early withdrawal from a workplace retirement savings account without the penalty. And individuals and businesses in a federally declared disaster area are entitled to claim casualty loss deductions. ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; IMAGE BY BORIS SV/GETTY IMAGES TOPLINE Meta and TikTok have run thousands of ads for apps that use AI to generate fake kissing videos of people, allowing users to upload photos of any two people and let AI convert them into a video of them kissing. The apps are being marketed as tools that would allow you to instantly “kiss anyone you want”—no consent required. Similar in concept to “AI nudifier” apps that produce nonconsensual deepfake pornography, these AI kissing apps create believable videos of people doing something they didn’t do. And the ease at which they do it is a concerning habitualization of deepfake imagery. While the ads are not sexually explicit like the deluge of AI-generated pornographic content that has engulfed social media platforms like Instagram, Reddit and YouTube, they can be equally dangerous, Haley McNamara, an executive at the National Center for Sexual Exploitation told Forbes. The companies behind these video generators appear to be based outside the U.S. in countries like the United Arab Emirates, Italy and China, according to their websites. The apps are available for free on Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store and already have millions of downloads. The spread of AI kissing apps, boosted by social media’s virality, illustrate a troubling mainstreaming of deepfakes in the age of generative AI. Use of these seemingly harmless apps could open the door to tools that could create more graphic imagery like deepfake porn and other types of image-based sexual abuse, McNamara said. “It’s just an absolute Pandora’s box,” she said. WHY IT MATTERS “The rise of an ‘AI kissing trend’ on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok represents the mainstreaming of deepfakes at a time when AI tools are being used to create nonconsensual pornographic deepfakes,” says Forbes reporter Rashi Shrivastava. “As is the case with AI image generators like Stable Diffusion, such systems can be misused to create videos of someone without their consent, and bully or harass them.” MORE Almost Half The Girls At This School Were Targets Of AI Porn. Their Ex-Classmates Have Now Been Indicted. Apple and Google have delisted apps developed by the Huione Group, a Cambodian company accused on Tuesday of running the biggest dark web market of all time: As much as $24 billion: The amount of sales that have gone through the Huione Guarantee platform, according to crypto crime tracker Elliptic $5 billion: The amount of sales on the next most lucrative illegal bazaar, Hydra ‘The largest illicit online marketplace to have ever operated’: Elliptic said of Huione’s Telegram-based platform Finally receiving a job offer after a lengthy search feels like a huge weight lifted, but the next step, salary negotiation, requires careful navigation. First, research industry-specific salary ranges, and consider other forms of compensation, like stock options, health benefits and bonus structures. Try to strike a balance between being assertive and diplomatic. If a company provides a lowball offer, counter with a well-researched figure that reflects your true worth. As a potential TikTok ban looms, some users are flocking to one of China’s most popular social media apps. Which app is it? A. WeChat B. Weibo C. RedNote D. Tencent QQ Check your answer.

Time Published: 2025-01-16T12:36:37Z

On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s TSM fourth-quarter results beat forecasts, fueled by demand for advanced processor node technologies for artificial intelligence applications. The contract chipmaker, which supplies chips for Nvidia Corp’s NVDA graphics processing unit (GPU) and Apple, Inc’s AAPL smartphones, guided first-quarter revenue above the consensus. Taiwan Semiconductor reported fourth-quarter revenue of $26.88 billion (NT$868.46 billion), up 38.8% year-over-year, topping the analyst consensus estimate of $26.28 billion. Also Read: OPEC’s Optimism Clashes With IEA’s Conservative 2025 Oil Growth Projections Net income and earnings per share were NT$374.68 billion and NT$14.45 per share ($2.24) versus analyst consensus of $2.23. In dollar terms, revenue growth was 37.0% year over year and 14.4% quarter over quarter. The top-line performance aligned with the company’s guidance of $26.1 billion—$26.9 billion. Taiwan Semiconductor said its business was supported by demand for its 3-nm and 5-nm technologies. However, it expects smartphone seasonality to impact the first quarter, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand. The company said 3-nm accounted for 26% of the total revenue, 5-nm accounted for 34%, and 7-nm technologies accounted for 14%. 7-nm and more advanced technologies comprised 74% of the total wafer revenue. Margin Profile: Taiwan Semiconductor’s AI technology moat helped it expand its fourth-quarter gross margins by 600 bps to 59%, as its 3-nm and 5-nm chips gain traction at the cost of Intel Corp INTC and Samsung Electronics SSNLF, which struggled to transition into advanced nodes. Taiwan Semiconductor’s operating margin expanded by 740 bps to 49%. Outlook: Taiwan Semiconductor is guided for first-quarter 2025 revenue of $25.0 billion-$25.8 billion versus the $24.97 billion consensus estimate. It expects a gross margin of 57%—59% and operating profit margins of 46.5%—48.5%. The company earmarked fiscal 2025 capex worth $38 billion-$42 billion (versus $29.8 billion a year ago) amid intensifying geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, with the former eying tougher artificial intelligence technology restrictions on the latter, citing national security concerns. Taiwan Semiconductor stock surged over 103% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to semiconductor manufacturing stocks through the VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH and the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX. Price Action: TSM stock traded higher by 4.86% at $216.85 premarket at the last check on Thursday. Also Read: Photo by wakamatsu.h via Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: ‘Deeply alarmed’: 400 Washington Post journalists demand Jeff Bezos' intervention – What went wrong?
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/washington-post-deeply-alarmed-400-journalists-demand-jeff-bezos-intervention-what-went-wrong-11737025618889.html
Time Published: 2025-01-16T11:44:23Z
Full Content:
Washington Post has reportedly seen a mass exodus of talent, following which at least 400 journalists have written to the Post's owner Jeff Bezos seeking an intervention, and expressing concern over the future of the esteemed newspaper. The plea from staff comes a week after the The Post laid off roughly 100 employees, amid financial struggles. The layoffs amounted to roughly 4% of the publication’s staff. According to a report by CNN, the list of 400 journalists include some well known correspondents like the publication’s chief correspondent Dan Balz. They have requested Jeff Bezos to visit the Washington, DC, newsroom and speak to the The Post's leaders. The letter, obtained by CNN, read “we are deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave, with more departures imminent.” The Washington Post journalists have said in their letter to Jeff Bezos ‘trust has been lost’ and has sought in-person meeting with billionaire owner over paper’s future. “This is about retaining our competitive edge, restoring trust that has been lost, and re-establishing a relationship with leadership based on open communication,” it continues. While the letter to Jeff Bezos doesn’t mention The Post publisher and CEO William Lewis by name, it strongly suggested the staff had lost faith in the newspaper’s leadership. According to CNN, over the past year, William Lewis has made disruptive changes to The Post and been accused of harboring hostility toward the newsroom. Lewis has also reportedly continued to face questions about his journalistic integrity relating to his past work as a senior executive at Rupert Murdoch’s British newspapers. Jeff Bezos, the billionaire Amazon founder, hired William Lewis little more than a year ago, charging him with turning around the money-losing publication. CNN notes, Jeff Bezos has been a mostly hands-off owner of The Post, and in some ways that has been a blessing, giving the newspaper’s journalists autonomy to write critically about Bezos, Amazon and related topics. The letter acknowledges that Jeff Bezos’s decision to block The Post editorial board’s planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris was “the owner’s prerogative.” The non-endorsement caused hundreds of thousands of Post subscribers to cancel as a form of protest. The Post lost 250,000 subscribers, or 10% of its subscription base, following its decision not to endorse. This reportedly was a massive contributor to the paper losing a whopping $100m in 2024, according to the Wall Street Journal. Digital visitors for the Washington Post website are also down, dropping from 114 million in November 2020 to 54 million in November 2024, according to Guardian report. Jeff Bezos did not immediately comment on the letter that he received. However, last month, in rare public comments about the Post, Bezos said at The New York Times DealBook Summit that the The Post “needs to be put back on a good footing again.” Jeff Bezos didn’t specify how he’ll do that but said, “I have a bunch of ideas and I’m working on that right now.” “We’ve saved the Washington Post once,” Bezos added, and “this will be the second time.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

The slowdown in the job market appears to have affected the most prestigious Ivy League institutes. According to a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report, at least 23 per cent of job-seeking Harvard MBA students who graduated last year were still looking for a job, three months after leaving the campus. The unemployment rate among fresh graduates has increased steadily in recent years with 20 per cent unable to land a job in 2023 and 10 per cent in 2022. The trend extends beyond the Harvard Business School (HBS) with other elite business schools such as Stanford, Wharton, and NYU Stern also reporting some of the weakest job-placement rates. "We're not immune to the difculties of the job market. Going to Harvard is not going to be a differentiator. You have to have the skills," explained Kisten Fitzpatrick, who oversees career development and alumni relations for HBS. Amazon, Google and Microsoft have reduced MBA recruiting, as have consulting firms, the report highlighted. To salvage the situation, Harvard is now testing an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can compare job seekers' resumes with their preferred roles and recommend online classes to bridge skill gap. While the job market is bad, students who have lowered their expectations have managed to find jobs unlike those still waiting for the top firms to come their way. "Most of my friends who tempered their expectations were able to land great positions. HBS students (are) self-selecting out of certain jobs that may be seen as a 'step down' from their roles before the MBA despite them being perfectly great well-paying jobs," an unnamed HBS MBA student was quoted as saying by Forbes. "HBS students tend to come from wealthier families and backgrounds that can stomach a few months of unemployment."

Wednesday's stock rally sent Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) shares surging 3.3%, driven higher by a broader tech sector surge after four banks reported stronger earnings than expected. The latest strategic investment by Nvidia shows its bravery towards industrial AI and robotics. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. The chip giant has also provided Taiwan's MetAI with capital in its $4 million seed funding round, making Nvidia its first investment in a Taiwanese company. Kenmec Mechanical Engineering, Solomon Technology, SparkLabs Taiwan, Addin Ventures, and Upstream Ventures were other participants in the funding round. MetAI builds AI-powered digital twin platforms for its own advanced semiconductor manufacturing facilities, smart warehouses, and automation systems. It converts a CAD file into a stripped-down SimReady 3D environment within minutes to ease the time to market digital twins for industrial applications. As generative physical AI is an area of increasing focus, Nvidia's partnership with MetAI is a holistic approach to the integration of predictive physical AI that can be trained in simulation environments to deploy robots in autonomous systems. Later this year, the company launched its Mega framework within the Omniverse platform to further digital twin products in the company's broader AI ecosystem.

Title: Meta just flipped the switch that prevents misinformation from spreading in the United States
URL: https://www.platformer.news/meta-ends-misinformation-enforcement-zuckerberg/
Time Published: 2025-01-16T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
The company built effective systems to reduce the reach of fake news. Last week, it shut them down I. Last week, Meta announced a series of changes to its content moderation policies and enforcement strategies designed to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration. The company ended its fact-checking program in the United States, stopped scanning new posts for most policy violations, and created carve-outs in its community standards to allow dehumanizing speech about transgender people and immigrants. The company also killed its diversity, equity and inclusion program. Behind the scenes, the company was also quietly dismantling a system to prevent the spread of misinformation. When the company announced on Jan. 7 that it would end its fact-checking partnerships, the company also instructed teams responsible for ranking content in the company’s apps to stop penalizing misinformation, according to sources and an internal document obtained by Platformer. The result is that the sort of viral hoaxes that ran roughshod over the platform during the 2016 US presidential election — “Pope Francis endorses Trump,” Pizzagate, and all the rest — are now just as eligible for free amplification on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads as true stories. In 2016, of course, Meta hadn’t yet invested huge sums in machine-learning classifiers that can spot when a piece of viral content is likely a hoax. But nine years later, after the company’s own analyses found that these classifiers could reduce the reach of these hoaxes by more than 90 percent, Meta is shutting them off. Meta declined to comment on the changes. Instead, it pointed me to a letter and a blog post in which it had hinted that this change was coming. The letter was sent in August by Zuckerberg to Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. In it, Zuckerberg expressed his discomfort with the Biden Administration’s efforts to pressure the company to remove certain posts about COVID-19. Zuckerberg also expressed regret that the company had temporarily reduced the distribution of stories about Hunter Biden’s laptop, which Meta and Twitter had both done out of fear that they had been the result of a Russian hack-and-leak operation. The few hours that the story’s distribution was limited would go on to become a Republican cause célèbre. As a kind of retroactive apology for bowing to censorship requests in the past, and for the company’s own actions in the Hunter Biden case, Zuckerberg said that going forward, the company would no longer reduce the reach of posts that had been sent to fact checkers but not yet evaluated. Once they had been evaluated, Meta would continue to reduce the reach of posts that had been designated as false. In hindsight, this turned out to be the first step toward killing off Meta’s misinformation efforts: granting hoaxes a temporary window for expanded reach while they awaited fact checking. That brings us to the blog post: Joel Kaplan’s “More speech, fewer mistakes,” which was published last Tuesday and among other things announced the end of the company’s US fact-checking partnerships. Buried toward the bottom were these two sentences: At the time, Kaplan did not elaborate on which of these demotions the company planned to get rid of. Platformer can now confirm that misinformation-related demotions have been eliminated at the company. The company plans to replace its professional fact-checking program with volunteers from the user base appending information to posts in a system modeled after X’s community notes. But Meta has offered few details on how the program will work, and has not said when it will become available. As a result, Meta has chosen to open a window for viral hoaxes to spread unchecked on its properties while it works to build a new system to mitigate their impact. II. Meta’s efforts to detect misinformation had their roots in the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election. In response to outrage over the spread of “Pope endorses Trump” and other hoaxes in the run-up to Trump’s election, Meta promised lawmakers and regulators around the world that it would take steps to improve the quality of information on its platforms. From the start of that initiative, Meta’s integrity teams worked hand-in-hand with the third-party fact checkers it hired after the election. In a 2018 blog post, the company explained the variety of signals it used to determine whether its ranking algorithms might be showing you something false: Notably, none of these changes actually eliminated anyone’s freedom of expression. Instead, they restricted what the technologist Aza Raskin has termed “freedom of reach.” Fact-checking and down-ranking obviously false stories allowed liars and hoaxsters to express themselves but sought to limit the negative effects of those lies on Meta’s customers. In May 2020, at the height of the pandemic, Meta boasted about how well this effort was working. In a blog post, the company said that 95 percent of people who saw labels warning that a post contained misinformation declined to view it. The company said that in March 2020 alone, it displayed warnings related to COVID-19 on 40 million posts. Going forward, Meta will instead ask users to add their own annotations to these and other posts. Academics, journalists, lawmakers, and other interested parties will undoubtedly still conduct their own reviews of viral posts on Meta platforms in the coming months to assess the misinformation landscape. But they’ll be doing it without a critical tool they used in the past: CrowdTangle, a free services that exposed what posts on Facebook and Instagram were most popular via searchable real-time dashboards. Meta killed off CrowdTangle in August, directing users instead to an alternative that lacks many of CrowdTangle’s core features. In publishing this story, I realize that I may be giving ammo to those who believe that misinformation is a root cause of our polarization in the United States. As Joe Bernstein wrote in Harper’s 2021, discussions of misinformation sometimes lend too much credence to the idea that algorithms are all-powerful shapers of reality, and fail to reckon with the fact that people will always seek out information that aligns with their worldview. Their demand for that information, whether it is true or false, may be the most important factor leading to its creation and its spread. But it’s possible to believe that a total fixation on misinformation is counterproductive and also believe in the idea of harm reduction: that sophisticated systems that accurately identify hoaxes and then show them to fewer people ought to be left in place, at least until their replacement has been rolled out and evaluated for its effectiveness. For now, these changes only apply to the United States — though you get the sense that Zuckerberg would happily roll them out anywhere else he’s allowed to.

Title: Bannon vs Musk: How Trump’s U-turn on H-1B visas has split MAGA
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/1/16/bannon-vs-musk-how-trumps-u-turn-on-h-1b-visas-has-split-maga
Time Published: 2025-01-16T05:18:29Z
Full Content:
Trump’s tech allies Musk and Ramaswamy are at loggerheads with the MAGA camp over a visa programme that brings foreign workers. Days before Donald Trump is sworn in as president of the United States, a feud between his tech allies and champions of his far-right MAGA (Make America Great Again) agenda over H-1B visas has exploded. Former White House adviser Steve Bannon accused Elon Musk of trying to establish “techno-feudalism on a global scale” in a fresh broadside against the billionaire businessman this week. Bannon’s sharp rhetoric against the controversial visa programme, which allows the hiring of highly skilled tech workers from overseas, has come as others in Trump’s orbit, such as entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, have also tried to argue that US companies need trained foreign employees. That argument has come under fire not just from Bannon, but also from other far-right supporters of Trump – even as Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with cutting government spending in his new administration, have now softened their position on H-1B visas. Following the backlash, the tech barons have said that the programme needs to be reformed. But what is the H-1B scheme that is splitting Trump’s allies? Why is it so divisive? Has Trump’s own U-turn on the issue contributed to tensions within the MAGA movement? And how will Trump manage the division between his MAGA base and Big Tech – a sector that traditionally leaned towards the Democrats but has in recent weeks almost bent over backwards to placate the incoming president? The H-1B is a temporary and non-immigrant US visa that allows companies in the US to bring in highly skilled workers from abroad. In 2016, Trump called the programme, which was introduced in the 1990s under Republican President George HW Bush, “very, very bad” for American workers. Months before the end of his first term as president in 2020, Trump imposed a temporary ban on H-1B visas, which was later struck down by a federal court. But less than five years later, the US president-elect has thrown his weight behind the visa scheme, saying: “It’s a great programme.” “I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B,” he told New York Post. Those comments came at a time when Musk was facing pushback from MAGA supporters. Musk played a key role in Trump’s win as he pumped money into the presidential campaign and used X to megaphone hardline MAGA views. That has earned him Trump’s goodwill and influence. But Trump has pushed back on the notion that Musk enjoys outsized influence. “And no, he’s not taking the presidency,” Trump made the comments during a speech in December, days after the Tesla owner led efforts to kill a spending bill in Congress. Experts say Trump will need to manage a delicate balance between the Silicon Valley elite, whom he needs for his plans to create jobs, and the MAGA base, from where he draws his political support. The H-1B is “the largest temporary work visa” programme in the US, said Jeanne Batalova, a senior policy analyst at Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, DC-headquartered think tank. There is an annual cap on the number of H-1B visas guaranteed, set to 65,000 H-1B visas per fiscal year. It is decided by a lottery system, which randomly selects when the number of visa petitions exceeds the cap. The foreign worker must be employed in a specialised occupation with at least a bachelor’s degree. The employer sponsors foreign workers from the fields of information technology, medicine and publication. The visa is granted for three years but can be extended to six years. American and Indian tech companies – and a few consulting firms – dominate the scheme. Six of the top 10 beneficiaries of the scheme in 2024 were US companies, according to the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), a nonpartisan think tank on trade and immigration: Amazon, Cognizant, IBM, Microsoft, Google and Meta. Three are Indian: Infosys, TCS and HCL. Capgemini, a French tech and consulting firm, rounds up the list. But there is another, major new beneficiary of the scheme, per the NFAP’s data: Musk’s electric car giant Tesla. In 2024, Tesla won 742 new H-1B visas through the lottery, more than double the 328 it secured in 2023. In addition, Tesla had another 1,025 existing H-1B visas extended in 2024. “Due to data limitations, we don’t have a good sense of the total H-1B visa holders currently in the US. However, as of 2019, close to 600,000 highly skilled immigrants worked in the US economy on H-1B visas. Approximately 120,000 immigrant workers received new H-1B visas in 2024,” Batalova said. However, it isn’t just MAGA advocates who are critical of the scheme. Ronil Hira, an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at Howard University, said that the H-1B programme needs to be reformed. Problems plaguing the programme, he said, include the poor selection process, where “eligibility standards are too low, so the application lottery is flooded”, and “visa winners are selected by lottery instead of rational criteria”. The recent argument began when far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer criticised Trump’s pick for artificial intelligence (AI) adviser, Sriram Krishnan, who has argued the US needs more foreign skilled workers to remain competitive in the technology industries. On December 28, Musk threatened to “go to war” on the issue. “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H-1B,” Musk posted. Musk was born in South Africa and previously held an H-1B visa before he became a naturalised US citizen. Ramaswamy jumped on the debate, saying that technology companies hire foreign-born employees because of a difference in culture. “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,” he wrote, without mentioning the H-1B visa. But he later clarified that the H-1B system “is badly broken [and] should be replaced”. Bannon, who served under Trump’s previous term, has called the H-1B programme a “total scam” as it allows tech companies to bring cheap labour from abroad at the cost of American workers. He has called for the deportation of H-1B visa holders as part of the wider deportation plans. He railed particularly against Musk, saying the Tesla owner’s “sole objective is to become a trillionaire. That’s his objective,” Bannon told the Italian newspaper, Corriere della Sera, on January 8 “He will do anything related to make sure that any one of his companies is protected or has a better deal or he makes more money. His aggregation of wealth, and then – through wealth – power: that’s what he’s focused on. The American working people in this country are not going to tolerate it.” Batalova explained that immigration has long been a contentious policy area in the US. There are “two existential perspectives battling over the hearts and minds of the American public and voters”, she said. She elaborated that one perspective perceives immigrant workers, such as those on H-1B visas, as contributors to US economic power and global competitiveness. The other perspective views immigrant workers as competitors for jobs and limited economic resources. Batalova added that this struggle has, at the moment, resurged and is “fuelled in big part by voter discontent of how the government handled immigration after the COVID-19 pandemic, but also discussions about economic security and national competitiveness, particularly regarding China”. “Major tech companies and business groups continue to lobby for expanding the programme, arguing it is crucial for maintaining America’s innovative edge. However, layoffs in the tech sector, combined with cases of worker replacement at various companies, have provided ammunition for H-1B critics.” Criticism of the H-1B visa has also come from the left. On December 29, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna told Fox News that the H-1B needs to be reformed. “You can’t underpay these H-1B folks coming in,” Khanna said. The programme “shouldn’t be for accountants or entry-level IT jobs. It should really be for exceptional talent. We should have that balance”. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has also criticised the H-1B visa programme. “The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire ‘the best and the brightest,’ but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad,” he posted on X. Elon Musk is wrong. The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire “the best and the brightest,” but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad. The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make. pic.twitter.com/Mwz7i9TcSM — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) January 2, 2025 Around 70 percent of H-1B visa recipients are from India and another 10 percent are from China. As the debate rages in the US, some tech firms have withdrawn job offers to Indian workers, according to a report in the Indian newspaper, Times of India. But India’s Ministry of External Affairs argued that H-1B visas benefit both countries. “India-US economic ties benefit a lot from the technical expertise provided by skilled professionals, with both sides leveraging their strengths and competitive value. We look forward to further deepening India-US economic ties, which are to our mutual benefit,” Randhir Jaiswal, India’s foreign ministry spokesperson, said during a news conference on January 3. Trump’s campaign promises during the election comprised a hardline immigration policy. He has threatened to carry out mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and boost security at the border to prevent asylum seekers from entering the country. A month after he was voted in, he told NBC’s Kristen Welker on a Meet the Press episode that he plans to end birthright citizenship in the US, a policy that has been in place for more than 150 years. The right is guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution. However, during the interview, the president-elect said he was willing to work with Democrats to keep “Dreamers”, undocumented people who arrived in the US as children and have lived in the country most of their lives. When it comes to the H-1B visa in Trump’s second term, “no one knows what Trump will do. He did nothing in his first term even though he campaigned to reform the programme. It was a glaring unfulfilled promise”, Hira, of Howard University, said. “The Republicans control Congress [both House and Senate] and the White House, so they have the power to change the programme for better or for worse, or keep the status quo. Will they exercise that power for change? Internal political calculations will dictate the direction they take.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

Investing.com-- Seaport upgraded its rating on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) on Wednesday, citing expectations for higher subscriber growth as the streaming giant prepares to report its fourth-quarter earnings next week. Seaport upgraded Netflix to Buy from Neutral, with a price target of $955- representing an upside of 12.5% from Wednesday’s close. The brokerage said it expects higher than initially anticipated additions in members- at 9 million in the fourth quarter, compared to prior expectations of 5.7 million. Seaport also sees Netflix’s original content providing strong tailwinds to the stock, especially with the release of the second season of smash hit Squid Games during the quarter. The brokerage said advertising growth, more top content projects and the winning of live sports rights- such as the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson match- all heralded a positive quarter. “NFLX should remain a core holding due to top-line growth, OI margin expansion, and FCF conversion,” Seaport analysts wrote in a note. Netflix will report its December quarter earnings on January 21. The company is expected to clock earnings per share of $4.2 on revenue of $10.13 billion.

Title: NetApp sells Spot and CloudCheckr to cloud cost control company Flexera
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/01/15/netapp-sells-spot-cloudcheckr-cloud-cost-control-company-flexera/
Time Published: 2025-01-16T01:50:06Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 20:50 EST / JANUARY 15 2025 by Mike Wheatley NetApp Inc. is selling a portfolio of its software assets to the cloud cost management specialist Flexera Software LLC. Today’s announcement revealed that Flexera will acquire parts of NetApp’s Spot by NetApp and CloudCheckr products in a deal. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it’s valued at about $100 million, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg noted that the sale likely follows a decision by NetApp to streamline its business and double down on its core operations, in line with a wider industry trend. It added that global asset sales increased by 26% in 2024, rising to almost $555 billion. Spot and CloudCheckr’s tools are used by companies to keep track of the cost of using different cloud computing services. In the case of Spot, it provides continuous automation, optimization and insights around customer’s cloud infrastructure investments, helping them to maximize their cloud resource usage. NetApp bought Spot in 2020 for an undisclosed price, with reports at the time saying it paid in excess of $450 million. Flexera specializes in cloud service orchestration, policy management and cost optimization tools. As such, managing cloud environments is its core business, which may make it a better fit for Spot. In contrast, NetApp is more focused on providing unified data storage that spans cloud and on-premises data center environments. It has some big ambitions to create an intelligent data infrastructure to support generative AI workloads. In addition, it also sells data center hardware based on all-flash storage systems. NAND Research Inc. analyst Steve McDowell told SiliconANGLE that when NetApp acquired Spot almost five years ago, it was focused on building a cloud operations business. “Since that time, NetApp has refined its cloud strategy and today it’s more focused on bringing ONTAP to the public cloud, and it has been one of the more successful cloud storage stories in the industry,” the analyst said. “NetApp is no longer trying to be in the cloud operations business, so that made Spot an awkward fit.” The only slight downside to the deal for NetApp is the reported price it received for Spot. “We don’t know what NetApp’s revenue from Spot was over the past five years, so it’s impossible to know if it broke even,” McDowell added. “I suspect it didn’t, but the sale is still a much better option than just shutting the business down.” Flexera Chief Executive Jim Ryan said the acquisition of Spot will improve its ability to “tackle the proliferation of hybrid cloud cost and usage challenges across public cloud, data centers, SaaS and even AI.” “Acquiring Spot gives Flexera a stellar set of mature cloud FinOps capabilities that it can quickly deploy to its customers,” McDowell said. “It’s a great acquisition for the company, adding new capabilities that give it a really comprehensive set of features for its customers.” Investors seemed to approve of the sale, with NetApp’s stock closing the day up 1.5%, giving it a market capitalization of about $24 billion. In the last year, its stock has risen 35%. Flexera is a privately held firm that was acquired by the equity firm Thoma Bravo LLC in 2020. TA Associates LLC and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board are also said to hold minority stakes in the company.
