From heavy hitters such as Electric Picnic and Dublin Theatre Festival to more esoteric gatherings, the Irish festival calendar has something for everyone. The list below offers just a taste of the cultural showcases coming up in 2025. Lots of festivals won’t announce their programmes until later in the year, so keep an eye on their websites and social media. The Chinese Year of the Snake symbolises wisdom, transformation and resilience. As snakes shed their skin through sloughing, they are symbols of rebirth, immortality and healing. The Lunar New Year celebrations culminate on Sunday, February 2nd, with the festival’s flagship event, a day of festivities in Meeting House Square.

Honouring the Celtic goddess Brigid, who embodies inspiration, healing, magic, smithcraft, wisdom, poetry, protection, fire and earth, it showcases women’s contributions, past and present, with a citywide programme spotlighting women’s stories, underscoring their impact on society and heralding the arrival of spring.

Title: Elegant Victorian with showstopper potential on Donnybrook’s Marlborough Road for €1.95m

In their lifetime, many of the large Victorian properties on Marlborough Road in Donnybrook have transitioned from family homes to flats and back again. Number 102, which was built in 1856, falls somewhere in between. It has been owned by the same family for several years, and has been adapted over time for different life stages. While it is not set out in self-contained units per se, separate living spaces have been created inside the two-storey over-basement redbrick. With a floor area of 285sq m (3,067sq ft) and a total of six bedrooms, the Dublin 4 property is in good condition, with many original features intact and well-maintained. It is on the market through Mullery O’Gara with an asking price of €1.95 million. Marlborough Road is a long, tree-lined street in Dublin 4 with Morehampton Road at one end and Sandford Road at the other, effectively connecting Donnybrook and Ranelagh villages. Most homes along the road that were converted into flats in years gone by have now been returned to family homes. Taking number 102 back to a family home in its entirety would not require too much work. The house has not been carved out into individual flats, so new owners could move in following a little reconfiguring. The granite steps lead up to the main entrance, with the Victorian architecture evident from the minute you walk into the hallway. The ornate coving, detailed architraves and original stained-glass window have all been restored and showcased. [ Double-fronted Victorian home close to the sea in Clontarf for €2.495mOpens in new window ] To the left is the drawingroom, which has not lost any of its grandeur during the property’s many guises, with high ceilings, sash windows and the original granite fireplace remaining the standout features. Straight ahead is a study with a long sash window looking out over the rear garden. Beside this is a less formal reception room with a beautiful marble fireplace. The independent living spaces are downstairs at garden level. There is a separate entrance to this floor that has two bedrooms with their own bathrooms and living areas with kitchenette. If new owners wished to turn this house back to a cohesive home, this level would probably be where they would house the kitchen with access to the garden. With the 32m-long south-facing garden, extending further out would be an option, subject to planning permission. There are many homes on the road that have done exactly this, so a quick knock into the neighbours may provide some design inspiration. Out front, there is parking for several cars in the gravel driveway. Although the road can get busy, particularly with school runs in the morning, the house is set back enough for the passing cars to go more or less unnoticed. Upstairs on the first floor there are four bedrooms, each with a cast-iron fireplace. There is also a shower room and separate WC that would benefit from an upgrade. [ Modernised, light-filled home minutes from Blackrock village for €1.395mOpens in new window ] There is so much potential at number 102 to create a home that will grow with a family, from toddlers needing room to play to young adults looking for a bit of independence within the home. The property is Ber-exempt, but as it currently uses electric storage heaters, new owners will probably want to investigate retrofitting. Recent sales on the road include number 59, which sold last summer for more than €1.515 million, according to the Property Price Register. This was a midterrace two-storey-over-basement property that was set out in flats and in need of renovation. Number 75 sold for €1.925 million last September. It was also midterrace and smaller than number 102, but restored to a high level. Interest in Marlborough Road is not just for the fine houses. The location in Dublin 4 is a huge pull when it comes to potential buyers. The street may feel exclusive and private, yet it is only 3km from St Stephen’s Green. For families with children of school-going age, Muckross Park College is on the road, while Sandford Park and Gonzaga are just across the way. Herbert Park is a short walk away, as are Donnybrook and Ranelagh villages. At weekends and on long summer evenings, the kids can turn left and be at Scoop in Ranelagh for a gelato in five minutes, while the adults can turn right and enjoy the short walk to Donnybrook Fair for a more sophisticated treat.

Title: Upgraded and extended home in Clonskeagh for €1.25m

Number 2 Beechmount Drive was a very different house in 2015. When the current owners bought the property 10 years ago, it had been lived in by two friends. The friends divided the house in two so they could both have their own living spaces, which resulted in a house that had two of everything, from doorbells to bathrooms. It has since undergone a complete renovation, with not much left of the original house, bar the door frame and the external walls at the front. The ground floor was extended, and the garage was converted, with extra accommodation added above it. With a floor area of 205sq m (2,207sq ft), the semidetached home is on the market through DNG, seeking €1.25m. The new layout downstairs caters for every situation. At the back is a large open-plan kitchen with units by Glenwise in Kimmage. There is enough room for a living area and dining area, which is ideal when entertaining. Through sliding pocket doors is a cosy TV room with bespoke storage units, also making it a good option for a playroom. At the front of the house is a livingroom with solid-fuel stove and an office on the other side of the hallway. There is also a guest loo and utility room on the ground floor. Upstairs there are three double bedrooms. The original box room was taken out and used as an en suite and dressingroom for the main bedroom, as well as to make room for a staircase up to the converted attic. The main bathroom has a separate bath and shower, and the attic has also been plumbed, so new owners could add another bathroom. [ Double-fronted Victorian home close to the sea in Clontarf for €2.495mOpens in new window ] The house was renovated with a view that the owners would stay forever, so they put the best of everything into it. There are small things in the house that will make a big difference to daily life such as the laundry chute in the hot press upstairs that goes down to the utility room, and the charging drawer in the kitchen where you can plug in your devices. The Ber rating was brought up to an impressive B2 following the renovations, which included high levels of insulation, the installation of underfloor heating on the ground floor as well as solar panels on the roof that heat the water. An electric car charging point has also been fitted in the front driveway. Double doors from the kitchen open out to a patio, which steps down to the lawn of the 40m garden. The mature trees in neighbouring gardens create a real sense of privacy when out in the east-facing garden. [ Modernised, light-filled home minutes from Blackrock village for €1.395mOpens in new window ] The area is very popular with families as it has schools, parks, playgrounds, UCD and cafes. Windy Arbour Luas stop is a five-minute walk away. The bus stop around the corner from the house on Bird Avenue is served by the new S4 bus route that runs from UCD to Liffey Valley, as well as the 142, which starts in Portmarnock and ends at UCD. When the owners completed the project on their home on Beechmount Drive, they thought they would never leave. Their heads have been turned by another house in need of renovation, however, so they feel the time is right to get their hands dirty once again.

Title: Chasing the Don: How EU politicians are jockeying for position with Trump

From Nigel Farage to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, here are the competitors for the position of Europe's Trump whisperer. By NICHOLAS VINOCUR and JACOPO BARIGAZZI AI generated Text-to-speech Europe has discovered a new competitive sport: jockeying to get close to United States President Donald Trump. The first high-stakes interaction seemed to go badly. The fiery phone call between Trump and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was so alarming that she promptly set off on a European tour to shore up support in Berlin, Brussels and Paris against America seizing Greenland. For other leaders, the big fear is that the newly installed president could impose punishing tariffs. But will he actually listen? Is there anyone in Brussels or elsewhere in Europe who really has his ear? European politicians are lining up to explain why they should be the ones to “interpret” the bloc’s thorny politics to the U.S. president. The invitation list for his inauguration, however, suggested the Trump camp was closer to several far-right politicians than mainstream national leaders. In an attempt to shed light on who stands where in Trump’s international pecking order, POLITICO has put together a guide to the key aspiring “Trump whisperers” in Europe and ranked them on their “Trump-compatibility.” Here we go: When it comes to currying favor with Trump, Italy’s right-wing prime minister is at the front of the line. Before she became the only European Union leader to be invited to Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, Meloni met with the Republican leader during a huddle facilitated by tech billionaire Elon Musk at the reopening of the fire-damaged Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris in December. Then there was a private huddle earlier this month at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, following which he called Meloni “a fantastic woman” and gave her a domestic win by helping her negotiate a hostage release in Iran. Trump’s willingness to meet Meloni face-to-face puts her in a league of her own in terms of access compared to other European leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron or German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Significantly, Meloni’s foreign minister is one of only four EU ministers to have spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio since Jan. 20. That said, it remains to be seen just how deep Meloni’s connection goes. She also maintained close ties with the administration of previous U.S. President Joe Biden before Trump’s election victory, a point that may be held against her by Trump’s MAGA entourage. Another black mark: Italy’s defense spending, which is below 2 percent of gross domestic product and will shrink in 2025, is far from Trump’s desired goal of 5 percent of GDP for European countries. Finally, Meloni’s coziness with Musk could become a disadvantage if the tech mogul suddenly loses sway with Trump. But what look like drawbacks may well help Meloni in the end, argues Beniamino Irdi, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council. Low defense spending “puts her in the unique position of being perhaps the only one amongst the bad players [like Spain or Belgium] who speaks the same language as Trump. And she has a very big stake in trying to valorize this affinity,” he said. — By Hannah Roberts Trump compatibility score: Hungary’s strongman leader is another contender for the position of Trump’s “chief whisperer” in Europe. The illiberal ruler of Hungary bagged not one but two invitations to Mar-a-Lago in 2024, and has been effusive in his praise of the MAGA leader for years. Trump has returned the favor by repeatedly name-checking Orbán in his speeches, even calling him a “great man.” There are also extensive contacts between Trump allies in Washington and Orbán’s friends in Budapest, who contributed to the “Project 2025” plan for Trump’s second term prepared by the right-wing Heritage Foundation think tank. However, Orbán’s pro-Russian and pro-Chinese policies may put a serious damper on his popularity with Trump in office. While Trump threatens sanctions against Russia to force it to stop its war against Ukraine, Hungary has stood in the way, this week threatening to block the rollover of EU sanctions against Moscow. Orbán has also gone out of his way to court Chinese business interests, inviting Beijing-backed corporations to build railways and electric vehicle factories in his country. What’s more, the prime minister has publicly pushed back on Trump’s request that EU countries spend 5 percent of their GDP on defense. At this stage, even the Hungarians are hedging about their Trump-compatibility. “The question of becoming a bridge between the U.S. administration and the EU is relevant only if the U.S. administration is looking for such a bridge, which cannot be taken for granted,” said János Bóka, Hungary’s EU affairs minister. Hungary doesn’t “pretend to speak on behalf of the European Union, and we don’t pretend to have a mandate to negotiate or to facilitate any agreement between the European Union and the United States,” he told a small group of journalists last week. Move to the back of the line, Viktor. — By Jacopo Barigazzi Trump compatibility score: These Polish right-wingers are as MAGA-compatible as it gets. Speaking to POLITICO in December, Morawiecki said that together with Italian Prime Minister Meloni, he would be “an ideal intermediary between the United States and Europe.” That must have pleased some people close to Trump because Morawiecki, along with other hard-right EU politicians, scored an invitation to the inauguration. To prove his loyalty, Morawiecki posted a picture of himself in front of Trump and Vice President JD Vance, writing that a “wind of change” was blowing “faster and faster toward Poland.” Duda, for his part, is among the European leaders Trump knows best after meeting him several times during his first term. (That said, Duda is leaving office in May, and Trump didn’t have any time to spare for him in September when he abruptly canceled a planned meeting.) For now, Poland’s MAGA allies are playing second fiddle to Meloni, even though Warsaw is doing far better than Rome in terms of defense spending. The big question now is whether one of Duda and Morawiecki’s allies will win a presidential election in May. If Karol Nawrocki, who is backed by their Law and Justice party, becomes Polish president, the bridge to Trump may be preserved. If not, that privilege will likely be lost to Poland’s current prime minister, Donald Tusk. — By Nick Vinocur Trump compatibility score: The Brexiteer-in-chief has long boasted of his friendship with Trump, celebrating the latter’s win on election night in Mar-a-Lago and joining the inauguration glitz as part of a cast of global right-wingers. He has even talked up the idea he would do a better job as U.S. ambassador than Britain’s actual pick — and Trump has returned the favor by praising him as a “handsome” man after his own image. The pair’s politics are firmly aligned, and Farage has long plied the same smash-the-establishment message as Trump as he tries to unsettle Britain’s Labour government. Yet it’s not all sweetness and light: The Reform UK leader has found himself decidedly out of favor of late with Trump’s right hand man, Musk, with the pair clashing over Musk’s backing of a jailed British far-right agitator deemed too extreme for Farage. Add to that the fact that Farage isn’t a head of state or government and comes from an island nation that has commanded steadily less of Trump’s attention. — By Matt Honeycombe-Foster Trump compatibility score: The French far-right flamethrower’s relationship with Trump dates back to at least 2022, when Éric Zemmour let it be known that he was getting political advice from the man who would become the 47th president of the United States. The revelation came as something of a surprise. Though Zemmour had modeled his presidential campaign on Trump’s, embracing the role of a culture warrior unafraid to create buzz by being controversial, the then-ex president’s reputation was at its lowest. At the time, a Trump return to the White House seemed a pipe dream after a second impeachment, making the idea of the French commentator-turned-presidential-candidate’s aligning himself with a disgraced leader seem foolish. Zemmour’s campaign eventually petered out, and so did his political relevance. So it came as a surprise when POLITICO discovered that Zemmour and his political and romantic partner, member of the European Parliament Sarah Knafo, had got their hands on tickets to the inauguration. In terms of politics, Trump and Zemmour aren’t a perfect fit, as Trump’s protectionist economic beliefs align better with Marine Le Pen’s far-right movement, the National Rally, than with those of Zemmour’s party, Reconquest. But Trump has made it clear he values loyalty and respect, and it was Zemmour who reached out during the president’s darkest days. — By Clea Caulcutt Trump compatibility score: A teacher by trade who embodies plucky bonhomie, Rutte isn’t the most obvious sparring partner for Trump. But thanks to his lengthy leadership experience in the Netherlands, where he was prime minister for 14 years, and his current big job at NATO, Mark Rutte may be at the front of the line when it comes to whispering in POTUS’s ear. Quite simply, Rutte is the man Trump is relying on to force Europeans to start spending more on defense. The Dutchman has taken to this role with relish, telling locals that Donald is “right” when it comes to Europeans taking more responsibility for their own defense, and warning them that Russia may be knocking on their doors next if they fail to step up. He’s also one of the few Europeans to have been invited to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence. To be sure, Trump held back on praising Rutte after their meeting. The Dutchman is also a lifelong centrist and doesn’t share any obvious ideological similarities with Trump. But Rutte, like Trump, is a dealmaker who has something to offer. And that could prove more valuable in the long run than political alignment. — By Nick Vinocur Trump compatibility score: This pairing isn’t a natural fit for Trump. As former head of the European Council (an institution Trump has taken to ignoring) and an opponent of the Law and Justice party, Donald Tusk is at odds with Trump’s natural hard-right allies in Poland (see above). Meanwhile, Radosław Sikorski is an Atlanticist whose wife, The Atlantic writer Anne Applebaum, is a prominent Trump critic. However, as with Rutte, Trump’s need to engage with key defensive players in Europe means the U.S. president may look beyond any ideological difference and end up having more to do with this pair than with other EU leaders. Indeed, Sikorski was one of the first European foreign ministers to speak to Marco Rubio following his confirmation as secretary of state. It helps that Poland is on course to meet Trump’s defense spending target of 5 percent of GDP before any other European country, making Warsaw “top of the class” in Washington’s eyes. Some commentators have latched on to this fact, dubbing Tusk the “most likely to become Trump’s whisperer” in Europe. What could spoil the party, however, is if Law and Justice candidate Nawrocki becomes Polish president in an upcoming election. — By Nick Vinocur Trump compatibility score: Friedrich Merz’s connection with Trump is all about power and position. Put simply, Merz is on course to become leader of Europe’s top economy, which would make him a natural counterpart for the U.S. president. Merz himself has recognized this role, saying in an interview last week that “Germany must take on a leading role” in negotiations with Trump. This could happen, he has said, if Germany bought F-35 fighter jets from the U.S. but maintained them at home, building any necessary factories: “That would be a good deal for both sides,” he claimed. The conservative heavyweight’s confidence seems to flow mostly from his business background. Merz is a corporate lawyer by trade who has spent most of the past two decades quietly stewing while sitting on company boards — including at BlackRock — and making a small fortune. He’s also known for bashing the progressive left for its gender debates while talking up his anti-immigration credentials. Remarkably, he has been spared from the attacks of Musk, who has referred to the incumbent center-left chancellor, Scholz, as “a fool,” while endorsing far-right German politician Alice Weidel. Whether Merz will be capable of turning the page when it comes to dealing with Trump remains questionable. Trump notoriously detested former Chancellor Angela Merkel, and while Merz tried to approach Trump via a handwritten letter congratulating him on his inauguration, there has been no known contact between the two men. That said, Trump likes power. And as of Feb. 24, Merz may well be Europe’s most powerful politician. — By Nette Nöstlinger Trump compatibility score: The French president is giving Trump a dose of “je t’aime, moi non plus.” (“I love you, me neither,” the title of an old Serge Gainsbourg/Brigitte Bardot song.) After rushing to congratulate Trump on his election victory in November, Emmanuel Macron also warned that Europe needs to start flexing its muscles if it wants to earn the respect of the new U.S. president. Macron was not present at Trump’s inauguration, nor did he receive an official invitation, according to French diplomats. But insiders point to Trump’s decision to attend the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral as a sign of Macron’s influence with the new U.S. administration. It was on the sidelines of that visit that Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the future of U.S. support for Kyiv. Macron’s tough-love approach might work with the Donald, who clearly appeared to enjoy knuckle-crunching handshakes with the French president in his first mandate (these handshake battles have also resumed). Trump has called Macron a “very nice guy” but also a “wise guy,” and loves to boast that he got Macron to fold in an escalating trade war with France. But with Trump putting even more emphasis on allegiance in his second mandate, it’s unlikely Macron has the right recipe to get through to him. — By Clea Caulcutt Trump compatibility score: This trio is at the top of the food chain when it comes to power in the EU institutions. For Trump, however, they’re at the bottom of the pile of preferred foreign partners. Commenting on Trump’s preference for engaging with national leaders rather than with the EU, one EU diplomat said: “He’s clearly shown that he wants to do bilateral relations. This may be a negotiating tactic, as he knows he will have to deal with the EU on trade, but it’s potentially problematic.” Indeed, in the face of Trump’s cold shoulder, top EU representatives are trying out two — seemingly contradictory — strategies. The first is to signal openness to engage with Trump, and Kaja Kallas invited his top diplomat to attend a high-level European gathering. The second is to signal to Trump that Europe has relationships with other powerful countries around the world, as Ursula von der Leyen did in a recent speech in Davos, Switzerland, where she touted EU relations with India and Latin America over the United States. At the end of the day, Trump will have to speak to the EU. But the first days of his presidency have made it clear where he places the bloc on his list of priorities: Way down at the bottom. — By Nick Vinocur Trump compatibility score:

Title: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Reports 33% QoQ EPS Growth in Q3 2024, Driven by Exceptional Profitability and AI Innovation

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs’ 35 AI Superstars. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. In September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures. Although the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements—especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. However, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation. While dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. However, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector. Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market’s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. There are various reasons why this company makes an excellent investment. For instance, the report for the third quarter of year 2024 reflects the company's exceptional growth in profitability. For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.93, increasing 33% from the previous quarter and a 765% increase from a year ago.

Title: Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas claims to buy more Nvidia shares amid rout on DeepSeek rise, netizens say, ‘good move’

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas bought more Nvidia shares amid the market sell-off following the rise of the Chinese AI app DeepSeek. In a post on the social media platform X, Srinivas said, “I just bought some more NVDA(sic).” Perplexity CEO made this claim while responding to a post on X, where Jim Cramer, a journalist from CNBC raised concerns over Nvidia shares. “There is no silver lining right now with Nvidia though,” Cramer wrote. The United States tech stocks and global stock markets were severely impacted by the low-cost Chinese AI app DeepSeek on Monday, tanking the value of leading chip maker Nvidia by $593 billion, a 17 per cent crash. January 27 marked a record one-day market-cap loss for the Wall Street stock in history, according to LSEG data. DeepSeek hit the Nvidia stocks the hardest, impacting others as well. On January 27, the US tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 3.1 per cent, mainly due to Nvidia's crash, which lost a record 17 per cent overnight, followed by chip maker Broadcom Inc, which went down 17.4 per cent, ChatGPT backer Microsoft down nearly 2.1 per cent, and Google's parent company Alphabet dipped 4.2 per cent, according to a Reuters report. DeepSeek's latest large language models have challenged the dominance of top AI companies by offering similar performance to Meta or OpenAI with reportedly a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek's free app has also taken over ChatGPT on Apple's App Store in several regions, including the US, UK, Australia, Canada, China, and Singapore, impacting tech stocks. Several social media users have reacted to the X post of Srinivas with most of them appreciating his move. One of the users wrote, “You are the silver lining.” “Good move,” added another. “I never believe what my TV says about stocks. I believe myself. And I believe NVDA will go up again. I hold and not selling. Americans need NVDA and don’t care what China does,” another user said. “I mean, that's fair. if there's no silver lining, might as well buy the dip,” one of the users commented. “To the moon,” added another.

Focus is likely to be boosting consumption, thrust in infrastructure spending & job creation. Also, the middle class & the income tax payees are hopeful of some form of tax rebate which could ease their financial situation. Agriculture is also likely to be a key focus area as this sector accounts less than 20% of GDP, but still accounts for almost 55%-60% livelihood. Given the current domestic Economic slowdown, record FII outflow, Rupee hitting record lows along with global macros & the Trump factor, makes it all the more an interesting budget to watch out for.” Dabur India net profit rises marginally to Rs 516 crore consolidated revenue up 3.1 per cent to Rs 3,355 Crore. “With the geopolitical landscape remaining volatile in the short term, shrouded by uncertain macroeconomic indicators, Dabur has decided to revise its strategic Vision cycle from four years to three years to create a more agile organisation that can quickly navigate the challenges and capture the emerging opportunities. We have engaged a leading consulting firm, McKinsey & Co to refine and align our strategies for the next 3 years in line with the evolving dynamics,”Mohit Malhotra, CEO, Dabur India “The word expiry is always accompanied by volatility; seen in the Index that showed a steady start before trending upwards and oscillating within a defined range for most of the session. However, a sharp decline in the afternoon erased all of its earlier gains. In the final hour of trade, a strong recovery helped the Index close higher at 23,249.50 marking a gain of 86.40 points. Among the sectors, Realty and Energy were the top performers, while IT and Media lagged. The Index has broken out of its Falling Wedge formation, suggesting a shift in momentum towards the positive, but the candlestick pattern is not that encouraging. We will wait for further confirmation. For now, the zone of 23,350-23,400 will serve as resistance while support is at 23,065.” “FOMC maintained its target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25%-4.5%. The Fed also made no change to its balance-sheet-reduction program, known as quantitative tightening. Fed Chair Powell took a measured stance in his post-meeting press conference, acknowledging progress in inflation cooling while reiterating that the central bank remains data-dependent. Jerome Powell’s comments did little to alter investor expectations for rate cuts later in the year. This is the first key decision from the central bank under President Donald Trump’s second term and comes after Trump said he should have some say in Fed policy. Trump, prioritizing economic growth and low interest rates, criticized Powell’s independent actions as Federal Reserve Chair. Trump’s focus on immediate economic indicators and boosting the stock market clashed with Powell’s longer-term perspective on inflation control. This strained relationship undermines public trust in the Fed’s independence, a crucial element of its effectiveness. This visible disagreement demonstrated the challenges of balancing political pressures with the central bank’s mandate for economic stability. Fed officials must now determine whether today’s expected pause is a one-meeting hold or the start of a longer stretch.” Ajanta Pharma reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 stood at ₹232.88 crore as against ₹210.03 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Stock closed 1.77% positive on the NSE at ₹2,674.45 Waaree Energies’ consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 stood at ₹506.87 crore as against ₹140.80 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Shares traded flat on the NSE at ₹2,219.45. “Despite government initiatives and customized financing solutions, MSMEs in India continue to face persistent challenges. From delayed payments, limited access to credit, financial illiteracy, and navigating complex regulatory frameworks, these barriers hinder their growth and limit the participation of underserved populations in the expanding economy. To address these issues, we need to look at a multipronged approach. Critical steps include enhancing credit guarantee schemes and fostering innovative financing models, such as revenue-based financing and supply chain finance.Introducing a Unified Lending Interface (ULI)—a transformative platform modeled after UPI—can potentially revolutionize the lending land.” “A comprehensive economic strategy pertaining to strengthening Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) will be key to this budget to financial inclusion and accelerate economic growth. We anticipate resource allocation dedicated towards expanding its applications beyond current applications to vital sectors like agriculture, healthcare and education. Additionally, to further enhance financial inclusion, targeted fiscal measures, such as subsidies or tax incentives, to stimulate innovation within the fintech and digital payment ecosystems is significant. This will enable all access to credit and other essential financial services, reaching even the country’s most remote corners.” Dabur India recorded its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 stood at ₹515.82 crore as against ₹506.44 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Shares traded at ₹530.95 on the NSE, up 2.48% “The US Federal Reserve has decided to maintain the overnight interest rates at their current range of 4.25% to 4.5% during its latest meeting on Wednesday. This decision aligns with the indications from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who previously suggested a stable interest rate environment while forecasting a potential cut of 25 basis points in December 2024. Consequently, the Fed’s stance reflects a cautious approach as it navigates ongoing economic uncertainties. Key factors influencing this decision include persistent inflation, which remains “somewhat elevated”, and an uncertain economic outlook. The Fed has emphasized that it is not in a hurry to implement further rate cuts, especially given the robust labour market conditions that have stabilised at low unemployment levels. Furthermore, the beginning of President Trump’s second term promises a slew of new policies and reforms which could upend or energise the political and economic incumbency. As such, the Fed is in the “wait and watch” mode before deciding on the next plan of action. Moreover, the Fed’s decision may have implications for foreign investments, particularly in markets like India. Investors typically anticipate that lower US interest rates would attract capital inflows into emerging markets; however, the current rate stability might exacerbate Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) selling trends observed in recent months in India.” Stocks advanced on BSE at 3.04 pm on January 30, 2025, were 2,066 against 1,835 stocks that declined, and 135 remained unchanged. Total stocks traded were 4,036. The number of stocks that recorded a 52-week high was 56, and those that hit a 52-week low was 93. A total of 224 stocks traded in the upper circuit, and 275 in the lower circuit. Coromandel International board has declared Interim Dividend of ₹6 per equity share, which will be paid on or after February 19, 2025. The Record Date fixed is February 5, 2025. The board has approved proposal establish a wholly owned subsidiary Company in Netherlands, Europe, with an investment value of up to EUR 1,00,000, and issuance of corporate guarantee for an amount of up to USD 11 million in favour of one or more banks for availing working capital facilities by Baobab Mining & Chemicals Corporation, Senegal, an associate Company. The company recorded its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 stood at ₹507.91 crore as against ₹228.11 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Shares gained 1.83% on the NSE to ₹1,825.60. “As we approach the Union Budget 2025, we are optimistic about its potential to catalyze growth and transformation in India’s agriculture sector. Contributing over 15% to the GDP and employing more than 45% of the population, agriculture has grown at an average annual rate of 4.18% over the past five years. We anticipate focused allocations toward driving technology adoption, enhancing productivity, and strengthening storage and supply chain infrastructure. These measures would not only empower farmers, the true ‘annadatas,’ but also benefit agricultural machinery owners and OEMs. At Crystal Crop, we continue to push the boundaries in crop protection, seeds, and Agri-equipment through innovative R&D across various segments like pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, natural crop solutions, seeds, and agri-equipment. We look forward to initiatives that further improve productivity per hectare while creating employment opportunities for India’s talented youth. Moreover, we fully align with the government’s vision for Aatmanirbhar Bharat in agriculture, embracing technology-driven solutions and championing policies that encourage gender diversity and inclusivity in the sector.” HeidelbergCement’s net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 stood at ₹5.19 crore as against ₹31.47 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year.

Guaranteed insurance plans combine the advantages of insurance and savings, offering long-term guaranteed returns ranging from 10/15 years to a whole life, a feature unique to these plans. Term insurance plans offer invaluable financial protection to families in the event of an untimely death—a benefit that no other financial instrument can provide. Unit-linked insurance plans not only combine insurance and savings but also provide market-linked returns. These benefits emphasize the comprehensive value that insurance products bring to financial planning.” Pokarna reported a consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹50.59 crore as against ₹44.95 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year.

With these developments, there is an opportunity for India to introduce progressive measures in the upcoming budget that can positively impact the industry, reinforcing India’s leadership in the global digital economy. We strongly believe that a balanced regulatory framework is key to unlocking the full potential of the VDA space in India. Such a framework should encourage innovation, promote transparency, and ensure robust investor protection. It is crucial that policymakers work closely with industry leaders to create regulations that are both forward-thinking and adaptable to the rapidly evolving nature of digital assets. Additionally, India has the opportunity to establish itself as a global hub for Web3 and blockchain adoption. By fostering an ecosystem that supports blockchain-based technologies, the country can attract global talent and investment, while also creating local job opportunities in emerging sectors. We also anticipate measures that will clarify taxation on VDA, encourage responsible investing, and support the mainstreaming of digital currencies. These steps will not only promote broader adoption but will also strengthen India’s position as a key player in the global VDA and blockchain landscape. At Binance, we remain committed to supporting these efforts and positioning India as a leader in the future of digital finance.” We recommend extending the coverage of credit guarantee schemes to short term, small ticket loans for informal MSMEs or MSMEs engaged in sectors other than manufacturing. Current credit guarantee schemes such as those offered by the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGSTME) are limited to long-term loans in manufacturing, which excludes 70% of the MSMEs engaged in trade and service sectors. Extending credit guarantees to short-tenure, small-ticket loans would enable access to formal credit to this segment, which in turn will help them expand their business and also expand the employment opportunities. “As the Hon’ble Union Finance Minister Shri Nirmala Sitharaman Ji has highlighted that 2025 will be a pivotal year for significant policy measures aimed at driving India’s economic growth, the year is being observed as the ‘Year of Reforms,’ reflecting the government’s commitment to implementing reforms that can strengthen the economy and create sustainable growth. We anticipate a key focus on enhancing military modernization and boosting Aatmanirbharta (self-reliance) in defence, a critical area for national security.” “As the nation continues to invest in its defence sector, there is anticipation for increased allocations for innovation and research to support advanced technologies, fostering a robust defence manufacturing ecosystem and new initiatives contributing to the sector.

Stock declined 3.50% on the NSE to ₹2,237.35 Attributed to Ms. Srishti Dhir, Founder at Hub and Oak (Industry Expert Advocates Tax Deductions to Boost Housing Demand Amid High Interest Rates) “2024 was an exciting year for the real estate sector, and we’re optimistic that 2025 will continue that momentum. As we approach the Union Budget 2025-26, there’s hope for meaningful reforms that address the industry’s challenges. We are expecting that the government would increase tax deductions for homebuyers and developers, especially for affordable housing, which could revive demand amidst high interest rates. For Commercial Real Estate, tax incentives for green and sustainable projects could attract global interest and fuel development. Further, infrastructure investments in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities will open up fresh opportunities. Ultimately, a budget that focuses on criteria like ease of doing, attracting both domestic and foreign investments will help create a more resilient and sustainable real estate ecosystem for all involved—developers, investors, and homebuyers.” Yash Miglani, Managing Director, Migsun: NITI Aayog’s projection of the Indian real estate sector achieving a $1 trillion market size by 2030 underscores its immense growth potential and long-term opportunities. To support this trajectory, the sector seeks government intervention to reduce input costs, particularly for materials like steel, cement, and fuel in the forthcoming budget. Additionally, a reduction in the GST rate on cement and targeted initiatives to promote affordable housing through enhanced tax incentives would provide much-needed impetus to the sector’s growth and affordability. Vishal Sabharwal, Head Sales, Orris Group, “ As a major contributor to India’s GDP, the real estate sector anticipates long-overdue recognition as an industry in the upcoming budget. The sector experienced strong growth in 2024, particularly in luxury housing, reinforcing confidence among affluent buyers. However, industry status and a single-window clearance system remain critical unmet demands for a long time. Addressing these would streamline approvals, accelerate growth, and enhance the sector’s economic contribution. Additionally, reducing input costs such as steel, cement, and fuel, would alleviate construction expenses. Introducing tax incentives for homebuyers and investors could further drive demand and capital inflow, ensuring sustained sectoral growth. These strategic measures would boost expansion across all real estate segments. “ Deepak Kapoor, Director, Gulshan Group, said, “Even though the real estate sector has performed well in the last few years, a large percentage of the population is not yet close to owning a home. As a result, the sector has tremendous future potential, which is dependent on the government and apart from continuing its thrust on economic and infrastructural development also needs new initiatives. To begin with, we would urge the government to combine home loan principal and interest deductions and raise the limit to 5 lakh. Additionally, reducing the holding period for long-term capital gains exemption to two years and enhancing the Section 54EC exemption to Rs 1 crore would be great moves. Expanding REIT’s migration benefits would also encourage growth and investment in the sector. Other initiatives we hope for are making more land banks available for real estate development and a reduction in GST on input materials.” Dr. PN Arora, CMD, Yashoda Super Speciality Hospitals, Kaushambi, said, “As one of India’s largest sectors, both in terms of revenue and employment, the healthcare sector has witnessed unprecedented growth. Ahead of the forthcoming budget, we expect the government to reduce input GST on healthcare services. Besides, recent reports highlight the significant discrepancy between premiums collected and claims paid by insurance companies underscoring the urgent need for reform in India’s healthcare sector. We expect the government to focus on the concern and take certain measures to bridge this gap. Further, increased funding for public health facilities, along with incentives for private-sector collaboration, can improve access to quality care. A focused approach toward enhancing infrastructure in underserved areas will ensure better healthcare outcomes for all citizens.” Ajendra Singh, Vice President, Sales and Marketing, Spectrum@metro, said, “The commercial real estate grew exponentially in 2024, and is expected to grow this year too. Ahead of Budget 2025, we expect the government to grant industry status to the sector and implement a single-window clearance system to streamline approvals. The expectations extend to decreasing the input costs, such as steel and cement, revising depreciation rates for commercial buildings that align with current market realities, and tax incentives for investments in green buildings and sustainable development projects. Mr. Manoj Gaur, President CREDAI NCR and CMD, Gaurs Group , says “In many ways, real estate mirrors the country’s economic progress. Therefore, we expect the government to infuse new vigour into India’s economic development. One of the major demands of the sector is the rationalisation of stamp duty, which has increased significantly in recent years and is causing a big financial burden on buyers. Further, a revision of the current deduction limit from 1.5 lakh to 5 lakh under section 80(c) to ease home ownership experience should also be considered. “The oil and gas sector has experienced considerable momentum in recent months, and sustaining this growth hinges on focused policymaking in the Union Budget 2025. First and foremost would be the passage of the Oilfield (Regulation and Development) Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha, which can mark a turning point for the industry. The proposed changes will expedite approvals, simplify arbitration processes, and particularly benefit unconventional hydrocarbons like shale and coalbed methane, improving not only investments but also enhance resource utilization. Collaboration between public and private players must also be a priority. Initiatives like OLAP, DSF, and PEC have demonstrated the benefits of partnership in unlocking India’s hydrocarbon reserves. Expanding these frameworks and incentivizing private participation will further boost domestic production and reduce import dependency. The recent collaboration between ONGC and BP in Mumbai High can serve as a blueprint for public-private synergies for technological innovation and enhanced production outputs going ahead. Another important aspect to consider is the need to rationalize gas pricing formulas to minimize price distortions faced by producers and consumers under the existing multi-pricing mechanisms. By adopting a more streamlined formula that aligns with previous frameworks linking gas prices to crude oil benchmarks, India can enhance accessibility to cleaner fuel. These moves would be even more effective if implemented alongside the long-pending inclusion of oil and gas in GST, particularly natural gas. Its implementation would simplify taxation, improve the fuel’s competitiveness, and foster greater adoption of natural gas as a cleaner energy source, in line with India’s energy transition goals. The industry would also benefit from capital allocations for expanding midstream infrastructure, including pipelines and gas terminals. India’s current pipeline network, at approximately 20,000 kilometers, falls short of meeting future demand. Expanding this network and modernizing fuel transport infrastructure are critical to de-bottlenecking supply chains and unlocking production potential in newly explored basins. “The sugar industry is optimistic that Budget 2025 will address key challenges and pave the way for sustainable growth. A critical area of focus is the long-overdue revision of the Minimum Selling Price (MSP) for sugar, which has remained stagnant at Rs 31 per kg since 2019. Rising production costs and the increasing Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane necessitate a revision to Rs 39.14 per kg. Such a move will not only stabilize the financial health of sugar mills but also ensure fair and consistent returns for farmers, creating a balanced and resilient ecosystem. Equally important is advancing India’s ethanol blending goals, as the country approaches the E20 target by 2025. Achieving this milestone requires a robust roadmap, including continued policy support, technological innovation, and infrastructure expansion. Meeting the 20% blending target by 2025 will require approximately 1,016 crore liters of ethanol, rising to 1,350 crore liters when accounting for other uses. To meet this demand, ethanol production capacity must reach 1,700 crore liters by 2025. Targeted subsidies of INR 35,000 crore to create an additional 770 crore liters of production capacity will play a pivotal role. A key expectation from the government is the approval of the anticipated ethanol pricing bill, proposing an INR 4-5 per litre price hike for the Ethanol Supply Year 2024-25. This increase is essential to incentivize ethanol producers and distilleries to enhance production in alignment with India’s blending targets. Linking ethanol pricing to the FRP of sugarcane through a formula-based mechanism could further ensure stability for all stakeholders in the value chain. Furthermore, to establish the roadmap beyond E20 targets, the government should focus on aligning blending targets with domestic feedstock availability and securing a steady supply chain, utilizing surplus FCI rice until maize production meets blending requirements. Additionally, it should prioritize the development of flex-fuel vehicles and expand dispensing infrastructure to support various ethanol-blended fuel options effectively. Investments in research and development are also crucial in ensuring India remains a global leader in biofuel innovation. Breakthroughs in 2G ethanol, Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), and ethanol-to-hydrogen conversion technologies will keep India at the cutting edge of the biofuel sector. In parallel, India’s commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2070 underscores the need for significant investment in renewable energy.” “The sugar industry is optimistic that Budget 2025 will address key challenges and pave the way for sustainable growth.

The upcoming Union Budget is an opportunity to remove financial barriers and encourage adoption. One key step would be restoring 100% accelerated depreciation for solar investments—a policy that once made solar a more viable choice but was later reduced to 40%. Bringing it back would help businesses recover costs faster and drive wider adoption. On the residential sector, the subsidy provided on systems could be replaced by income tax incentives which would remove the administrative burden of managing the subsidy mechanism. This could also get more people filing taxes. Equally important is strengthening domestic solar manufacturing. Providing better infra support and tax breaks would be better than production-linked incentives.” Joseph Sudheer Thumma, Global Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director, Magellanic Cloud: “In an era of rapid Gen AI, and cloud computing, we expect the government’s upcoming budget to prioritise policies that foster innovation and address the evolving needs of the tech sector. This includes continued support for R&D in cutting-edge technologies, initiatives to bridge the digital divide and enhance digital literacy, and a focus on developing a robust infrastructure to safeguard our digital assets. We believe these measures will be crucial for India to maintain its competitive edge in the global technology landscape.” Amit Chadha, CEO & Managing Director, L&T Technology Services and NASSCOM Executive Council member, L&T Technology Services: “India’s growth trajectory is at an exciting juncture, and we anticipate that the upcoming budget will play a crucial role in fostering technological advancements. The Government of India’s efforts to drive economic growth and promote innovation has been noteworthy. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme has been a significant step in boosting manufacturing capabilities and encouraging investment. At LTTS, we strongly believe that the government’s sustained emphasis on incentivising investments in R&D and creating a conducive ecosystem for technology-led advancements can unlock immense potential for engineering services firms. Such initiatives will not only strengthen India’s standing as a preferred destination for global ER&D but also catalyse economic growth by delivering value across sectors like manufacturing, energy, and mobility. We expect the budget to further accelerate India’s growth momentum by introducing policies that promote investments in research and development, digital transformation and advanced skill development. We are optimistic that the budget will introduce policies supporting innovation, sustainability, and growth, aligning with initiatives like the National Green Hydrogen Mission. This will likely foster a business-friendly environment, boosting investments in research and development, digital transformation, and skill development, ultimately driving India’s growth momentum forward.” Venkatraman Narayanan, Managing Director & CFO, Happiest Minds: “As we approach the Union Budget 2025, we hope for policy measures that accelerate India’s journey towards becoming a global digital innovation hub. All action taken to strengthen our domestic economy, more money into Capex, reduction of taxes on the individual tax payer thus putting money into his hands and eventually driving consumption, simplification of tax procedures, both direct and indirect, and reduction in the compliance burden would really put us back on the path of continued growth. Additionally, incentives and steps to strengthen our digital infrastructure, reskilling programs will not only prepare the workforce for the future but also ensure equitable growth.

Shares surged 4.23% on the NSE to ₹1,097.1 Rajiv Bhutani, Partner, Transfer Pricing, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India Compliance Maintenance of TP Documentation: Since the introduction of TP provisions in 2001, the threshold for maintaining TP documentation for taxpayers has been set at INR 1 crore in aggregate value of international transactions. However, as businesses expand and related-party transactions increase, this threshold appears outdated. The expectation is to raise the threshold for mandatory TP documentation at INR 10 crores, in line with the growing scale of multinational enterprises in India. Exemption of Non-Residents from TP Certification: Currently, non-resident taxpayers earning income from interest, dividends, royalties, or technical fees, do not need to file their income taxreturn in India, provided taxes have been appropriately deducted on said income by the taxpayer. However, these taxpayers are still required to mandatorily furnish a TP Certificate if such taxableincome is earned from parties in India. Given that these non-resident taxpayers are exempted from furnishing their income tax return subject to meeting the above stated conditions, it is recommended that such taxpayers should also be exempted from furnishing the TP certificate, aligning with the broader tax compliance simplification. Recalibration of the Arm’s Length Range: Under the existing TP regulations, India uses an arm’s length range between the 35 th and 65 th percentiles while determining arm’s length pricing. However, this range diverges from internationally accepted standards. To align India’s regulations with global norms, the expectation is to revise the range to an interquartile range, spanning from 25 th percentile to the 75 th percentile, which better reflects the true variability in arm’s length pricing. Dispute Management and Resolution Expedited Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) Process: The APA regime has been a powerful tool for Indian taxpayers looking to mitigate related-party transaction disputes and achieve certainty on their arm’s length pricing. While the APA program has been successful as compared to traditional dispute resolution routes delays in processing APA applications have resulted in a significant backlog. To enhance efficiency, we recommend streamlining the APA process by categorising applications based on their complexity. Complex cases could be allocated to more experienced teams, while simpler cases should be subject to shorter timelines for resolution. This bifurcation would enable faster conclusions, benefitting both the tax authorities and taxpayers. Expansion and Re-evaluation of Safe Harbour Provisions: Plenty of small taxpayers have opted for the Safe Harbour regime in order to conclude their arm’s length pricing in a streamlined manner. However, the applicable benchmarks are typically higher in this regime as compared to available alternatives. While the small taxpayers do get to enjoy this benefit of convenience, the threshold restrictions in the Safe Harbour regime makes it inaccessible to the taxpayers with comparatively higher value of transactions, forcing them into complex dispute resolution processes. To make this regime more accessible, the Government may re-evaluate the Safe Harbour provisions by (a) increasing the transaction thresholds to cover a larger number of companies, and (b) adjusting the rates to be closer to actual comparable benchmarks, thereby encouraging broader adoption andreducing litigation risks.” ----- Deepashree Shetty, Partner, Global Employer Services, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India “The Budget announced in July 2024 brought limited changes for individual taxpayers, leaving many to hope that the upcoming Budget 2025 will deliver the much-needed tax relief to alleviate their financial pressures. There is a strong expectation that the government will focus on improving taxpayers’ savings by introducing reforms such as a unified tax regime and enhanced deductions. The Dilemma of Old vs New Tax Regimes - The introduction of two tax regimes - Old Tax Regime (OTR) and New Tax Regime (NTR) - was intended to offer taxpayers flexibility, allowing them to choose the system that best suits their investments, savings habits, and preferences. However, the reality has been far more complex. Many taxpayers find themselves confused between the two regimes, often reassessing their choice not only during the year but also while filing their tax returns. In light of these complexities, the upcoming Budget should focus on simplifying the tax structure for individual taxpayers by consolidating the current dual regimes into a single, cohesive tax framework. While this shift may take time, it is anticipated that the OTR may eventually be phased out, with its abolition ideally scheduled for FY 2026-27 to provide ample time for taxpayers, employers, and financial institutions to adjust. A Single, More Beneficial Tax Regime - Since the introduction of the NTR, the options for tax savings have been limited, making it essential to reconsider and amend the structure for the benefit of taxpayers. While the NTR is preferred as a streamlined tax system, it can be made even more effective by incorporating the following key changes: Simplification of income tax slabs and rates: Increasing the basic exemption limit of income from INR 3 lakhs to INR 5 lakhs The differences between tax slabs are currently inconsistent at INR 2 lakhs or INR 3 lakhs. A more uniform approach is needed with consistent income gaps. Introducing a new 25% tax rate slab will provide further tax relief for middle-income earners. The tax rates currently stand at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%. The income limit for the 30% should be enhanced from INR 15 lakhs to INR 20 lakhs. Inclusion of popular deductions under the NTR: Section 80C: Allow deductions up to INR 2 lakhs for life insurance premiums, employees’ Provident Fund contributions, etc. Section 80D: Extend the deduction up to INR 1 lakh for health insurance premiums for self and family, addressing the growing burden of medical expenses. Section 80TTB: Include a deduction of up to INR 50,000 for senior citizens earning interest from deposits with banks, post offices, etc. 10(13A): Allow salaried taxpayers to claim HRA deductions for rental expenditure under the NTR. These proposed amendments will make the NTR not only simpler but also more tax-efficient” ----- Santhosh Sivaraj, Partner, Global Employer Services, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India Standard Deduction Limit - “With the well-awaited Budget 2025, the salaried individuals would be expecting some relief to the tax costs they bear on the salary income. With the introduction of the New Tax Regime in recent years, in the 2024 budget, the Hon’ble Finance Minister (FM) announced the allowability of an increased standard deduction of INR 75,000 per annum for those who opt for New Tax Regime as against INR 50,000 per annum who opt for Old Tax Regime. Standard deduction was abolished in the Financial Year (FY) 2005-06 and Late Hon’ble FM, Arun Jaitley reintroduced standard deduction in the 2018 budget. As per the 2018 budget speech, the Late Hon’ble FM mentioned “To provide relief to salaried taxpayers, I propose to allow a standard deduction of INR `40,000/- instead of the present exemption regarding transport allowance and reimbursement of miscellaneous medical expenses....Apart from reducing paperwork and compliance, this will help middle-class employees even more in reducing their tax liability...” While in Financial Year 2018-19, there were no two separate tax regimes, INR 40,000 was reintroduced as a standard deduction towards transport allowance and miscellaneous medical expenses. Owing to the inflation and increase in prices in both transport and medical since FY 2018-19 since the time standard deduction was reintroduced, the Hon’ble FM should look at bringing in parity for those opting for either the Old or the New Tax Regime and increase the standard deduction to a minimum of INR 1.20 lakhs a year. This would seem practical as any salaried taxpayer would be incurring INR 10,000 a month / INR 1.20 lakhs a year collectively towards transport and medical expenses.” ---- Kunal Gala, Partner, Deal Value Creation, BDO India “Digital infrastructure is likely to be a top priority in the Union Budget 2025, with continued investments being expected in projects like BharatNet to connect more than 6 lakh villages with high-speed broadband. Investments will also focus on expanding the 5G coverage which will be essential to enable the advancements in IoT, telemedicine, and smart city solutions. These will contribute to India’s digital transformation and bridge the rural-urban divide. To bolster this effort, subsidies for establishing data centers critical for cloud computing and AI-driven applications may be introduced which could attract global technology investments. It will also be crucial to implement robust cybersecurity frameworks and to ensure compliance with the Data Protection Bill to protect digital assets as India’s digital economy becomes more and more critical to its GDP growth” Kunal Gala, Partner, Deal Value Creation, BDO India “The Union Budget for the year FY26 is likely to face the double challenge of boosting up the economic growth and achieving fiscal consolidation. The GDP growth rate reduced to 5.4% in the second quarter of the financial year 2024-25 (against RBI projection of 6.8%) and the government has a fiscal deficit target of less than 4.5% of the GDP for the fiscal year 2025-26, so the spending priorities will have to be set properly. Corporate tax rates are not likely to be increased as India is looking to attract foreign capital, especially for large-scale projects. Investors remain cautious as Indian government bonds offer only ~ 2% higher yield than U.S. Treasury notes, reflecting limited risk-adjusted returns. Delaying the fiscal deficit target by a year to put more money into infrastructure and to satisfy the middle class could be a reasonable approach to turn around the economic growth and to create jobs.” Kunal Gala, Partner, Deal Value Creation, BDO India “With as few as 7% of the population i.e. about 75 million people, filing returns last year and 63% of return-filing individuals paying no tax, there is a systemic problem concerning compliance and income disclosure. Since a small group of high earners are responsible for most of the taxes, there is the need for reforms that not only simplify the tax code but also expand its base. The government is probably going to concentrate on making the system more inclusive and efficient, covering more of the population. Middle-class concerns such as compliance measures, tax complexity, and public services are critical to addressing the measures that need to be taken to keep a large population benefitted. A balanced approach is necessary to ensure sustainable revenue growth and reduce reliance on indirect taxes, which disproportionately impact lower-income groups.” ---- Aakash Uppal, Partner & Leader (North & East), Corporate Tax, Tax and Regulatory Services, BDO India Personal Income Tax: Under the existing tax regime, individuals with annual earnings up to INR 5 lakhs are exempt from paying taxes, while the new tax regime raises this threshold to INR 7 lakhs, aiming to provide more relief to taxpayers. The Government is expected to further enhance the new tax regime by increasing the basic exemption limit, adjusting tax slabs, and raising the standard deduction. Additionally, there is speculation that the Government may introduce a sunset clause for the old tax regime, gradually phasing it out in favor of the new system. These measures would make the new tax regime more taxpayer-friendly, encourage savings and investments, and support economic growth. Concessional Tax Rate for Manufacturing Companies: In 2019, a concessional tax rate of 15% was announced for new manufacturing companies that began production on or before 31 March 2024. However, this relief was not extended by the Finance Act (No. 2), 2024. Currently, a tax rate of 25.17% (including surcharge and cess) is applicable for companies that could not benefit from the earlier concessional tax regime for manufacturing companies. The DTC may reintroduce this concessional tax rate to further support the government’s Make-in-India initiative, maintaining India’s appeal as a destination for new manufacturing investments. While the Production Linked Incentive offers some relief, an additional tax incentive would further bolster the sector’s growth. Capital Gains Income: The DTC has simplified the categorization of assets for capital gains purposes, consolidating multiple holding periods into a single 24-month period, except for listed shares.. However, the holding period for new assets under section 54 of the Act remains at three years, which could be rationalized and brought down to 24 months. Moreover, there is a strong industry expectation that the exemption limit for Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) on equities, currently set at INR 1.25 lakh, may be increased to INR 2 lakh or higher, which would allow investors to retain a greater portion of their returns. Aakash Uppal, Partner & Leader (North & East), Corporate Tax, Tax and Regulatory Services, BDO India BEPS: Pillar Two: India is among the 140 countries that have signed on to the OECD’s Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules on Pillar Two. These rules are designed to prevent multinational groups from exploiting tax arbitrage by ensuring that they pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in every jurisdiction where they operate. Currently, around 30 countries which have implemented Pillar Two Rules in 2024, with another 30-35 countries expected to follow suit in 2025. While India has committed to the Pillar Two framework, it has taken a cautious approach by not incorporating it in previous budgets. Therefore, it will be crucial for the Government to clarify the application of Pillar Two in DTC and outline the reporting requirements in the upcoming Union Budget. Simplification of Tax Filing and Reduction in Litigation Timeline: Filing tax returns for non-salaried taxpayers has become increasingly cumbersome due to the extensive information required in the forms. There is a strong need within the DTC to streamline these forms by simplifying the language and rationalizing the information requests. Additionally, under the Faceless Assessment Scheme, taxpayers face operational challenges such as the lack of grievance filing options, no provision for rectifications, and limited opportunities for early hearings with faceless Commissioners of Income Tax. These inefficiencies lead to protracted litigation and significant amounts of tax revenue being locked in disputes. The DTC should address these issues by introducing an operational framework to improve the functioning of the Faceless Assessment Scheme, thereby reducing the backlog of pending appeals. Other Key Amendments: The DTC is also expected to bring about several other important changes. These include shifting to a calendar year for tax purposes instead of the financial year, simplifying the residential status for individuals by removing complex categories like ‘Resident but not Ordinary Resident’, introducing unified tax rates for domestic and foreign companies, and expanding the tax base for withholding taxes. Additionally, further rationalizing of withholding tax rates and provisions is anticipated. Rajiv Bhutani, Partner, Transfer Pricing, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India Compliance Maintenance of TP Documentation: Since the introduction of TP provisions in 2001, the threshold for maintaining TP documentation for taxpayers has been set at INR 1 crore in aggregate value of international transactions. However, as businesses expand and related-party transactions increase, this threshold appears outdated. The expectation is to raise the threshold for mandatory TP documentation at INR 10 crores, in line with the growing scale of multinational enterprises in India. Exemption of Non-Residents from TP Certification: Currently, non-resident taxpayers earning income from interest, dividends, royalties, or technical fees, do not need to file their income taxreturn in India, provided taxes have been appropriately deducted on said income by the taxpayer. However, these taxpayers are still required to mandatorily furnish a TP Certificate if such taxableincome is earned from parties in India. Given that these non-resident taxpayers are exempted from furnishing their income tax return subject to meeting the above stated conditions, it is recommended that such taxpayers should also be exempted from furnishing the TP certificate, aligning with the broader tax compliance simplification. Recalibration of the Arm’s Length Range: Under the existing TP regulations, India uses an arm’s length range between the 35 th and 65 th percentiles while determining arm’s length pricing. However, this range diverges from internationally accepted standards. To align India’s regulations with global norms, the expectation is to revise the range to an interquartile range, spanning from 25 th percentile to the 75 th percentile, which better reflects the true variability in arm’s length pricing. Dispute Management and Resolution Expedited Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) Process: The APA regime has been a powerful tool for Indian taxpayers looking to mitigate related-party transaction disputes and achieve certainty on their arm’s length pricing. While the APA program has been successful as compared to traditional dispute resolution routes delays in processing APA applications have resulted in a significant backlog. To enhance efficiency, we recommend streamlining the APA process by categorising applications based on their complexity. Complex cases could be allocated to more experienced teams, while simpler cases should be subject to shorter timelines for resolution. This bifurcation would enable faster conclusions, benefitting both the tax authorities and taxpayers. Expansion and Re-evaluation of Safe Harbour Provisions: Plenty of small taxpayers have opted for the Safe Harbour regime in order to conclude their arm’s length pricing in a streamlined manner. However, the applicable benchmarks are typically higher in this regime as compared to available alternatives. While the small taxpayers do get to enjoy this benefit of convenience, the threshold restrictions in the Safe Harbour regime makes it inaccessible to the taxpayers with comparatively higher value of transactions, forcing them into complex dispute resolution processes. To make this regime more accessible, the Government may re-evaluate the Safe Harbour provisions by (a) increasing the transaction thresholds to cover a larger number of companies, and (b) adjusting the rates to be closer to actual comparable benchmarks, thereby encouraging broader adoption andreducing litigation risks.” ----- Deepashree Shetty, Partner, Global Employer Services, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India “The Budget announced in July 2024 brought limited changes for individual taxpayers, leaving many to hope that the upcoming Budget 2025 will deliver the much-needed tax relief to alleviate their financial pressures. There is a strong expectation that the government will focus on improving taxpayers’ savings by introducing reforms such as a unified tax regime and enhanced deductions. The Dilemma of Old vs New Tax Regimes - The introduction of two tax regimes - Old Tax Regime (OTR) and New Tax Regime (NTR) - was intended to offer taxpayers flexibility, allowing them to choose the system that best suits their investments, savings habits, and preferences. However, the reality has been far more complex. Many taxpayers find themselves confused between the two regimes, often reassessing their choice not only during the year but also while filing their tax returns. In light of these complexities, the upcoming Budget should focus on simplifying the tax structure for individual taxpayers by consolidating the current dual regimes into a single, cohesive tax framework. While this shift may take time, it is anticipated that the OTR may eventually be phased out, with its abolition ideally scheduled for FY 2026-27 to provide ample time for taxpayers, employers, and financial institutions to adjust. A Single, More Beneficial Tax Regime - Since the introduction of the NTR, the options for tax savings have been limited, making it essential to reconsider and amend the structure for the benefit of taxpayers. While the NTR is preferred as a streamlined tax system, it can be made even more effective by incorporating the following key changes: Simplification of income tax slabs and rates: Increasing the basic exemption limit of income from INR 3 lakhs to INR 5 lakhs The differences between tax slabs are currently inconsistent at INR 2 lakhs or INR 3 lakhs. A more uniform approach is needed with consistent income gaps. Introducing a new 25% tax rate slab will provide further tax relief for middle-income earners. The tax rates currently stand at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%. The income limit for the 30% should be enhanced from INR 15 lakhs to INR 20 lakhs. Inclusion of popular deductions under the NTR: Section 80C: Allow deductions up to INR 2 lakhs for life insurance premiums, employees’ Provident Fund contributions, etc. Section 80D: Extend the deduction up to INR 1 lakh for health insurance premiums for self and family, addressing the growing burden of medical expenses. Section 80TTB: Include a deduction of up to INR 50,000 for senior citizens earning interest from deposits with banks, post offices, etc. 10(13A): Allow salaried taxpayers to claim HRA deductions for rental expenditure under the NTR. These proposed amendments will make the NTR not only simpler but also more tax-efficient” ----- Santhosh Sivaraj, Partner, Global Employer Services, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India Standard Deduction Limit - “With the well-awaited Budget 2025, the salaried individuals would be expecting some relief to the tax costs they bear on the salary income.

Additionally, further rationalizing of withholding tax rates and provisions is anticipated. India is the only country where a Union Government Budget garners so much attention, unlike any of its global counterparts. Businesses and the communities set high expectations either on tax cuts or higher budgetary allocations just prior to the budget presentation. For the government, it is a balancing act with the current economic priorities and the need for fiscal discipline. Income Tax Slabs and Rates We would expect some steps to enhance the disposable income of the salaried taxpayers by realigning and reducing the existing income tax slabs. The mid-income urban population has seen limited inflation adjusted income growth in the post Covid period which has impacted discretionary purchases – higher tax savings can lead to stronger urban consumption demand.This can also strengthen demand for more affordable housing projects in the urban areas. In the earlier budget, the Government had brought out schemes to incentivize employment by the private sector – further measures may be taken in the current budget to ensure that such employment generation witnesses an acceleration. Personal Taxation The upcoming budget holds promise for low- and middle-income earners with a likelihood of some tax savings. To give a boost to the urban economy and consumption, the post-tax incomes of the salaried class need to see some material uplift. The Government may consider lower tax rates or some other kind of relief for those in the income category between Rs 7 lakh and Rs 15 lakh. In a continued attempt to shift more people towards the New Tax Regime, the tax rate relief may be provided only in the latter. Simplifying taxes on pension products (including those under NPS) is expected to encourage more people to invest in retirement planning.Given the steadily increasing premiums on health insurance, there is an expectation that there will be an increase in the deduction limits under Section 80D. Such a step will also help to enhance the penetration of health insurance and coverage in the country. Overall, we expect the government to take new measures to further simplify the direct income tax laws and improve the level of compliance. Taxation on emerging assets In Budget 2024, the PM-E drive was introduced, aiming to reduce the sector’s dependency on subsidies. However, the EV industry continues to face challenges such as infrastructure limitations and high adoption costs. In the upcoming Union Budget, the focus could shift to performance-linked incentives for battery and related auto-component production. Also, push for GST parity on EV spare parts, essential components to be taxed at the same rate as other automotive parts (EV spare parts, currently under unlisted goods, are taxed at 28%, while the other automotive spare parts are taxed at 18% GST rate). This move will help give the EVs a more competitive edge as they are still looking to be cost competitive in the automobile industry. Private Sector Investments We expect the Union Budget 2025 to especially focus on the manufacturing sector, with the sector posting a meagre growth of only 2.7% YoY in Q2 FY2025. As geo-political dynamics change and the US imposes higher tariffs on goods from China, there is clearly a great opportunity for India to capitalize, in part if not full, the demand for manufactured goods in US and other developed economies. Timely investments by the private sector is critical for that perspective. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Policies and Gati Shakti Master Plan are already in place and have got partial traction. The FDI inflows in India have risen from $45.1 billion in 2014-15 to $70.9 billion in 2023-24, reflecting a steady rise in foreign investors’ confidence in establishing operations within the country. Agricultural Sector The upcoming Budget will likely honour its commitment by substantially increasing agricultural R&D allocations, targeting an uplift from under 0.5% to at least 1% of agricultural GDP. Additionally, fertilizer reforms are anticipated as the government focuses on enhancing domestic production, particularly of nano-liquid urea, to stabilize prices and reduce import dependency. The Budget is also expected to promote natural farming, self-sufficiency in pulses, shrimp production, and vegetable clusters to boost productivity and meet changing consumer demands. Moreover, a significant emphasis is likely to be placed on promoting biofuels and ethanol to support sustainable farming practices. Budget 2025 will likely expand schemes such as “AgriStack”, which include digitalization across all sectors, along with its flagship scheme KCC. This would also streamline processes and eliminate existing trade barriers to ensure fair pricing for farmers. The budget is likely to focus on agriculture infrastructure, with an emphasis on higher yields, agriculture cluster development, cold storage, warehousing, and supply chain improvements to reduce post-harvest losses and enhance market access, alongside measures for water management, climate change mitigation, and investments in technologies like solar pumps, drones, and precision farming to drive efficiency and innovation. Fiscal Consolidation On the fiscal consolidation front, the Union Budget is expected to reiterate its commitment to maintain fiscal discipline while balancing growth. The Indian government is well on its way to reduce its fiscal deficit to 4.9% of GDP (which stood at Rs 8.47 Lakh Cr as of April-Nov) in the current financial year, down from 5.6% in FY24. The government is expected to stay on track to reduce the fiscal deficit further to 4.5% of GDP for FY26 and may even aim for further improvements. With uncertainties around the extent of GDP growth in FY26 and the need for a capex push, a greater focus on asset monetization is anticipated to bridge fiscal gaps and support sustainable growth. Revenue mobilization is likely to play a significant role in achieving this goal. Efforts to improve tax compliance (with more rebates and concessions as well as simplifying the new tax regime) are already expected. Reforms in GST, specifically simplification of the process, will help enhance the collections. “For the housing finance sector, the upcoming budget should focus on reviewing and modifying important regulations that take into account the current state of the housing market, which is essential for making homeownership genuinely affordable. With property prices having risen in recent years, the current GST concession limit for affordable housing, which is set at ₹45 lakh, should be revised to ₹60-65 lakh. Similarly, the RBI’s priority sector definition for housing loans should be updated to reflect this new limit. Given the inflation over the past decade, the definitions for EWS (Economically Weaker Sections) and LIG (Lower Income Groups) also need to be updated. An upward revision from ₹3 lakh to ₹5 lakh for EWS and from ₹6 lakh to ₹9 lakh for LIG will create new demand and broaden the target groups that fall within these classifications. The existing ₹2 lakh income tax deduction for housing loan interest should be increased to ₹4 lakh. Additionally, to support first-time homeowners during the waiting period for possession, this refund should apply to residences that are still under construction, for a maximum of two years. Finally, the notional rent tax on second homes should be exempted when the property is purchased or constructed at a parental place, remains vacant, and does not generate rental income. Furthermore, increasing the corpus for affordable housing funds will ensure refinancing to Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) at concessional rates, helping to expand affordable housing availability across the country.” Second Rating Upgrade in Three Months for SpiceJet GURUGRAM, January 30, 2025: SpiceJet has been assigned a BB-; Stable credit rating by CareEdge Ratings, marking its second upgrade in just three months. The improved rating highlights the airline’s steady financial recovery and progress in executing its turnaround plan. SpiceJet’s liquidity remains adequate, bolstered by recent fundraises and an expected additional INR 676 crore from outstanding share warrants over the short-to-medium term. With recent fund issuances, the company has been slowly increasing its operating fleet, the rating agency said. “The company’s liquidity is currently characterised as adequate considering its cash & cash equivalent derived from preferential issuances and QIP issuance in the last 18 months. The company has raised INR 3878 crore which has been used to largely clear its statutory dues, settlement with creditors, settling of external commercial borrowings, ungrounding of fleet and new induction, servicing debt obligations, among others,” Care Ratings said. “We are delighted with the rating upgrade, which is a testament to our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our operational efficiency,” said Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director, SpiceJet. “The funds we have raised, coupled with our focus on ungrounding aircraft and optimising our fleet, will ensure a strong turnaround for the airline. With a firm plan in place, we are confident in delivering sustainable growth, financial stability, and enhanced value to all stakeholders.” The ratings agency has also recognized SpiceJet’s consistent track record as one of the most efficient utilisers of its operating fleet, with the highest passenger load factor (PLF) in the industry for the last four fiscal years through FY24. The rating agency expects this trend to continue, which is key to sustainable profitable operations. “The pharmaceutical sector is the cornerstone of India’s healthcare and economic growth. The Union Budget should focus on R&D, innovation, incentivizing domestic manufacturing and exports to strengthen India’s self-reliance and global leadership. MSMEs in pharma need credit access, tax benefits, and reduced regulatory burdens to scale operations and drive employment. GST rationalization on essential medicines, coupled with simplified compliance, will make healthcare more affordable. Expanding healthcare accessibility through public-private partnerships, digital health, and infrastructure investments is key to achieving universal healthcare.

Given that the revenue generation would have significantly increased with STT, this can potentially be used to revert the LTCG to 10% in order to ensure even higher market participation and incentivise long-term investment which is critical for the users and the capital market stability. This can also address reduction in the flight of capital from India towards global markets and potentially contribute to rupee appreciation as well.” The automotive sector in India is at the cusp of a massive transformation in terms of technology, self-reliance and a sustainable future. Continental is both optimistic and hopeful that the Union Budget 2025 will lay the groundwork for a more effective, advanced, and environmentally accountable automotive ecosystem. Key Expectations A simplified classification and GST rate structure for automobiles and auto components. One of the most significant issues in the auto sector is the complexity and inconsistency in the classification of auto parts, components and finished vehicles under the HSN codes. A simplified nomenclature will further facilitate the ease of doing business. It would help in eliminating confusion and improve compliance, thereby reducing unnecessary litigation around classification. Reduction of GST on hybrid vehicles With the growing demand for greener, emission-friendly powertrains among customers, sustained focus on green mobility with cuts in GST for hybrid technologies is key. Hybrid vehicles in India are currently burdened with the highest rate of tax of 28%, making them less attractive than fully electric or conventional petrol/diesel vehicles. Hybrid Technology is considered a bridging tech, before we effectively move to EVs. This is additionally helpful while EV charging infrastructure develops. Incentives to promote R&D, innovation in Automotive electronics and encouraging start-ups. Incentives to promote R&D and innovation in capital-intensive Automotive electronics hardware sector. Government could consider additional income tax reduction for Indian corporates spending over 3 per cent of their turnover to advance R&D and filing patents/designs in India. Well-calibrated incentive system designed to empower industry players could motivate companies to invest in the R&D value chain in cutting-edge technology domains like AI, IoT, and embedded technologies in automotive electronics sector. We also need to support start-ups in this space. These steps will guarantee that India stays competitive in the global automotive landscape. Overall policy landscape A strong focus on aligning policies to improve the manufacturing capability while also taking care of the existing challenges to catalyze growth in this sector - like correcting the inverted duty structures in automotive, tax benefits for EV investments, more allocation in PLI schemes for automotive, more investments in charging infrastructure. In addition to promoting domestic manufacturing this will also aid FDI inflow. To accelerate India’s journey towards becoming a global hub for automotive technology, we must have a conducive policy environment while addressing pressing sustainability challenges and elevating road safety standards. We are eager to support the Indian government in this shared vision for mobility. Together, we can create a safer, more efficient, and environmentally responsible future of mobility.” Hitachi Energy stock zoomed 20% to trade at its upper circuit on the NSE at ₹12,277.50 following Q3 results. Its profit after tax (PAT) rallied to ₹137.4 crore for the December quarter 2024, as against ₹23 crore in the October-December period of the preceding 2023-24 fiscal. “The gold industry contributes 1.3% to India’s GDP and employs approximately 2-3 million people. The government’s decision last July to reduce import duties on gold has significantly had a positive impact on the gold industry. It has reduced unofficial imports, stabilised official channels, and encouraged domestic purchasing of gold. The reduction in taxes on gold has led to a more organised and transparent industry, resulting in a stronger gold market. Any increase in import duties in upcoming budget may have adverse effects, potentially leading to an increase in smuggling, higher domestic gold prices, and pushing the industry backwards. It is imperative that stakeholders, including government bodies, industry players, and financial institutions, collaborate to sustain this positive momentum. By fostering a synergetic environment, we can ensure that the gold industry continues to thrive, innovate and contribute significantly to the India’s economic development and prosperity. Similar to last decade, we are expecting progressive, people friendly and industry supportive policy announcements.” Nifty Bank index is gathering strength.

The agriculture sector, which employs nearly 50% of India’s workforce, requires significant investment to enhance productivity, efficiency, and sustainability. We expect the budget to allocate substantial funds for: - Improving irrigation infrastructure to reduce dependence on monsoon rains - Promoting organic and natural farming practices to enhance soil health and reduce chemical usage - Supporting livestock development, particularly indigenous breeds, to augment rural incomes - Enhancing farmers’ access to markets, credit, and technology - We wanted to bring to your attention the critical issue regarding the improvement of Indian cow breeds. One of the major hurdles we face is the lack of a DNA data bank. Establishing DNA testing labs that are accessible and affordable for our farmers is essential. This would not only strengthen the DNA data bank but also facilitate scientific advancements in cow breeding. - We believe that Indian breeders have the potential to achieve significant financial success similar to that of Brazilian farmers. There is a growing demand for the semen and embryos of Indian cows and bulls across Latin America, and if the government resumes exports, our farmers could tap into the international market. This opportunity could enable them to command better prices for their products. - We pleased to share that the The International Federation of Indigenous Zebu Cattle Of India (IFIZCI) has recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Brazil’s largest institution ABCZ, which has been dedicated to scientifically improving Zebu cattle for the past 90 years. This collaboration aims to significantly enhance the quality of Zebu breeds such as Gir, Kankrej, Red Sindhi, and Ongole across Brazil. We are excited about partnering with this esteemed organization to maintain a Zebu herdbook in India, which we believe is crucial for both small and large farmers. By tracking and improving the quality of indigenous cattle, this initiative can bring monumental changes to the farming community. We encourage the Government of India to take necessary steps to support indigenous herdbook initiative, as it has the potential to revolutionize the cattle farming sector nationally. By prioritizing these areas, the Government can help Indian agriculture become more resilient, productive, and profitable. We look forward to a budget that addresses the pressing needs of India’s farmers and rural communities.” Crude oil futures remained steady on Thursday morning as official data showed an increase in inventories in the US for the week ending January 24.

The FOMC commentary was marginally hawkish by deleting the following from the Dec 24 FOMC statement - “inflation is making progress towards 2% objective “ and does not give any indication of any further rate cuts in the near term. FOMC would continue to be data dependent. Views of Mr. Jigar Trivedi, senior analyst at Reliance Securities. Fed held rates steady as widely expected The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left target range for federal funds rate unchanged at 4.25-4.5 percent.

Read more FOMC: Wait-and-watch mode on, says Madhavi Arora, Chief Economist, Emkay Global Financial Services ■ The Fed expectedly opted to remain on hold with no change in guidance language. No changes were announced regarding balance sheet policy, implying QT may continue through until at least 3Q CY25. ■ Markets initially viewed the statement as hawkish given Fed comments that inflation was still elevated while also removing language about seeing progress. ■ However, Powell titled dovish in the presser, stating that this was just a cleaning up of language and was not meant to send a message. Still, Powell characterized risks as balanced and, while still seeing policy as restrictive, stressed the FOMC is in no hurry to lower rates further. ■ Powell reiterated that if inflation stays firm rather than gradually easing as the Committee anticipates, they could keep policy on hold at current levels for longer. Conversely, if the labor market shows signs of unwanted weakening, they could ease rates further. ■ The initial market reaction was a cross-asset selloff, but assets mostly pared losses after a relatively dovish presser. March OIS Fed pricing rose just about ~3bp d/d, while two cuts are still being priced for the year. ■ Our baseline is for the Fed to remain on hold for upcoming meetings, before normalizing policy mildly somewhat further around later in the year. But we do not rule out no cuts either. However, we reckon there is somewhat a political angle to this. EM breathing space continues: ✓ With Fed’s action largely in price, elsewhere across the DM there has been easing. We are also seeing some key EMs cutting or on their way to cutting rates. FX and rates markets remain calm, giving wiggle rooms to EMs. ✓ We maintain, with the RBI now turning more judicious on its INR defense, we think the policy trilemma could tilt more toward letting the INR find its equilibrium to some extent, and provide some policy flexibility to the RBI on rate settings in general. ✓ This opens up space for Feb’25 repo cut, with more liquidity measures still needed after the recent announcement of Rs1.5tn worth of liquidity infusion Brigade: Net profit at Rs 236.2 cr vs Rs 73.5 cr, Revenue at Rs 1,463.9 cr vs Rs 1,173.8 cr (YoY) (Positive) Chalet: Net profit at Rs 96.5 cr vs Rs 70.6 cr, Revenue at Rs 457.8 cr vs Rs 373.7 cr (YoY) (Positive) Gabriel: Net profit at Rs 60 cr vs Rs 41 cr, Revenue at Rs. 1016 cr vs Rs 815 cr (YoY) (Positive) Suditi Ind: Net profit at Rs 1.3 cr vs loss Rs 1.8 cr, Revenue at Rs. 22 cr vs Rs 15 cr (YoY) (Positive) Ramratna Wire: Net profit at Rs 18.3 cr vs Rs 11.7 cr, Revenue at Rs. 888 cr vs Rs 698 cr (YoY) (Positive) Hitachi Energy: Net profit at Rs 137 cr vs Rs 52 cr, Revenue at Rs. 1620 cr vs Rs 1554 cr (YoY) (Positive) Samhi Hotel: Net profit at Rs 22.7 cr vs loss of Rs 236.4 cr, Revenue at Rs 295.7 cr vs Rs 267.8 cr (YoY) (Positive) CAMS: Net profit at Rs 124 cr vs Rs 89 cr, Revenue at Rs. 370 cr vs Rs 290 cr (YoY) (Positive) Tamiland Mercantile: Net profit at Rs 302. cr vs Rs 284.2 cr, NII at Rs. 570.4 cr vs Rs 537 cr (YoY) (Positive) Ask Automotive: Net profit at Rs 65.9 cr vs Rs 49.9 cr, Revenue at Rs. 915 cr vs Rs 761.7 cr (YoY) (Positive) Blue Star: Net profit at Rs 132.5 cr vs Rs 100.5 cr, Revenue at Rs. 2807 cr vs Rs 2241 cr (YoY) (Positive) Arvind Smart: Net profit at Rs 50 cr vs Rs 12 cr, Revenue at Rs. 210 cr vs Rs 84 cr (YoY) (Positive) SRF: Net profit at Rs 271.0 crore versus poll of Rs 239.0 crore, Revenue at Rs 3491 crore versus poll of Rs 3387 crore (Positive) Allied blenders: Net profit at Rs 57.5 cr vs loss Rs 4.4 cr, Revenue at Rs. 974 cr, up 8.8 percent (YoY) (Positive) Suditi Ind: Net profit at Rs 1.3 cr vs loss Rs 1.8 cr, Revenue at Rs. 22 cr vs Rs 15 cr (YoY) (Positive) Raymond: Net profit at Rs 72.3 crore versus Rs 41.3 crore, Revenue at Rs 954 crore versus Rs 678 crore (Positive) Sona BLW: Company signs MoU with the ePlane company to develop powertrain for eVTOLs and drones (Positive) GRSE/Apollo Micro: Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Apollo Micro Signed MoU for Joint Development and Supply of Advanced Weapons and Electronic Systems.

A key expectation is raising standard deduction limit in income tax, which would provide essential relief to middle-class families and boost disposable income, encouraging greater economic participation. Also, to foster an inclusive investment ecosystem, I hope the government evaluates increasing the long-term capital gains (LTCG) exemption limit to ₹5 lakh and reducing the Securities Transaction Tax (STT). Additionally, expanding capital gains exemptions under Sections 54 and 54F for residential property reinvestment would truly support India’s vision of a robust financial market. For Startups, simplifying ROC Compliance and keeping most of the sectors under Automatic FDI route will ensure brining in more capital into the ecosystem. These initiatives will not only drive innovation but also align with the improving the job market. Collectively, these efforts can help realize our vision of a ‘Viksit Bharat’ and promote economic progress for all.” Quote on Software product industry sector “India’s software products sector has immense potential to drive innovation and position the country as a global tech leader. To fully realize this potential, it’s important to recognize software products and packaged software as a distinct category and establish the right taxation framework. This will ensure a fair and supportive system that encourages sustainable growth and competitiveness. To further boost the sector, clarifying HSN or SAC codes for virtually exported software products and extending the RoDTEP scheme to cover these exports will help companies claim refunds on taxes paid, enhancing their global competitiveness. At the same time, incentivizing research and development is critical to fostering innovation. Enhanced tax benefits for R&D will drive innovation, strengthen India’s digital ecosystem, and enable the industry to contribute significantly to the nation’s technological advancements and position the country as a global tech leader.” Quote on MSME sector “MSMEs play a vital role in India’s economy, and the upcoming budget is an opportunity to address their challenges while enabling growth. Strengthening the Credit Guarantee Scheme to provide seamless access to affordable funding will help MSMEs reduce their dependence on costly informal sources. Additionally, incentivising investment in the MSME sector will drive more investment towards these businesses, enabling their growth. The government should also look at expanding the Presumptive Taxation regime under Section 44AD to include service providers, freelancers, and small tech-driven businesses, to further simplify compliance and ease operational burdens. The budget should prioritize and focus on skill development, job creation, and simplified regulations to unlock the full potential of MSMEs, empowering them to drive economic growth and innovation.” The insurance industry is expecting important reforms from Union Budget 2025 that will boost the sector’s growth and support the economy. One of the key expectations from the budget is to offer GST relief on health insurance/other employee insurances to MSMEs which employ many more people at the lower spectrum of income in the society. MSMEs usually rely on employee benefits like Group Health Insurance to attract and retain talent. The existing GST regulations create a further burden because MSMEs cannot claim input credit for the GST paid on employee health/life insurance premiums. Although a total waiver may not be feasible for all businesses, the government could consider providing some relief to MSMEs. This can only benefit the budget and country indirectly over a medium to longer term as in this lower income segment covered by MSMEs in absence of such coverages, the population has to rely completely on government subsidies and schemes for either hospitalization or for upliftment of their strata in case of death/disablement of a breadwinner. “As we stand at the cusp of transformative growth in the EV and auto sector, this upcoming budget is an opportunity to redefine EV mobility in India. We anticipate bold steps toward incentivizing EV adoption—through enhanced subsidies especially for Startups, reduced GST on EVs, and incentives for fleet electrification, robust infrastructure development like widespread charging networks. Strengthening the supply chain for and encouraging indigenous manufacturing will be game-changers for the sector. Moreover, bridging the gap between urban and rural EV accessibility is crucial for sustainable growth. Policies promoting research and innovation in clean energy technology will help India emerge as a global EV leader. The auto sector’s revival also requires a balanced focus on green initiatives and supporting traditional manufacturers adapting to new norms. This budget can be a beacon of progress, accelerating our journey toward a greener, smarter, and more self-reliant India.” “Reviving economic momentum requires immediate measures to address food inflation through MSP reforms and supply-side interventions. This will help increase disposable incomes and stabilize family budgets. Blanket monetary tightening has adverse effects on industries like affordable housing, driving up EMIs and increasing default risks. A targeted approach to inflation, especially in essential commodities, is crucial. PMAY Urban 2.0 must be relaunched with a simplified framework, similar to its earlier structure, to effectively cater to low-income groups (LIG). The current delays and cumbersome processes hinder progress and create operational and technological challenges. Centralized administration with robust checks and balances can streamline the scheme, ensuring that it directly addresses the needs of LIG households. The immediate rollout of the mortgage credit guarantee fund will further facilitate housing finance penetration in semi-urban and rural areas, driving deeper structural reforms and contributing significantly to India’s GDP. Additionally, introducing tax incentives on home loan principal or interest will make EMIs more affordable for the LIG segment, empowering them to achieve homeownership under PMAY Urban 2.0. This will significantly advance India’s Housing for All mission, foster infrastructural growth, and provide support to the 400 allied industries linked to real estate. To improve the ease of doing business, a fully digitized SARFAESI process is imperative. Integrating courts, police, and judiciary on a unified platform will streamline repossessions, auctions, and enforcement. Additionally, integrating the Centre and state governments through a transparent network with clearly defined turnaround times (TAT) and exception management will significantly enhance the process. This model will strengthen coordination, close procedural gaps, and ensure swift, transparent action against defaults and fraud.” Arjun Bajaj, Director - Videotex Quote: “The television manufacturing industry has long advocated for the implementation of the PLI scheme and the development of a local ecosystem for critical components such as displays and semiconductors. Additionally, the current 28% GST on 40 inch and larger TVs, which are classified as luxury goods, should be re-evaluated, as these products have become essential. Removing this tax could stimulate sales and benefit the industry. Support for export promotion would unlock new business opportunities. Moreover, the focus should shift from solely expanding manufacturing capabilities to fostering R&D, product innovation, and enhancing operational and production efficiencies. It is also crucial that the government refrains from increasing the import duty on open cell components to help maintain the cost of the final product.” AAVAS, ADANIENT, ADANIPORTS, AJANTPHARM,

Title: How Freaked Out Should We Really Be About Communist China’s New AI Model?
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/01/29/deepseek-chinese-ai-model-openai-chatgpt-stargate-sam-altman-ai-nvidia-open-source/
Time Published: 2025-01-30T01:06:42Z
Full Content:
DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence startup that sent tech stocks reeling this week, sparked fresh concerns about U.S. companies losing their competitive edge in the global race for AI dominance. While DeepSeek claims to have built its R1 model with less than $6 million and limited computing power, some industry analysts say this development poses little threat to America’s AI leadership, with one even suggesting the technology might backfire against Chinese authorities as unwieldy AI could fuel information freedom and social dissent. The Chinese company’s approach, though efficient, comes as U.S. firms push ahead with more ambitious projects and infrastructure investments. “If DeepSeek is as important as all of the papers say it is — and I think that there’s good reason to believe all of this — it makes OpenAI’s projects all the more valuable and all the more feasible in a shorter time period,” Will Rinehart, a senior technology researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. He also called the Chinese startup “the most important firm in AI right now” in his Monday article. deepseek’s r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price. we will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. — Sam Altman (@sama) January 28, 2025 DeepSeek’s new R1 model, he explained, reduces both the financial barriers to AI development and reliance on advanced semiconductors — a key focus of the CHIPS Act. The model achieves comparable performance with significantly fewer parameters, requiring less computational power while maintaining output quality. DeepSeek’s app has already cruised to the top spot on Apple’s App Store ranking, easily surpassing U.S. competitors like ChatGPT and Claude. The startup’s meteoric rise fueled investor doubts about Nvidia — whose hardware has long been considered essential for scaling advanced language models — and triggered a nearly 17% drop in the company’s stock by Monday’s market close. Silicon Valley titan Marc Andreessen even hailed the model as “AI’s Sputnik moment” — but there’s reason to doubt that DeepSeek’s R1 represents another instance of a communist power beating the U.S. to a major technological milestone. Deepseek R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment. — Marc Andreessen 🇺🇸 (@pmarca) January 26, 2025 Rinehart commended DeepSeek for pioneering high-quality AI at minimal cost compared to high-budget U.S. firms, but he doesn’t believe the Chinese startup’s success necessarily spells the downfall of U.S. firms like OpenAI. He explained that, because of its open-source structure, DeepSeek’s R1 offers OpenAI a kind of “playbook” with which it can learn to streamline its own models — opening the door for a symbiotic relationship between the two firms. “What that means is, everyone else can look and see this white paper … and if you know what you’re looking at, you’re like, ‘OK, that’s what they’re doing.’ And so then you can basically avoid research dead ends and generally know which direction for the research to pursue,” Rinehart continued. “But as soon as that happens, that means that other relatively frontier labs can do the same thing.” The “white paper” Rinehart referenced is a document articulating a new language model feature and its applications for AI industry professionals, rather than consumers. Although Rinehart believes that classifying software as simply “open-source” or “closed-source” is overly simplistic for today’s language models, they are still somewhat useful designations: an open-source model like DeepSeek’s is traditionally understood as software that is publicly available for anyone to use, modify or share, which promotes collaboration. A closed-source model like OpenAI’s is understood as one whose code is kept proprietary, limiting access to its underlying systems to authorized employees. He also dismissed the notion that DeepSeek’s model is cost-efficient enough to eliminate OpenAI’s need for Stargate — the president’s $100 billion AI data center infrastructure initiative spearheaded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son — to develop its “next-generation” of data centers to supply computing power for a much higher “projected usage” than currently demanded of DeepSeek. (RELATED: Our Enemies Could Be Plotting To Use Trump’s Ambitious Agenda Against Us) Trump officially unveils “Stargate,” a $500B AI infrastructure initiative led by $MSFT OpenAI, SoftBank $ARM, $NVDA & $ORCL — creating 100,000 jobs & advancing U.S. AI dominance under SoftBank chair Masayoshi Son with OpenAI managing operations.pic.twitter.com/pgVMPBCKBo — Shay Boloor (@StockSavvyShay) January 21, 2025 “My sense is that this is going to continue regardless,” Rinehart said. “OpenAI is looking to basically create the next generation of data centers, and it seems like they’re going to do that regardless … what this new DeepSeek model suggests is that basically all of [OpenAI’s] efforts are potentially boosted at a much cheaper rate, right?” “This shortens my timeline for AGI — for artificial general intelligence, which is what they’re specifically seeking … I mean, gotta give it to Trump, right? He announced one of the most major, important investments in data centers ever. And I think that’s still a win,” he added. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) represents a key goal for the AI industry: an artificial intelligence system capable of matching or exceeding human-level performance across all cognitive or intellectual tasks — though AGI’s precise definition remains a subject of technical and philosophical debate. Dan Schneider, a policy expert and vice president at the Media Research Center, a nonprofit watchdog group, seemed unfazed by the stock market’s reaction to the DeepSeek release in an interview with the DCNF. Nvidia, a longtime favorite among investors, lost nearly $600 billion in market value Monday, the largest single-day decline for any U.S. company in history. “Nvidia’s stock prices had been soaring when people thought that it was a critical incumbent,” Schneider said. “OK, well, this is what happens in a free market system, where a new competitor enters the field and the incumbents then lose value. Wall Street should be optimistic about the value being created for all other businesses and people around the world. Whether you’re in agribusiness, or you’re in banking or you’re making widgets — AI is going to help create more value. This is going to be a great boon to the whole world economy.” Schneider seemed similarly unconcerned about the Chinese company’s growing competitive edge against U.S. firms, arguing that DeepSeek poses less threat to American interests than to the Chinese Communist Party itself. He predicted the technology would eventually spark social upheaval in China, citing his belief that open-source “AI has a real opportunity to end all types of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes” through the free exchange of information. Deep seek interesting prompt.. From Reddit pic.twitter.com/XGqYkTLLlM — Rohan Paul (@rohanpaul_ai) January 26, 2025 “Ultimately, it’s consumers who are going to really benefit. I really believe that AI is going to be key to defeating all sorts of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes,” Schneider said, also acknowledging the Chinese Communist Party will likely “use any kind of technology at its disposal to create weapons” for “nefarious purposes.” The Stargate Project has already begun preliminary construction for its first data center campus in Texas, according to OpenAI.

Title: Robinhood CEO warns US risks losing financial edge without tokenization clarity

Tenev warned that without clear tokenization rules, the US risks losing its financial market dominance to more progressive economies. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev warned that the US could lose its competitive edge in financial markets if regulators fail to provide clear rules for tokenized securities. In a Jan. 28 op-ed for The Washington Post, Tenev argued that blockchain-based financial assets could broaden investment opportunities, allowing retail investors to participate in the early growth of high-profile private companies like OpenAI, SpaceX, and Stripe. He highlighted that these firms have increasingly avoided public markets, limiting investment access to only the wealthiest individuals and widening the gap between institutional and retail investors. According to Tenev: “The world is tokenizing, and the United States should not get left behind. It’s time to update our conversation about crypto from bitcoin and meme coins to what blockchain is really making possible: A new era of ultra-inclusive and customizable investing fit for this century.” Tenev outlined a path for regulators to integrate tokenized securities into the financial system, proposing a security token registration framework as an alternative to traditional IPOs. He argued that companies should have a regulated option to issue tokenized equity, which would provide retail investors with early access to high-growth firms while maintaining proper disclosures and investor protections. Additionally, he called for clear guidelines that would allow exchanges and broker-dealers to facilitate the trading of tokenized assets, ensuring liquidity and market stability. Tenev also noted that the SEC’s accredited investor rule, which currently restricts private market investments to individuals meeting high-income or net-worth thresholds, is another critical issue for the industry. He suggested updating the rule to allow broader participation based on financial literacy rather than wealth alone, a move he believes would democratize investment opportunities and bring US markets in line with other jurisdictions that have adopted more inclusive policies. Tenev’s remarks reflect a growing push among financial leaders for regulatory clarity on tokenization. He recently urged the SEC to approve tokenization efforts to modernize traditional finance. Meanwhile, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently called tokenized securities the “next frontier” in financial markets, arguing that the tokenization of stocks and bonds could make capital markets more efficient. Industry analysts expect tokenization to become a multitrillion-dollar market in the coming years, with McKinsey, BCG, and Bernstein forecasting a rapid expansion of blockchain-based real-world assets. Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring tokenization for bonds, funds, commodities, and real estate, seeking faster settlement times and broader investor participation. Despite mounting industry support, US regulators have yet to establish a clear framework, raising concerns that the country could fall behind financial hubs like the EU, Singapore, and Abu Dhabi. Tenev warned that unless the US acts swiftly, it risks losing its leadership in capital markets as other jurisdictions embrace the next phase of financial innovation.

Title: Microsoft’s AI revenue grows, but its stock falls on lower guidance and concerns over spending

UPDATED 18:41 EST / JANUARY 29 2025 by Mike Wheatley Microsoft Corp. said today that profit from its fiscal second quarter rose 10% from the same period a year ago as it strives to capitalize on the massive investments it has made in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company said its revenue from AI products and related services has now hit an annual run rate of $13 billion, growing from the previous $10 billion run rate it reported three months ago. However, while its profit and revenue surpassed Wall Street’s expectations, the company’s overall cloud computing business fell just short of analyst’s targets. Moreover, its guidance for the current quarter came up short, sending its stock lower after-hours. Microsoft reported earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $3.23 per share, besting Wall Street’s forecast of $3.11. Revenue from the October to December quarter reached $69.63 billion, above the Street’s $68.78 billion target. The company published its fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings report in the wake of larger questions about spending in the AI industry following the emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has achieved dramatic cost-efficiency gains through the use of novel AI training techniques. DeepSeek’s rise has led to some serious scrutiny over the billions of dollars spent on AI infrastructure by Microsoft and its rivals. In the quarter, Microsoft’s capital expenditures reached a new record high of $22.6 billion, with officials citing the need to continue boosting data center capacity to meet demand for its AI offerings and cloud customers. The company said revenue from its Azure cloud computing platform and other cloud services increased 31% in the quarter, a slower pace than the 33% growth recorded three months earlier. Officials said 13% of that growth was attributed to AI services. Azure’s overall growth rate was lower than analysts had expected, and that caused Microsoft’s stock to fall more than 4% in extended trading. Overall, the company’s Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes revenue from Azure, delivered $25.54 billion in sales, up 19% from a year earlier but just shy of the $25.83 billion consensus estimate. Elsewhere, the company’s productivity segment, which includes the Office suite and Teams messenger platform, added $29.4 billion in revenue, up 14% from a year earlier. Sales from the personal computing business, which includes Windows, remained flat at $14.7 billion. Looking to the current quarter, Microsoft’s chief financial officer Amy Hood said on a conference call that the company is looking at sales of between $67.7 billion and $68.7 billion, shy of the Street’s consensus of $69.8 billion. She’s forecasting Azure revenue to grow by 31% to 32%, below the Street’s guidance of 33.4%, blaming it on the need to address execution challenges and problems with capacity constraints. However, Hood said she’s confident that Azure’s growth will accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year, compared to the first half. The latest revenue numbers highlight the rapid pace of Microsoft’s ongoing transition from a product-focused business to a services one, said Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. He pointed out how product revenue declined more than $2.5 billion in the quarter compared to the previous year, though services-based revenue made up for it, growing more than $10 billion. But the successful transition is creating new problems for the company, he said. “The result of this is that earnings per share were up 30 cents year-over-year, but the question on investor’s lips is how long can the company keep this up,” Mueller said. “They’ll be concerned by the comments from Hood, who acknowledged Azure is facing capacity constraints for the first time.” Although the company’s stock fell slightly after-hours, it was still higher than it was on Monday, when it was hit by a broader selloff of technology stocks that was driven by the reaction of ChatGPT competitor DeepSeek. Microsoft’s stock had slipped more than 4% at the start of the week as investors mulled the implications of DeepSeek’s competing models. The Chinese company debuted an open-source “reasoning” model earlier this month that it said was trained at a cost of just $5.6 million, excluding the expense of data and previous research. That sent shockwaves through the AI industry, as its performance matched and sometimes even outperformed comparable models created by OpenAI, Google LLC and Meta Platforms Inc., which cost much more to train. Microsoft is a key backer of OpenAI and it has committed to spending $80 billion on AI infrastructure this year in order to expand its global network of high-powered data centers to meet demand for the specialized chips required to train and run AI models. Somewhat surprisingly, Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella (pictured) said DeepSeek’s R1 model is now available to download through the Azure AI Foundry platform and via GitHub. He added that customers will soon be able to select DeepSeek on Copilot+ personal computers. Regarding DeepSeek’s perceived cost-efficiency gains, Nadella told analysts on the call that “scaling laws” are compounding with regards to both pretraining and inference time compute. “We ourselves have seen significant efficiency gains in both training and inference for years now,” he said. “On inference, we have typically seen more than two-times price-performance gains for every new hardware generation and more than 10-times for every new model generation.” The rise of DeepSeek has stoked fears among some investors that Microsoft may have put its eggs in the wrong basket by throwing its weight behind OpenAI and the infrastructure that supports it, said Valoir analyst Rebecca Wettemann. “We don’t expect companies to move their AI to DeepSeek yet, but that company’s release of lower-cost and less resource-intensive AI models tells us that AI is going to become more commoditized in future,” Wettemann said. “It’s the surrounding platform features that support greater accuracy, security and customization to specific needs that will be the real differentiators, and that’s where Microsoft needs to invest.” Prior to today’s earnings call, Microsoft’s stock had gained 5% in the year to date, outperforming the S&P 500 Index, which was up 3% so far.

Title: Zuckerberg promises 'a pivotal year for the metaverse' as its Reality Labs division continues to bleed cash

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Meta's Reality Labs division continues to bleed billions of dollars — crossing $60 billion in losses since 2020. "This is also going to be a pivotal year for the metaverse," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg confidently told investors on Wednesday. The unit, responsible for its virtual reality headset line "Quest" and its Ray-Ban smart glasses, reported a loss of $5 billion in its Q4 earnings (totaling $17.7 billion in 2024). Its revenue slightly rose 1% year over year to $1.08 billion, driven by hardware sales. Expenses jumped to $6 billion, up 5% year over year. "The number of people using Quest and Horizon has been steadily growing, and this is a year when a number of the long-term investments that we've been working on that will make the metaverse more visually stunning and inspiring will really start to land," Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. Analysts told Yahoo Finance it's questionable whether Zuckerberg's metaverse will ever clock a profit. "There are going to be other ways Meta can monetize its investment down the road but it does look very expensive — like a loss leader in the short term," Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag told Yahoo Finance. "AR is a very expensive technology to develop and I believe most of the money that matters spending in Reality Labs is on AR efforts." A leaked memo earlier this week claimed Reality Labs has hit its sales and user targets. However, current and former employees within the division exclusively tell Yahoo Finance that hitting targets is a small piece of the puzzle. "If their losses are going up and the sales are going up, the question they need to ask themselves is why does the hardware cost so much to make and why aren't they working harder to bring the cost down," said one former Reality Labs manager. "They haven't figured out how to make this profitable and they're not even close." According to market intelligence firm IDC Global, Meta continues to dominate the VR/AR market with a 70% share. "True Augmented Reality headsets such as Meta’s Orion will take time to gain salience as these headsets require high levels of sophistication paired with battery and display tech that are yet to scale," IDC said in its report. Meta's stock has been up 68% in the past year, partially due to the booming investor enthusiasm for AI. Last week, Zuckerberg announced that Meta is planning to spend $60 billion to $65 billion on its artificial intelligence strategy — including a data center "so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan." Wall Street was stopped in its tracks on Monday following the launch of an AI model by Chinese startup DeepSeek, which claimed its large language model was built in two months with less than $6 million. According to reports, Meta set up four war rooms to analyze DeepSeek's technology, two of which focused on reducing training costs. DeepSeek's R1 model now raises a question for analysts: Does Meta need to spend up to $65 billion to deploy AI software? "There's going to be an open-source standard globally and I think for our national advantage it's important that its an American standard," Zuckerberg said. "If anything, some of the recent news has only strengthened our conviction that this the right thing for us to be focused on." "Mark Zuckerberg clearly set expectations that clarity will come to the trajectories of Meta’s long-term initiatives, which includes the metaverse," Forrester's research director Mike Proulx told Yahoo Finance. "While Meta is likely to succeed with its open-source approach to AI, there’s simply nothing to point to in Horizon Worlds that portends success with the metaverse. Despite the company’s name, Meta’s North Star is, and should be, AI." In a note to investors this week, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill expressed optimism about Meta's AI efforts, maintaining a Buy rating and setting a price target of $715. “Overall, we continue to be encouraged by Meta’s ability to sustain DD rev growth, given the combination of higher engagement from AI investments, increased advertiser efficiency, and ramping of incremental monetization formats (e.g. WhatsApp & Llama),” Thill said in the note. Meta's earnings came later than usual. Despite Zuckerberg cozying up to the Trump administration, the Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump signed an agreement calling for Meta to pay $25 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit Trump brought on after his Facebook and Instagram accounts were suspended. According to the report, $22 million of the settlement will go toward a fund set up for Trump's presidential library. A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment.

Title: Amazon to Eliminate ‘Small Number’ of Roles in Communications Department
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/amazon/2025/amazon-to-eliminate-small-number-of-roles-in-communications-department/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T23:33:35Z

Amazon’s communications department is reportedly the latest segment of the company’s corporate workforce to see layoffs. The company is laying off dozens of people in the department, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (Jan. 29). “Following a recent review, we’re making some changes to the Communications & Corporate Responsibility organization to help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and bring teams closer to customers,” Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said in the report. “As part of these changes, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles.” Tens of thousands of corporate jobs have been cut at the company since Andy Jassy became CEO of Amazon in 2021, according to the report. These included 27,000 positions eliminated in corporate job cuts that began in 2022, as well as smaller numbers of layoffs in a series of smaller rounds focused on particular departments and roles, per the report. Jassy said in September that Amazon planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations as part of an effort to “operate like the world’s largest startup.” In a message shared with the company’s employees and posted online at the time, Jassy wrote that Amazon aimed to flatten organizations by asking each of its S-teams, or senior leadership teams, to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. “If we do this well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organization’s ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy wrote at the time. It was reported Jan. 15 that tech giants Meta and Microsoft were cutting back on their headcounts, with Meta set to cut its workforce by 5% and Microsoft planning to pause hiring in part of its consulting business and lay off some employees. According to Layoffs.fyi, a tracker that monitors job cuts in the tech sector, 545 tech companies laid off a total of 152,664 employees in 2024. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average popped 168.61 points, or 0.38%, closing at 44,882.13. At its session highs, it had added nearly 300 points. The S&P 500 rose 0.53% to 6,071.17, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.25% to end at 19,681.75. Stocks cut gains late in the session after President Donald Trump announced his intention to implement 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico. Elsewhere, Wall Street digested recent quarterly results from a slew of megacap tech companies. Shares of Meta Platforms and Tesla respectively added 1.6% and 2.9%, while Microsoft shares dipped 6.2% after the companies reported earnings. Meta beat on top and bottom lines, but Microsoft shares faltered after the company's quarterly revenue forecast disappointed. Tesla shrugged off an earnings and revenue miss. "We had three major megacap technology companies report last night and for the most part, all of them sort of came in and out of their earnings unscathed," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management. "That's a positive when you look at the aggregate number of companies that have reported and how many companies are beating expectations both on the top and bottom lines." On the other hand, investors were a bit cautious to buy after fourth-quarter GDP growth came in at just 2.3%, missing expectations. Wall Street is coming off a losing session after the Federal Reserve paused its interest rate-cutting campaign, leaving its borrowing rate unchanged in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%. In their postmeeting statement, policymakers noted that inflation remains "somewhat elevated." "We kind of get the chance to put the Fed not cutting rates in the rearview mirror because they're likely doing that for the right reasons, meaning the economic data seems consistent with keeping rates unchanged for the time being," Hogan said. "This also gives them time to look at policy from the new administration and try to model out what kind of impact that will have on both the economy and inflation." Other "Magnificent Seven" names are set to report in the coming days, with Apple's results being due for a Thursday release. Amazon will soon follow suit, as the megacap tech company reports next week. Investors are also looking ahead to Friday's personal consumption expenditures price index report for December. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are on pace to end the week in negative territory, despite making up some of their losses from Monday's sell-off. The blue-chip Dow is the only major index tracking for a weekly gain. The U.S. dollar rose against other currencies Thursday afternoon after President Trump said he would impose a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index turned positive on the day after the comments, trading at 108.07. The index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was trading near 107.76 before the remarks. The dollar also rose against the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso individually. — Jesse Pound The major averages cut gains late in the day after President Donald Trump said he would slap a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, two key U.S. trade partners. The Dow, which was up nearly 300 points at one point, briefly turned negative before rebounding. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were also off their highs. — Fred Imbert After monitoring Robert Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation hearings, Citi analyst Geoff Meacham told clients that he expects vaccine-exposed stocks such as Merck and Pfizer will experience some relief after the nominee said he would not deprioritize vaccine approvals at the Food and Drug Administration. Kennedy is hoping to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, but is known for controversial views on vaccinations and for his criticism of ultraprocessed foods. During the hearings, Kennedy voiced support for gene therapies and called GLP-1 treatments "miracle drugs" for those with morbid obesity. Merck and Pfizer shares were up less than 1% in trading Thursday, but GLP-1 drugmakers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly had a bit more momentum. Both stocks were up around 2%. All four stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 since President Donald Trump was elected. Kennedy said he does not believe GLP-1 drugs, which include Wegovy and Zepbound, should be the first treatment used for obesity in children. He also expressed concern over the cost of the drugs. — Christina Cheddar Berk Hasbro and Mattel shares have had a strong start to the new year, rising 6% and 7% year to date, respectively. There may be a good reason for that. Data tracker Circana said global toy sales stabilized last year. The industry's shift to focus on collectibles and adults is helping to plug the gap created by declining birth rates, Circana said. Across the G12 nations, sales fell 0.6% year over year. Average selling price was flat, after four straight years of growth. In the U.S., dollar sales were flat from 2023. In 2023, dollar sales fell 7% in the U.S. from the prior year. Building sets, which include the popular Lego brand, showed both the biggest total sales and the greatest growth rate. Lego has expanded its offerings to include building sets that resonate with adults, who see the toys as a fun way to unwind. "This year we expect the global toy market to be positively impacted by the box office and popular series' on streaming platforms, continuing to fuel young and mature consumer appetites for toys and collectible merchandise," said Frederique Tutt, global toys industry advisor. Hasbro shares are up 17% over the past 12 months, while Mattel logged a nearly 5% gain during the same period. — Christina Cheddar Berk Comcast shares tracked for their worst session in more than a decade and a half as subscriber numbers disappointed Wall Street. Shares of the telecommunications giant, which owns CNBC parent NBCUniversal, tumbled more than 12% in afternoon trading. If that holds through Thursday's closing bell, it will mark the biggest one-day loss for the stock since October 2008, when shares plunged more than 14%. Thursday's sell-off comes after the Philadelphia-based company posted higher losses in broadband subscribers than previously expected. Comcast also reported fewer paid subscriptions to the Peacock streaming service than analysts polled by StreetAccount anticipated. Those stats overshadowed a strong quarterly report, with the company surpassing analysts' forecasts on both lines in the fourth quarter. — Alex Harring, Lillian Rizzo Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC. As crypto becomes increasingly tied into the financial mainstream, crypto-native companies are starting to launch some more traditional products of their own. On Thursday, Grayscale launched a Bitcoin Miners ETF (MRNS). While Grayscale's other exchange-traded funds hold cryptocurrency directly, the new fund is an equity-only fund, similar to traditional sector or thematic funds that have been around for years. "The work of Bitcoin Miners is integral to the existence and continuation of the Bitcoin network. As adoption of Bitcoin grows, we believe the Bitcoin Mining industry will only increase in value. For investors interested in Bitcoin-adjacent opportunities, or looking for an equity expression of Bitcoin, MNRS represents a new option," Grayscale said in a press release. Grayscale is not the only crypto firm trying this strategy, as Bitwise and CoinShares also have equity funds on the market. — Jesse Pound Information technology is down 4.5% week to date, making it the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 during the period. Nvidia's 16.1% drop during the period has led the sector lower. Fellow chipmaker Super Micro Computer has sold off nearly 15%, followed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Juniper Networks down around 13% each. Utilities and industrials have dropped more than 1% for the week, while energy has shed 0.9%. Meanwhile, consumer staples has outperformed the broader market. The sector is up 2.8%, led by J.M. Smucker, Kroger and Costco, which have jumped more than 4% each. — Hakyung Kim Check out some of the companies making headlines in midday trading: Read the full list here. — Brian Evans Small-cap stocks ran circles around their larger counterparts in Thursday's session. The small cap-focused Russell 2000 climbed about 1% in midday trading. By comparison, the S&P 500 traded just slightly above flat. With Thursday's gains, the Russell 2000 sat near flat on week the week, while the S&P 500 was tracking to lose nearly 1%. — Alex Harring The S&P Information Technology Sector was trading 1% lower on Thursday, leading the index's declines for the day. The sector is also the worst performing of the week, down 4% and on pace for its worst weekly performance since September 2024. Tech remains the sole negative sector so far this year. Nvidia, down 16% on the week, leads the sector's declines. Super Micro Computer, Teradyne, ServiceNow and Arista Networks are all down 11% or more on the week. — Nick Wells, Lisa Kailai Han The Department of Justice is suing to block the proposed Hewlett Packard Enterprise acquisition of Juniper Networks on antitrust grounds. The complaint said the merged company, along with rival Cisco Systems, would control "well over 70 percent" of the U.S. market for enterprise wireless network solutions. "This proposed acquisition risks substantially lessening competition in a critically important technology market and thus poses the precise threat that the Clayton Act was enacted to prevent. It should be blocked," the complaint said. Shares of both companies were lower after the complaint was made public. HPE fell 2.5%, while Juniper was down about 3%. — Jesse Pound During Thursday's trading session, 38 stocks in the S&P 500 traded at new 52-week highs. Names that hit this milestone included: On the flip side, nine stocks traded at new 52-week lows. These included UPS, Microchip Technology, Dow and Edison International. — Christopher Hayes, Lisa Kailai Han Shares of Las Vegas Sands were last up 11% on the back of strong Singapore results and renewed optimism due to China's economic recovery. The stock's Thursday gains put it on track for its best day since Sept. 26, 2022, when it rose 11.81%. Las Vegas Sands is currently on pace to notch an 11% weekly rise, which would break its seven-week losing streak — its longest since Aug. 2021. Fellow Macao casino stocks rose in sympathy, with Wynn Resorts, Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International respectively adding 6%, 2% and 1%. — Adrian van Hauwermeiren, Lisa Kailai Han United Parcel Service shares headed for their worst session on record on Thursday, roiled by an announcement that Amazon was slashing volume. Shares tumbled around 17% in morning trading. If that holds, Thursday would mark the biggest one-day loss ever for UPS, which went public in 1999. Thursday's sell-off came after the delivery giant said it reached a deal with Amazon, its largest customer, to lower volume by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. UPS also missed the consensus forecast of analysts polled by LSEG for revenue in the fourth quarter, but earnings per share exceeded their expectations. UPS shares are now down more than 12% in 2025, putting the stock on track for its fourth straight losing year. — Alex Harring Shares of Comcast hit their lowest level in more than two years on Thursday after the telecommunications giant's fourth-quarter report showed the company losing broadband subscribers at a faster-than-projected pace. "Net broadband subscriber additions were negative-139,000 in the fourth quarter, which is disappointing and worse than what we indicated in the fourth quarter," Comcast president Michael Cavanagh said on a conference call Thursday. Company executives said they would be putting more emphasis on the mobile wireless business going forward. Shares were last down 9.5% on the session at $33.80. Comcast's stock price has not been that low since 2022. — Jesse Pound Disclosure: NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC and NBC News. The AI sell-off on Monday dragged down nuclear stocks as well, but the slide for that group was "unwarranted," according to BCA Research strategist Jeremie Peloso. "AI will continue to support future nuclear energy demand. The long-term bullish case for nuclear energy remains intact. Investors should view the recent pullback as a buying opportunity, especially for uranium mining stocks," Peloso wrote in a note to clients. The Range Nuclear Renaissance ETF (NUKZ) enters Thursday down 10.6% for the week, as does Cameco. Shares of Nuscale Power are down more than 21%. Nuclear and uranium stocks got a boost from the AI trade in 2024, with the idea behind that power-hungry data centers will spur expansions to the U.S. energy grid. — Jesse Pound Stocks opened higher on Thursday after ending Wednesday's trading session lower across the board. The S&P 500 added 0.3%, as did the Nasdaq Composite. The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded fractionally higher. — Lisa Kailai Han Check out the companies making headlines before the bell: The full list can be found here. — Hakyung Kim The U.S. economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace during the final three months of 2024. Gross domestic product grew 2.3% in the fourth quarter on an annualized basis, while economists polled by Dow Jones expected an increase of 2.5%. Full-year GDP expanded at a solid 2.8% pace after growing 2.9% in 2023. — Fred Imbert Hot tub maker Whirlpool tumbled 11% following a fourth-quarter revenue miss. Whirlpool's revenue for the last quarter came out to $4.14 billion, while analysts polled by LSEG had expected $4.24 billion. However, Whirlpool's earnings per share of $4.57 exceeded the estimated $4.32 per share. The company estimated that its full-year adjusted earnings would come out to approximately $10 per share versus the $11.60 estimate. Whirlpool's expected full-year net sales of $15.8 billion was also lower than the expected $16.26 billion. — Lisa Kailai Han Shares of Coca-Cola are poised to move higher, according to Jefferies. The firm upgraded the beverage and snack giant to buy and raised its price target to $75, suggesting 19% upside from Wednesday's close. "The business is in great shape," analyst Kaumil Gajrawala wrote. "Volumes are compounding, pricing has been earned, and cash flow is about to inflect … meaningfully." The stock is hard to own when the dollar is strengthening, he noted. However, he expects only a 2-cent effect on earnings per share for 2025. Coca-Cola is set to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 11. "Expect Q4 to be a clearing event, bringing in a wave of investors looking for quality at a fair price," Gajrawala said. "Fundamentals support a higher multiple." Shares are up about 1% so far this year. — Michelle Fox Shares of Cigna plummeted 10% Thursday morning after the health insurer reported a fourth-quarter earnings miss. For its last quarter, Cigna posted adjusted earnings of $6.64 per share, which missed the $7.82 analysts were looking for, according to LSEG. However, Cigna's $65.65 billion in revenue exceeded the $63.36 billion estimate. — Lisa Kailai Han Shares of Lam Research traded 6% higher Thursday morning after the semiconductor company posted a fiscal second-quarter earnings beat. Lam Research reported adjusted earnings of 91 cents per share, above the 88 cents that analysts were looking for, per LSEG. On the other hand, the company's revenue missed FactSet expectations. Lam Research also provided earnings and revenue guidance for its fiscal third quarter that was higher than what analysts were estimating. Following its earnings report, both Bernstein and Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded the stock to an overweight or outperform rating. — Lisa Kailai Han Shares of UPS were trading more than 13% lower Thursday morning after the shipping company posted a fourth-quarter revenue miss. UPS' $25.30 billion in revenue came in lower than the $25.42 billion analysts polled by LSEG had expected. On the other hand, the company's adjusted earnings of $2.75 per share exceeded the Wall Street consensus of $2.53 per share. — Lisa Kailai Han Engine equipment manufacturing stock Caterpillar slipped 4% in Thursday's premarket trading hours after reporting a fourth-quarter earnings miss. Caterpillar's revenue for the quarter came in at $16.22 billion, while analysts polled by LSEG were expecting $16.39 billion. On the other hand, the company's earnings of $5.14 per share exceeded estimates of $5.02. For its new guidance, Caterpillar said it also expects first-quarter 2025 and full-year 2025 sales and revenue numbers to be lower than their 2024 equivalents. — Lisa Kailai Han IBM shares popped 8% in the premarket after the legacy tech company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations.

Title: Nvidia Praises DeepSeek’s Breakthrough Despite Losing $500B in Market Cap Because of It

Earlier this week, an obscure Chinese A.I. startup named DeepSeek shook Silicon Valley after it claimed that it had built a highly capable A.I. model called R1 for a fraction of the cost of its American rivals like OpenAI’s GPT and Google’s Gemini. Major A.I. stocks plummeted in response to the report. Nvidia (NVDA), which makes expensive chips (GPUs) that power the development of such A.I. models, saw its shares slide more than 16 percent on Monday (Jan. 27), erasing nearly $500 billion in its market cap.

You can opt out anytime. Despite the negative financial impact, Nvidia praised DeepSeek’s breakthrough. “DeepSeek is an excellent A.I. advancement and a perfect example of test time scaling,” a company spokesperson told Observer in a statement. “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.” Test-time scaling is a new real-time prediction technique that adjusts an A.I. model’s computational requirements based on the complexity of a task during real-time use. Before that, there were two dominant approaches to scaling an A.I. model: pre-training and post-training. Pre-training scaling expands an A.I. model’s dataset and computing power during initial training while post-training scaling helps fine-tune the model and enhance its real-world performance. According to its research paper, DeepSeek’s R1 model was trained on 2,048 Nvidia H800 chips for a total cost of under $6 million. Some companies and A.I. insiders are skeptical about this claim. For example, Alexandr Wang, the founder and CEO of Scale AI, suspects that DeepSeek may have more Nvidia chips than it’s letting on. Despite leveraging scaling laws, A.I. models often demand significant GPU power during output generation. To counter this, Deepseek said it developed R1 as a “distilled A.I.” model—a smaller model trained to replicate the behavior of larger A.I. systems. Distilled models consume less computational power and memory and offer greater accuracy in tasks such as reasoning and coding, making them an efficient solution for resource-constrained devices such as smartphones. Microsoft and OpenAI are currently investigating whether DeepSeek stole OpenAI’s proprietary data through GPT APIs using “distillation” techniques to build R1’s architecture. “It’s important to note that the $6 million figure for R1 doesn’t account for the prior resources invested,” Itamar Friedman, the former director of machine vision at Alibaba, told Observer. “DeepSeek’s relatively low training cost figure likely represents just the final training step.” Friedman explained that while scaling and optimization are valuable, there are limits to how small an A.I. model or training process can be while still effectively simulating thinking and learning. “Large, high-cost systems will still have a major advantage,” he said. DeepSeek, headquartered in Hangzhou, was founded in 2023 as a spinoff from the hedge fund High-Flyer, led by Liang Wenfeng. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Title: Fundstrat’s Tom Lee Says Stock Market Correction an Overreaction to DeepSeek, Sees Opportunities Flashing

Fundstrat chief investment officer Tom Lee says the market sell-off triggered by the release of low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) model DeepSeek is an overreaction. In a new interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell,” Lee says that Monday’s market correction is likely an opportunity for long-term investors. Stocks and crypto plummeted on Monday as investors processed DeepSeek’s implications, including for AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), one of the hardest hit stocks. “Markets don’t like uncertainty. They like visibility. They like moats. So markets are a little scared [Monday]. To me, it’s an overreaction. The Nvidia decline is the worst since March 2020, and we know that that ended up being a huge opportunity for investors. It’s not a fun day, but I’d be looking at this as an opportunity… This is the nature of technology. I’d be personally surprised if Nvidia became Betamax in the past week. I mean that really would be the kind of change that would be required to really justify selling Nvidia here. Given the need for AI because of global labor shortage and Nvidia chip dominance is still strong, unless a new model emerges that doesn’t require GPUs (graphics processing units) entirely, I’d say that markets just generally do buyer-ready aim.” Lee also says that he is bullish on the financial sector overall in 2025. “Financials, to me, represent a pretty good fundamental case of change this year, because we have a new administration, a Fed that is dovish, yields that aren’t painful for banks, and at a time when it could lead to upside for capital markets activity and multiples are low. So I think financials remain our number one S&P sector idea.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. EV maker Rivian (RIVN) is giving back 3% today after wealth manager Bernstein started coverage of the shares with an Underperform rating. Why Bernstein Is Bearish on RIVN Bernstein believes that the automaker can achieve its goal of handing over 500,000 EVs by 2030, but the wealth manager does not believe that RIVN's attainment of this milestone will provide its shareholders with "financial success." A state-of-the-art electric vehicle charging at a station at a suburban mall. That's because, according to Bernstein, the company's gross margins will only be about 15% by the end of this decade. Additionally, Bernstein believes that Rivian will burn $14 billion of cash before it breaks even. Finally, RIVN will be hindered by the decelerating growth of its markets, stepped-up competition, and the relatively low ceiling of its addressable market, Bernstein warned. The wealth manager placed a $6.10 price target on the name. Rivian Not "Particularly Worried" by Trump's Policies On Jan. 23, RIVN CEO RJ Scaringe said that he was not "particularly worried" about the Trump administration's anti-EV stance. “I don’t think we’re particularly worried about any of it because whatever happens will be equally applied to all, I think in the end it’s sort of like there’s small speed bumps along the way and it’s on us to respond to whatever that environment is,” the CEO explained. While we acknowledge the potential of RIVN, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RIVN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In a note to staffers viewed by CNBC, Drew Herdener, who oversees public relations and corporate responsibility, wrote that the company is eliminating some jobs in those groups as part of a wider review into the "current org design" of the divisions. "As we examined our current org design and decided on the shifts outlined above, we identified some roles that were too narrowly scoped or that introduced unnecessary layers, where we couldn't solve the challenge by flattening the structure or shifting workloads," Herdener wrote. "To address this and do the right thing for the business, we're eliminating a small number of roles in Communications and Sustainability. This is a difficult decision to make and one that my leadership team and I do not take lightly." Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser confirmed the layoffs and said in a statement that the job cuts would "help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and bring teams closer to customers." Bloomberg earlier reported the job cuts. Herdener went on to say that the company may rehire some employees for roles at lower levels, "and in others, we will redistribute the headcount to other areas within the org." Amazon will provide financial support, continued benefits and job-placement assistance to laid-off staffers, Herdener said. Amazon cut more than 27,000 jobs across the company in 2022 and 2023 as part of CEO Andy Jassy's efforts to rein in costs. It had smaller rounds of job cuts in 2024 that are stretching into this year. The company has also continued to wind down some of its more experimental or unprofitable initiatives, including a "Try Before You Buy" clothing service and a speedy brick-and-mortar delivery program. Herdener said Amazon is streamlining its communications and sustainability divisions after the organization "grew quite a bit" in recent years. Herdener's role expanded in recent years and he now also oversees corporate responsibility, which includes the sustainability group. Amazon went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, adding staffers to its corporate workforce and in its hundreds of warehouses across the U.S. Its global workforce swelled to more than 1.6 million by the end of 2021, up from 798,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The company had more than 1.5 million employees as of the end of the third quarter. Amazon is also making some changes to its "hub strategy," which dictates the offices teams primarily use, as part of the reorganization, Herdener said. The goal is to have "more team members working in the same physical location as the majority of their teammates and/or manager," he wrote. Herdener said he is leaving it up to his direct reports to decide which locations make sense for their teams. Earlier this month, Amazon began requiring corporate staffers to spend five days a week in the office. In a push to get employees back to the office, some staffers were told to relocate to hubs in different states. Several Amazon employees told CNBC following the announcement of the "return to hub" policy that they had chosen to leave the company instead of relocating. As part of the five-day office mandate, Amazon also set a goal to flatten its corporate structure by having fewer managers in each organization. Amazon has made sustainability a bigger directive within the company. It set ambitious climate goals in 2019, including a commitment to being carbon neutral by 2040. It also aims to power its business operations with renewable energy sources by 2025, and has amassed a portfolio of more than 500 wind and solar projects globally.

Title: Ireland U20s braced for clash with impressive world champions

Full Content:
Ireland’s nemesis from last season come to Cork on Thursday night as Under-20 Six Nations and World Cup champions, and en route to those titles England twice found a way past Ireland. Mark Mapletoft’s squad prevented Ireland from winning a third successive Grand Slam, when the sides drew 32-32 in a lavishly entertaining encounter at The Rec in Bath. When the dust settled at tournament’s end, England had one more bonus point than their rivals to claim the title. Later in the summer they had a little more leeway on the scoreboard in beating Ireland in a World Cup semi-final before dethroning the reigning champions France in the final. Eight of England’s starting team on Thursday night shared in that world triumph while another two on the bench, Lucas Friday and Josh Bellamy, were part of that success. Northampton Saints scrumhalf Archie McParland played against Ireland in the game last season, while more recently he got a run against Munster in the Champions Cup. The majority of the England team have played for their clubs in the Premiership, while some have also togged out in Europe. Right wing Jack Bracken is a son of Skerries-born former England scrumhalf Kyran Bracken, Henry Pollock is one of the best young players in the world game and was seconded from the senior squad to play, while Junior Kpoku, younger brother of Joel and Jonathan, is a 6ft 8in flanker who has shifted from the second row and plays for Racing in Paris. Ireland’s injury profile has denied them some of last year’s side, Alan Spicer, Shannon duo Luke Murphy and Emmet Calvey, Niall Smyth, Todd Lawlor and hugely promising scrumhalf Will Wootton, younger brother of former Connacht and Munster wing, Alex. There wasn’t any clarification on injuries but it’s a pity Tullamore’s Páidí Farrell, a rare sighting in Irish rugby – a player with top end pace – isn’t getting a run. The home side have a new head coach in Neil Doak, while Séamus Toomey and Andrew Browne have joined Ian Keatley as assistant coaches. Four of Ireland’s front five in the pack have played at this level, including prop Alex Usanov who went on to play for Emerging Ireland in South Africa. Henry Walker, Alex Mullan and Billy Corrigan understand what’s required at this level. Ciarán Mangan, younger brother of Diarmuid, fullback Charlie Molony, centre Connor Fahy, secondrows Corrigan and Mahon Ronan have all played for Leinster A, while centre Eoghan Smyth, the promising Michael Foy and Gene O’Leary Kareem on the bench did so for Munster. Cork-born, Connacht academy prospect Éanna McCarthy captains the team and is joined by flanker Bobby Power and prop Billy Bohan, who were part of the Connacht A scene, while Walker, Clarke Logan, Tom McAllister, Connor Magee and David Green enjoyed that status with Ulster. Doak acknowledged: “The first 20 minutes is key for us, that we get to the level of the game and then stay in there. Like most teams, you have a plan and sometimes you have to adapt to that. We try to make sure that the players are able to solve any problems on the night. “This process it’s part developmental and part performance. From my point of view, all I’m trying to do is get the players the best framework to work from and then they’ve got to problem solve on the pitch. “We can anticipate what England might throw at us, we can anticipate what defensive shapes they may look at, but ultimately on the night, it’s about the players making really clear decisions, going after that and being as positive as they can.” There were a couple of hundred tickets left in midweek, but the game is expected to sell-out, guaranteeing the wonderful atmosphere that’s been a hallmark of Ireland’s run of success at the Cork venue. The home side will have to absorb and channel all that positivity against an England team that are short odds favourites.

Title: Markets slide as Fed holds rates steady, with tech stocks feeling the pressure

The Nasdaq and other major indices declined following the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of the year, with the tech-heavy index falling 1.1% by the afternoon as investors digested the central bank’s cautious stance on interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee kept the overnight borrowing rate unchanged in the 4.25% to 4.50% range and signaled continued caution about potential rate cuts, with recent economic indicators showing mixed signals. “Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,” the FOMC said in a statement. “The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level, and labor market conditions remain solid.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 dropped by 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. Nvidia (NVDA-1.25%), a key player in the AI sector, continued to decline, falling by 6% Wednesday following a massive selloff triggered by DeepSeek. Other AI stocks, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI+2.21%), Micron (MU+3.54%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM+2.58%), also saw losses. Investors are now closely monitoring the earnings reports from Tesla (TSLA+3.38%), Meta (META+1.62%), and Microsoft (MSFT-6.12%), which are due after the market’s close. Shares of coffee giant Starbucks (SBUX+0.12%) jumped over 8% following its earning reports. The Starbucks ceramic mug hype is real – so much so that CEO Brian Niccol mentioned it three times during the company’s Jan. 28 earnings call. The return of the coffeehouse classic is part of Niccol’s broader “Back to Starbucks” strategy, which aims to reestablish the company as a premium coffee brand. This move comes as the company grapples with a slight sales decline, though it exceeded Wall Street’s revenue expectations. “We reintroduced ceramic mugs and handwritten notes on cups to better connect with customers and elevate the cafe experience for those who choose to stay and work,” Niccol said during the earnings call. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT-1.62%) (DJT) shares surged over 7% Wednesday after announcing plans to expand into financial services, including potential investments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The company, majority-owned by President Donald Trump, unveiled a new fintech brand, Truth.Fi, which will launch with up to $250 million. These funds, custodied with brokerage firm Charles Schwab (SCHW+1.44%), will be allocated across customized exchange-traded funds, cryptocurrencies, and other investment vehicles. — Francisco Velasquez contributed to the article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Reports Strong US Revenue Growth, Expands $400M+ US Army Partnership

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs’ 35 AI Superstars. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against the other AI stocks. In September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures. Although the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements—especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. However, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation. While dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. However, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector. Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market’s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A software engineer manipulating a vast network of code on virtual monitors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43 Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in software platforms for big data analytics. There are many aspects that contribute to this company being an excellent investment opportunity. Among them is the company’s consistent efforts to drive positive financial growth across all its quarters for the fiscal year 2024. For instance, as per the report for the third quarter of 2024, the US revenue grew 44% year-over-year and 14% quarter-over-quarter, reaching $499 million. This strong performance follows the second quarter of 2024, where US commercial revenue increased 55% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter, totaling $159 million. Similarly, in the first quarter of 2024, US commercial revenue saw a 40% year-over-year growth and a 14% quarter-over-quarter increase, reaching $150 million. Moreover, the company’s extended long-term partnership with the US Army to deliver the Army Vantage capability in support of the Army Data Platform also positions the company as a strong investment choice. The total value of this agreement is $400,746,583 for a period of up to four years, with a total available ceiling of $618,871,428. Overall PLTR ranks 28th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Trumpcoins, Global Growth and Regulatory Battles Defined Crypto This Week
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2025/trumpcoins-global-growth-and-regulatory-battles-defined-crypto-this-week/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T19:10:45Z
Full Content:
Political favor, institutional acceptance and regulatory scrutiny are increasingly colliding to redefine the digital asset landscape. At the heart of this transformation is the ongoing embrace of digital assets by U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration has moved swiftly to position, or re-position, America as a global leader in the financial technology. As blockchain and cryptocurrency continue to work toward the heart of traditional finance, 2025 is shaping up to be a defining year for investors, businesses and regulators alike — one that could either cement crypto’s place in the global financial system or expose the industry’s lingering vulnerabilities. Either way, the era of digital assets operating in a regulatory gray zone appears to be ending. What comes next will depend on how the industry, and the policymakers shaping its future, navigate this new reality. Beyond politics and regulation, 2025 is already proving to be a year of significant institutional and geographic expansion for the global crypto sector. In Latin America, cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating, with PYMNTS reporting that Bybit is making inroads into taking crypto payments mainstream in Brazil with its new payment solution. According to a Monday (Jan. 27) press release, the Bybit Pay solution is live in Brazil and integrates with the Brazilian Pix instant payment system developed by the Central Bank of Brazil. This move enables users to make payments in both fiat currency and cryptocurrency. The launch of Bybit Pay would also seem to align with Latin America’s growing adoption of digital finance technologies and, in particular, Brazil’s emergence as a digital banking and payments superpower. As PYMNTS Intelligence has found in “How The World Does Digital: A Global Benchmark Of Consumer Digital Transformation,” Brazil leads the world in its digital engagement metrics. Elsewhere in Latin America, it’s all systems go for Coinbase to launch in Argentina after regulators in that South American nation gave their approval for the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange to begin operating there, the company said Tuesday (Jan 28). But perhaps the most striking development in institutional adoption comes from the Czech National Bank (CNB), which is reportedly planning a multi-billion-euro bitcoin purchase. If confirmed, the move, announced Wednesday (Jan. 29), would make the Czech Republic the first Western nation to hold bitcoin as part of its reserves — a landmark shift in how central banks view digital assets. At the same time, blockchain technology is gaining traction within traditional financial markets. Ondo Finance said Tuesday (Jan. 28) that it will bring tokenized U.S. Treasuries to the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The collaboration will offer institutional investors access to Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries (OUSG), which are backed by the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and can be instantaneously minted and redeemed at any time using the Ripple USD (RLUSD) U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin. The tokenization of RWAs has captured the imaginations of various players across payments, finance and commerce because it has the potential to make assets more liquid, accessible and efficient, PYMNTS reported last April. During the most recent Eurogroup meeting in January, the European Central Bank (ECB) provided an update on its exploratory work on tokenization and blockchain’s role in streamlining the wholesale settlement of transactions, reporting to the ministers present that the technology is capable of solving inefficiencies, reducing risks, and unlocking new opportunities within wholesale trade. This maturation of the cross-border landscape could ultimately redefine how growth-focused treasurers and CFOs manage global transactions, liquidity and risk. At the same time, and perhaps unsurprisingly, Elon Musk is reportedly considering using blockchain technology at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), per a Saturday (Jan. 25) report. Musk, head of the newly created agency, has floated the idea of using a digital ledger to monitor federal spending, make payments, secure data and manage government buildings. Donald Trump’s return to the White House has given the crypto industry its most powerful political advocate yet. Just days into his second term, America’s first “crypto president” issued an executive order, titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” touching on many of the sector’s wants, needs and concerns. Now, however, Trump is leaning into digital assets — not just as a policy matter, but as a business opportunity. His media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), on Wednesday (Jan. 29) announced plans to expand into financial services, including cryptocurrency-related offerings. News broke the same day that websites selling products with President Donald Trump’s brand are now accepting the controversial $TRUMP meme coin as payment. The newfound support has also prompted shifts in institutional investment strategies. Per a Sunday (Jan. 26) report, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is even shutting down its U.K. office amid a new focus on the U.S. crypto sector following Donald Trump’s election. The investor opened the U.K. branch in 2023, its first outside the U.S., amid regulatory pressure in the U.S. The move back could underscore a belief that the U.S. is once again a more favorable jurisdiction for blockchain innovation — at least under the current administration. Separately, U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken now lets users make payments with their accounts. Kraken Pay allows users to choose the crypto or fiat currency in their accounts that they want to send and transmit that payment instantly, according to a Wednesday (Jan. 29) company blog post. While political support is boosting industry confidence, crypto firms are still facing regulatory headwinds. Governments across the globe are tightening compliance standards, cracking down on illicit activity, and enforcing penalties against firms accused of skirting financial regulations. French authorities recently launched a probe against Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, over allegations of money laundering. The investigation adds to Binance’s growing list of legal troubles, which include lawsuits and regulatory actions in multiple jurisdictions. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin will exit the U.S. market for at least two years after its operator, Seychelles-based Peken Global Limited, pleaded guilty Monday (Jan. 27) to one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Peken will also pay monetary penalties totaling more than $297 million, while two of its founders, Chun (Michael) Gan and Ke (Eric) Tang, will step down from any role in KuCoin’s management or operations. U.S. Attorney Danielle R. Sassoon said in the release that KuCoin avoided implementing required anti-money laundering (AML) policies for years. “As a result, KuCoin was used to facilitate billions of dollars’ worth of suspicious transactions and to transmit potentially criminal proceeds, including proceeds from darknet markets and malware, ransomware and fraud schemes,” Sassoon said. “Today’s guilty plea and penalties show the cost of refusing to follow these laws and allowing unlawful activity to continue.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Says President Trump’s Executive Order Could End Crypto’s Four-Year Cycle – Here’s Why

Crypto’s traditional four-year cycle could come to an end because of President Trump’s executive order, according to Bitwise’s chief investment officer Matt Hougan. In a new note to investors, Hougan says that the four-year cycle appeared to be intact – until Trump came out with the “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology” executive order. The executive order directs the United States government to promote stablecoins, end regulatory persecution of digital assets, the evaluation of a national crypto reserve, and other initiatives. The four-year cycle is based on the idea that crypto follows Bitcoin’s halvings when BTC miners’ rewards are cut in half, which happen roughly every four years and tend to precede upward price movements. While the four-year cycle is widely accepted as the norm by many crypto investors, Hougan says that the pattern might now be broken due to the implications of Trump’s executive orders, the implications of which could take years to play out. “The thing I’m wrestling with is that the downstream positive effects of the EO, plus the other changes in Washington, will be felt over the course of years, not months. In the absolute best-case scenario, it will take a year to align on and implement a new regulatory framework for crypto. It will take longer than that for the behemoths on Wall Street to fully orient themselves to crypto’s possibilities. If it’s not until next year that we feel those impacts, will we really have a new “crypto winter” in 2026? Will investors go into hibernation even though they know we’ve entered a new crypto-enabled world? If BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is calling for $700k Bitcoin, are we really going to see a 70% pullback? My guess is that we haven’t fully overcome the four-year cycle. Leverage will build up as the bull market builds. Excess will appear. Bad actors will emerge. And at some point, there could be a sharp pullback when the market gets over its skis. But my guess is that any pullback will be shorter and shallower than in years past. Why? The crypto space has matured; there’s a greater variety of buyers and more value-oriented investors than ever before. I expect volatility, but I’m not sure I’d bet against crypto in 2026. As for now, it’s full steam ahead. The crypto train is leaving the station.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 6.9% in the afternoon session after Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration is considering curbing sales of the company's chips to China following the emergence of the DeepSeek AI model. According to the sources, the restriction might apply to some of Nvidia's cutting-edge chips, including the H20 AI chips. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Nvidia’s shares are very volatile and have had 26 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock dropped 13% on the news that stocks heavily tied to the AI market took a hit after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek released a new large language model (DeepSeek-R1) that ranks competitively on key global benchmarks (coding competitions, math evaluations), uses less advanced semiconductor chips, costs significantly less to build (at $5.5 million - excluding non-compute costs), and has already achieved strong adoption after topping the iPhone App Store for AI apps. Notably, the company has also open-sourced this model, a move that may make it harder for rivals to justify huge upfront expenditures on hardware, software, and expertise to develop similar systems. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised DeepSeek's efforts, calling the new model "super impressive" for its open-source design, efficient inference-time computing, and high compute efficiency. "We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously," he added. Nadella's comments suggest that upstarts like DeepSeek could reshape the competitive landscape of AI. DeepSeek's announcement disrupts long-held assumptions in key ways: 1) It undercuts the narrative that bigger budgets and access to top-tier chips are the only ways forward for AI development. 2) By using less advanced hardware, DeepSeek opens the door for innovators who face high chip costs or export restrictions, reaffirming they can still compete. 3.) The model's success questions the growth narrative of chipmakers like Nvidia—whose soaring valuations depend on the demand for cutting-edge, high-performance hardware. Overall, DeepSeek's model demonstrates that AI innovation is no longer a race fueled solely by how much you spend, but rather by how resourceful you can be with what you have. Nvidia is down 12.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $121.52 per share, it is trading 18.7% below its 52-week high of $149.43 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $19,796. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

Title: Nvidia Stock Drops Wednesday as AI Chipmaker's Roller-Coaster Week Continues

Nvidia (NVDA) shares tumbled nearly 6% in intraday trading Wednesday, dashing hopes for a quick recovery from losses earlier in the week amid concerns about competitiveness of American AI firms and their spending on the emerging technology. The AI chipmaker's stock led losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and was among the top decliners on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Wednesday. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO), Palantir (PLTR), and several other AI darlings over the past year also were lower. The surging popularity of an app from Chinese startup DeepSeek, which runs on an AI model it claimed can perform on par with American rivals at a fraction of the cost, had sent Nvidia and a slew of other U.S. tech stocks into a tailspin Monday. Despite a brief rebound in Tuesday's session, the tech sector fell back into the red Wednesday as Chinese tech giant Alibaba (BABA) rolled out a new AI model it says can outperform models from DeepSeek, OpenAI, and Meta Platforms (META). The rapid rise of lower-cost models from Chinese companies that can compete with those from leading American firms has spurred a reckoning on Wall Street, with earnings from Meta and Microsoft (MSFT) likely to be in the spotlight later tonight as both firms face pressure to prove their AI investments can yield results that justify the costs. Analysts have so far remained mostly bullish on their prospects, with Morgan Stanley analysts telling clients that advances by DeekSeek could prove "positive" for Microsoft and Meta, suggesting Meta could implement them and that Microsoft's Azure platform would benefit from a proliferation of AI models and consumer applications. Bank of America analysts told clients in a note Wednesday they see this as "AI's Sputnik moment," suggesting competition could push U.S. hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL) to spend even more on AI, to the benefit of Nvidia, Broadcom, and other AI chipmakers. They reiterated a "buy" rating and $190 price target for Nvidia's stock, adding they "view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity."

Title: Robinhood CEO Warns Lack of U.S. Regulation Stifles Security Tokenization Efforts

Current U.S. regulations are blocking a major financial shift that could open up private-market investments to everyday investors through tokenization, CEO of digital brokerage Robinhood Vlad Tenev said. In a Wednesday opinion piece for the Washington Post, Tenev said that many high-growth companies like OpenAI, SpaceX and Stripe are increasingly avoiding going public, limiting investment access to a small circle of wealthy investors, widening the investment gap between retail investors. Tokenizing private equity through blockchain technology that underpins crypto markets would allow retail to access companies early in their growth phase, lowering barriers while keeping proper disclosures and investor protections, Tenev argued. "The world is tokenizing, and the United States should not get left behind," Tenev wrote. "It’s time to update our conversation about crypto from bitcoin and meme coins to what blockchain is really making possible: A new era of ultra-inclusive and customizable investing fit for this century." However, U.S. regulators, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have yet to provide a clear framework and rules for registering security tokens, while other key markets such as the EU, Singapore and Abu Dhabi are already advancing in this area, he said. He proposed creating a security token registration framework as an alternative to IPOs, providing clear guidelines for exchanges and broker-dealers to support tokenized assets and updating accredited investor rules to allow access based on financial knowledge instead of wealth. Tokenization is a booming sector at the intersection of crypto and traditional finance that could become a multitrillion-dollar market this decade, per forecasts by McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein . Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring placing real-world assets like bonds, funds and commodities and real estate on blockchain rails in a digital token form to achieve speedier settlements and broader investor accessibility. Tenev is the latest high-profile leader in the financial world touting tokenization and calling for clear rules for tokenized securities. Larry Fink, CEO of $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock, recently said that tokenization is the next frontier that will change markets, and urged the SEC in a CNBC interview to "rapidly approve" tokenization of stocks and bonds.

European shares closed at a record high on Wednesday, boosted by technology stocks following strong results from chip equipment maker ASML, while investors shifted their focus to a monetary policy verdict by the US Federal Reserve. After the Fed decision, due after the close of European markets, attention will to turn to the European Central Bank (ECB), which is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points on Thursday. The Iseq closed 0.2 per cent lower, as Ryanair came under pressure, declining 0.8 per cent to €20.32, despite comments from chief executive Michael O’Leary that he expects Boeing to be given the go-ahead to ramp up production of its 737 jets this year beyond the current regulator-imposed cap of 38 per month. Glanbia lost 1.7 per cent to finish at €14.30, Kerry was down 0.6 per cent at €99.50 and Cairn Homes fell 0.9 per cent to €2.14, while Kingspan edged 0.3 per cent lower to €68.20. Bank of Ireland was one of the key gainers in the session, with its stock rising 1.5 per cent to €9.82. The FTSE 100 inched 0.3 per cent higher, boosted by gains in the technology and financial sectors, while the pound slipped after chancellor of the exchequer Rachel Reeves’s dovish remarks on resetting ties with the EU and the US. The mid-cap FTSE 250 nudged down 0.1 per cent. Financials stocks such as HSBC and Barclays rose 1.4 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively, while NatWest Group ticked up 2.3 per cent. Automobile shares jumped 3.8 per cent. The majority of that boost came from a 7.5 per cent pop in shares of Dowlais Group after US autoparts maker American Axle and Manufacturing said it will buy it in a cash-and-stock deal. Mexico’s second-largest gold miner Fresnillo was one of the top gainers, with a 2.7 per cent rise after it posted full-year gold production slightly ahead of market outlook. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was up 0.5 per cent, logging its biggest one-day jump in more than one week. The technology sector led gains with a 2.5 per cent rise. ASML surged 5.6 per cent after the Dutch company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter bookings of €7.09 billion. The chip equipment maker’s earnings also reassured investors that AI chip prospects were still healthy, as they recovered from a selloff sparked by the release of China’s DeepSeek’s model, which uses less computing power than those of rivals. Other semiconductor stocks STMicroelectronics, BE Semiconductor and ASM International gained between 0.8 per cent and 3.1 per cent. Germany’s Dax added 0.9 per cent to close at a record high, boosted by a 4.5 per cent jump in Deutsche Telekom after US peer T-Mobile issued a robust subscriber growth forecast. Swedish truck maker Volvo jumped 7.7 per cent after reporting strong orders for the fourth quarter. Limiting gains, LVMH fell 4.9 per cent as the luxury goods group’s sales growth failed to impress investors following a string of strong results from rivals and recent price gains. Kering and Christian Dior also declined about 5 per cent. The French benchmark CAC 40 index was the only benchmark among major EU economies in the red. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq slipped ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate decision. Nvidia fell 4.6 per cent after rising close to 9 per cent on Tuesday. Its shares were hammered on Monday, after Chinese startup DeepSeek launched AI models. Apple shed 0.6 per cent after brokerage Oppenheimer downgraded its rating to “perform” from “outperform”. The iPhone maker is scheduled to report quarterly earnings later this week. Earnings from “Magnificent Seven” stocks Microsoft, Facebook-parent Meta and Tesla are expected after markets close, as are Intel’s.

Title: Intel will report its Q4 earnings as company seeks permanent CEO

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) will report its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, its first such announcement since the company ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger over frustrations with his enormous turnaround effort. Intel is currently being led by co-CEOs David Zinsner, who also serves as CFO, and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, who is also CEO of Intel Products. The company is still searching for a permanent CEO to take the reins and attempt to revitalize the storied chipmaker. Intel stock is down a staggering 54% over the last 12 months and reported the largest quarterly loss in its history last quarter. Intel isn’t the only chipmaker hurting, though. Rival AMD (AMD) is down 36% throughout the last year. Nvidia (NVDA), however, continues to gain steam, rising 93% in the last year, despite suffering a massive rout on Monday on the back of worries related to China’s DeepSeek AI. Intel’s still-nascent foundry business, which both produces chips for Intel and is designed to act as a contract manufacturer for third parties, continues to be a drag on its overall revenue despite announcing agreements to build chips for Amazon’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services and Microsoft (MSFT). Intel is expected to report earnings per share of $0.12 on revenue of $13.8 billion in the quarter, according to Bloomberg consensus data. That’s a drop from the $0.54 per share and $15.4 billion in revenue the company reported in Q4 last year. Intel’s Client Computing business, which includes chips for PCs, is set to top out at $7.8 billion, down from $8.8 billion last year, while its data center business is expected to reach $3.3 billion, down from $3.9 billion last year. The Intel Foundry business is expected to hit $4.5 billion, up from $291 million in Q4 2023. Intel is working to build out new facilities to research and construct chips across the US, but the company is dealing with a relatively flat PC market despite promises that AI PCs would help buoy the space in 2024. According to IDC, PC shipments rose just 1% in 2024, and there’s still plenty of uncertainty about 2025. “The overall macroeconomic concerns seem to be overshadowing some of the progress and excitement around AI PCs,” Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC's Worldwide Device Trackers, said in a statement. “However, we maintain the view that the impact that on-device AI will have on the industry will be positive, even if the inflection point is delayed.” The company’s data center business is also struggling to catch up to the likes of Nvidia. While Intel is working to develop its own AI chips, it’s still far behind market leaders, and there’s no clear understanding as to if and when it could catch up.

The Chinese startup has impressed the tech sector with its robust large language model, built on open-source technology. DeepSeek has also sent shockwaves through the AI industry, showing that it's possible to develop a powerful AI for millions in hardware and training, when American companies like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft have invested billions. DeepSeek is the brainchild of investor and entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng, a Chinese national who studied electronic information and communication engineering at Zhejiang University. Liang began his career in AI by using it for quantitative trading, co-founding the Hangzhou, China-based hedge fund High-Flyer Quantitative Investment Management in 2015. In 2023, Liang launched DeepSeek, focusing on advancing artificial general intelligence. DeepSeek launched its first large language model, DeepSeek-Coder, on November 29, 2023. But it wasn't until January 20, 2025, with the release of DeepSeek-R1, that the company upended the AI industry. With a team of just 200 people and a budget of $6 million, DeepSeek released its free, open-source model, which was on par with OpenAI's much-ballyhooed GPT 01 model—a project that cost as much as $600 million and took an an estimated 3,500 people two years to build. 🚀 DeepSeek-R1 is here! ⚡ Performance on par with OpenAI-o1📖 Fully open-source model & technical report🏆 MIT licensed: Distill & commercialize freely! 🌐 Website & API are live now! Try DeepThink at https://t.co/v1TFy7LHNy today! 🐋 1/n pic.twitter.com/7BlpWAPu6y — DeepSeek (@deepseek_ai) January 20, 2025 Unlike big tech companies with big payrolls in the west, DeepSeek optimized its hiring to focus on recently graduated students: "Three to five years of work experience is the maximum, and those with more than eight years of work experience are basically rejected," a headhunter told 36kr, a popular Chinese tech site. And, whereas OpenAI and other dominant AI models were mainly available as subscription products, DeepSeek’s code is open source, available for public scrutiny and can be downloaded to a local computer via AI playground Huggingface, or as a phone app, for free. DeepSeek’s underlying technology was considered a massive breakthrough in AI and its release sent shockwaves through the US tech sector, wiping out $1 trillion in value in one day. DeepSeek's success comes from its approach to model design and training. Like a massively parallel supercomputer that divides tasks among many processors to work on them simultaneously, DeepSeek’s Mixture-of-Experts system selectively activates only about 37 billion of its 671 billion parameters for each task. This approach significantly improves efficiency, reducing computational costs while still delivering top-tier performance across applications. DeepSeek enhances its training process using Group Relative Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning technique that improves decision-making by comparing a model’s choices against those of similar learning agents. This allows the AI to refine its reasoning more effectively, producing higher-quality training data. DeepSeek has also demonstrated a commitment to open-source accessibility by releasing its models under the MIT license, which allows users to download, deploy, and customize the AI model, distinguishing it from competitors that maintain closed and proprietary systems. Open-source also allows developers to improve upon and share their work with others who can then build on that work in an endless cycle of evolution and improvement. DeepSeek's development is helped by a stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips combined with less expensive hardware. Some estimates put the number of Nvidia chips DeepSeek has access to at around 50,000 GPUs, compared to the 500,000 OpenAI used to train ChatGPT. Many AI technologists have lauded DeepSeek’s powerful, efficient, and low-cost model, while critics have raised concerns about data privacy security. “We are living in a timeline where a non-US company is keeping the original mission of OpenAI alive—truly open, frontier research that empowers all. It makes no sense,” Nvidia Senior Research Manager Dr. Jim Fan wrote on X (formerly Twitter). “The most entertaining outcome is the most likely.” This is the DeepSeek R1 Reasoning Engine running Grok-1 Open Source. The Reasoning Engine allows for new life to be given to older models. It is absolutely fascinating how it works. Look in and see: pic.twitter.com/FErN8TrOF8 — Brian Roemmele (@BrianRoemmele) January 28, 2025 Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged that DeepSeek is impressive. “We will obviously deliver much better models and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor!” Altman said on X. Days later, though, the firm claimed to have found evidence that DeepSeek used OpenAI's proprietary models to train its own rival model. Critics have also raised questions about DeepSeek's terms of service, cybersecurity practices, and potential ties to the Chinese government. Others have highlighted the extensive amount of user data collected by DeepSeek, including device models, operating systems, keystroke patterns, and IP addresses—data that’s stored on DeepSeek’s China-based servers, according to the firm’s privacy policy. As a general news and also security awareness:Deepseek is a new LLM and it's powerful, but there is a caveat, they collect keystroke patterns, this is not common and can be used to identify yourself in the future in any device or website as keystroke patterns are like individual… pic.twitter.com/8pn1EkzN2K — Raphael de Monticello (@RaphaMonticello) January 23, 2025 “Privacy is an issue because it's China. It’s always about collecting data from users. So user beware,” Kevin Surace, CEO at AI software developer Appvance, told Decrypt. “It will force everyone to rethink how we train models and how much power is required for inference.” DeepSeek’s rapid rise challenges the dominance of Western tech giants and raises significant questions about the future of AI—who builds it, who controls it, and how open and affordable for all it should be. But questions remain about the long-term implications of DeepSeek and whether U.S. President Trump will respond to China's apparent overnight dominance in the AI sector with a TikTok-style ban. Did High-Flyer misrepresent its use of GPUs to make DeepSeek seem more efficient than it actually is? Was DeepSeek’s sudden public launch timed to drive down Nvidia’s stock for the benefit of well-positioned investors? As competitors, including Meta and Perplexity AI, scramble to adapt to DeepSeek’s methodology, the full impact of this AI breakthrough remains uncertain. But one thing is clear: DeepSeek shook up the tech industry by proving yet again that sometimes, resource constraints force innovative breakthroughs and that powerful technology can be built without multi-billion-dollar price tags.

HONG KONG, CHINA - JANUARY 28: Global tech stocks have plummeted following the emergence of ... [+] DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that has developed a competitive AI model at a fraction of the cost of its US rivals, sparking concerns about the high valuations of tech giants like Nvidia. This development has led to significant declines in tech shares across Asia and Europe, with markets in both regions experiencing notable losses as investors reassess the AI landscape and its potential impact on the industry's future. (Photo illustration by Anthony Kwan/Getty Images) A seismic shift in artificial intelligence is underway that promises to reshape not just the tech industry, but the very foundations of major stock indices. At the epicenter of this transformation lies DeepSeek, a Chinese company that has been quietly revolutionizing the artificial intelligence field with its cost-effective, high-performance models. This development is not just a ripple in the tech pond; it’s a tsunami that could wash away established assumptions about AI infrastructure and market valuations. DeepSeek is challenging the status quo in a way that’s sending shockwaves through Silicon Valley and beyond. The company’s flagship model, DeepSeek-R1, isn’t just another entrant in the AI race — it’s a potential game-changer that’s rewriting the rules of engagement. The conventional wisdom in AI has long been that cutting-edge performance comes with a cutting-edge price tag. DeepSeek is turning this notion on its head. According to a comparison by Artificial Analysis, DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated capabilities that not only rival but can even surpass those of industry leaders like OpenAI’s GPT-4. The kicker? It’s achieving these feats at — in some cases — a fraction of the cost. This efficiency breakthrough isn’t just a technical achievement; it’s a potential market disruptor of immense proportions. As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella cautioned at Davos, “We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.” Coming from the leader of a company that has poured billions into OpenAI and AI-integrated products like Copilot, these words carry the weight of a market bellwether. The ramifications of DeepSeek’s advancements extend far beyond the tech sector, potentially shaking the very foundations of major market indices. Consider this sobering statistic: Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta — the vanguard of the AI revolution — collectively represent about 24% of the S&P 500 and a whopping 32% of the Nasdaq 100. These tech titans have been riding the crest of the AI wave, their valuations soaring to stratospheric heights on the back of AI hype and promise. But what happens when the bedrock of these valuations — the assumed necessity of expensive AI infrastructure — begins to crumble? Nvidia, the chip manufacturer whose GPUs have become synonymous with AI computing, finds itself in a particularly precarious position. In Q2 2024, a staggering 46% of Nvidia’s revenue came from just four companies, likely including tech behemoths Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta. This concentration of revenue sources, once seen as a strength, now looks increasingly like a potential Achilles’ heel. The $40,000 Nvidia Blackwell chips, once considered the gold standard and a necessary investment for high-performance AI, may now be viewed through a more critical lens. DeepSeek is proving that top-tier AI performance doesn’t necessarily require top-dollar hardware, a realization that could send shockwaves through Nvidia’s client base and, by extension, its bottom line. This paradigm shift suggests we’re entering a new phase in AI development, one that could redefine winners and losers in the tech space. The focus is moving away from raw computing power and towards efficient model design and practical implementation. In the framework of transformative technology, we’re witnessing a transition from Phase 3 to Phase 4. For investors, this transition necessitates a reevaluation of where value truly lies in the AI ecosystem. The new darlings of Wall Street may well be companies that can effectively implement AI models to solve real-world problems and improve productivity, rather than those simply building bigger and more expensive AI infrastructure. Given the concentration of major indices in AI-centric companies, the market implications of this shift could be profound and far-reaching. We could be on the cusp of a significant near-term market correction as investors scramble to reassess their positions in light of this new paradigm. Despite the potential for short-term turbulence, the long-term outlook for AI remains robust and promising. According to projections from MarketsandMarkets, the global AI market is set to reach a staggering $190.61 billion by 2025, with a compounded annual growth rate of 36.62% from 2024 to 2025. These numbers underscore the enduring potential of AI, even as the industry undergoes a transformative shift. For investors and industry players alike, navigating this new AI landscape will require a recalibration of strategies and expectations. The winners in this new era of AI may not be the companies with the biggest infrastructure investments, but those that can most effectively harness AI’s potential to drive real-world value and productivity gains. As we stand on the brink of this AI revolution, one thing is clear: The tech industry and the market indices that have long been buoyed by its giants are in for a period of significant upheaval. DeepSeek’s breakthrough serves as a stark reminder that in the world of technology, today’s paradigm can quickly become tomorrow’s outdated model. For investors, this presents both challenges and opportunities. The key will be to look beyond the hype and focus on companies that are not just talking about AI, but effectively implementing it in ways that drive tangible value. As the dust settles on this paradigm shift, we may well see a new hierarchy emerge in the tech world — one that values efficiency and practical application over sheer computational might. In this brave new world of AI, the ability to adapt quickly and pivot strategies may prove just as valuable as any technological advantage. As we watch this story unfold, one thing is certain: the AI revolution is far from over. It will take a decade or more for AI to mature and for its potential to be realized, cost reductions through more efficient uses of compute power will be key in adoption and accessibility to AI. DeepSeek has started the essential push toward efficiency, but we are just witnessing the opening chapter of AI’s true transformative potential. Investors should consider how long of a road there is ahead for AI and make sure to size their bets conservatively as there will be many more surprises like DeepSeek ahead. One Community.

Title: Should You Buy Nvidia Stock in the Wake of the DeepSeek Bombshell? Here's What Wall Street Is Saying.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/29/2025 9:43:48 AM PST by SeekAndFind Technology stocks were rocked to their core Monday after claims made by a Chinese start-up threatened to upend the existing artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm.There’s a compelling argument that recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) could have vast implications for the future. Over the past couple of years, advances in generative AI have helped fuel a roaring bull market with promises of significant productivity increases. The potential windfall of increased profits has companies racing to adopt these next-generation algorithms.One of the biggest beneficiaries of these secular tailwinds has been Nvidia (NVDA 8.93%). The company’s graphic processing units (GPUs), which were initially developed for gaming applications, proved equally adept at supplying the computational horsepower needed for AI. Robust sales of these processors fueled a parabolic rise, sending Nvidia stock up more than 500% over the past two years.However, claims made by Chinese start-up DeepSeek threatened to upset the existing paradigm, sending Nvidia into a tailspin. The stock slumped 17% and lost nearly $600 billion in market cap in a single day. Nevertheless, after a good night’s sleep, Wall Street has some thoughts on the matter.Perspective is requiredEdgar Allan Poe famously wrote, “Believe nothing you hear, and only one half that you see.” Wall Street seems to be taking that approach, to a certain extent, regarding some of the assertions made by DeepSeek. Specifically, claims that it created its chatbot for $5.6 million are being met with skepticism by some analysts.Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note to clients (emphasis mine), “Did DeepSeek really ‘build OpenAI for $5M?’ Of course not.” The analyst suggested that many of the routine expenses and development costs were left out of the total. “DeepSeek’s R1 paper did not quantify the additional resources that were required to develop the R1 model (presumably they were substantial as well),” he wrote.Many investors panicked on Monday, fearing that more efficient AI models would mean less business for Nvidia, but that’s likely not the case. According to Jevons paradox, efficiency gains from technological advancements generally increase demand by bringing costs down. Put another way, lower-cost AI models will drive increased adoption, which will increase demand for Nvidia’s AI-centric processors.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse took a similar position: “Innovation is driving down cost of adoption and making AI ubiquitous,” he wrote. “We see this progress as positive in the need for more and more compute over time (not less).” This bodes well for Nvidia.Tigress Financial upgraded Nvidia to strong buy on Tuesday and increased its price target on the stock to a Street-high $220. That represents potential upside for investors of 71% compared to Tuesday’s closing price. The analyst believes that the data center growth needed to support AI will continue unabated and Nvidia — which controls a dominant share of the data center GPU market — will continue to profit from this trend.Even in the wake of the DeepSeek bombshell, Wall Street is almost universally behind Nvidia. Of the 63 analysts who have offered an opinion thus far in January, 94% rate it a buy or strong buy, and none recommend selling.This shows that Wall Street remains remarkably bullish on Nvidia despite DeepSeek’s seemingly earthshaking developments.The Motley Fool’s OpinionOn Jan. 27, a roundtable discussion among Fool analysts took place, and they debated the issues surrounding DeepSeek’s announcement. From that conversation, several highlights stand out:The panelists echoed the question of whether it cost just $5.6 million to train DeepSeek’s chatbot. A review of the white paper supplied by DeepSeek seems to suggest that this only includes the cost for the most recent version and none of the development that preceded it.The DeepSeek AI assistant recently became the No.1 downloaded free app on the Apple Store. However, there seems to be a discrepancy between the number of downloads and the actual app usage, which could call into question the veracity of these statistics.Those caveats aside, there’s the potential that this is the natural evolution of the technology. As resources become more scarce, the focus will inevitably turn toward innovation, breeding the next generation of advancements.Even if this represents a breakthrough in AI development, it likely won’t reduce the need for Nvidia’s state-of-the-art processors, as they will continue to play a crucial role in training AI models.The group generally agreed that Nvidia’s premium valuation would lead to increased volatility, which would test the mettle of investors.Collectively, the evidence suggests that DeepSeek’s bombshell was more of an inevitable evolution of technology than a major breakthrough.It’s still the early days of the AI revolution, and as such, investors should expect more “bombshell” developments in the field in the months and years to come. Some investors were scared out of Nvidia on Monday, but having a knee-jerk reaction to news like this could be a costly mistake.Data by YChartsFinally, Nvidia stock is currently selling for roughly 50 times earnings. While that might be enough to send value investors headed for the exits, that’s far below Nvidia’s average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 81 over the past five years, making it relatively inexpensive from a historical perspective. Furthermore, the stock gained more than 2,000% during that same period, which illustrates why it is worthy of a premium.Given the company’s long track record and history of innovation, I still believe Nvidia is a worthwhile investment. There’s a compelling argument that recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) could have vast implications for the future.

From that conversation, several highlights stand out:The panelists echoed the question of whether it cost just $5.6 million to train DeepSeek’s chatbot. A review of the white paper supplied by DeepSeek seems to suggest that this only includes the cost for the most recent version and none of the development that preceded it.The DeepSeek AI assistant recently became the No.1 downloaded free app on the Apple Store.

As resources become more scarce, the focus will inevitably turn toward innovation, breeding the next generation of advancements.Even if this represents a breakthrough in AI development, it likely won’t reduce the need for Nvidia’s state-of-the-art processors, as they will continue to play a crucial role in training AI models.The group generally agreed that Nvidia’s premium valuation would lead to increased volatility, which would test the mettle of investors.Collectively, the evidence suggests that DeepSeek’s bombshell was more of an inevitable evolution of technology than a major breakthrough.It’s still the early days of the AI revolution, and as such, investors should expect more “bombshell” developments in the field in the months and years to come. Some investors were scared out of Nvidia on Monday, but having a knee-jerk reaction to news like this could be a costly mistake.Data by YChartsFinally, Nvidia stock is currently selling for roughly 50 times earnings. While that might be enough to send value investors headed for the exits, that’s far below Nvidia’s average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 81 over the past five years, making it relatively inexpensive from a historical perspective. Furthermore, the stock gained more than 2,000% during that same period, which illustrates why it is worthy of a premium.Given the company’s long track record and history of innovation, I still believe Nvidia is a worthwhile investment. One of the biggest beneficiaries of these secular tailwinds has been Nvidia (NVDA 8.93%). The company’s graphic processing units (GPUs), which were initially developed for gaming applications, proved equally adept at supplying the computational horsepower needed for AI. Robust sales of these processors fueled a parabolic rise, sending Nvidia stock up more than 500% over the past two years.However, claims made by Chinese start-up DeepSeek threatened to upset the existing paradigm, sending Nvidia into a tailspin. The stock slumped 17% and lost nearly $600 billion in market cap in a single day. Nevertheless, after a good night’s sleep, Wall Street has some thoughts on the matter.Perspective is requiredEdgar Allan Poe famously wrote, “Believe nothing you hear, and only one half that you see.” Wall Street seems to be taking that approach, to a certain extent, regarding some of the assertions made by DeepSeek. Specifically, claims that it created its chatbot for $5.6 million are being met with skepticism by some analysts.Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note to clients (emphasis mine), “Did DeepSeek really ‘build OpenAI for $5M?’ Of course not.” The analyst suggested that many of the routine expenses and development costs were left out of the total. “DeepSeek’s R1 paper did not quantify the additional resources that were required to develop the R1 model (presumably they were substantial as well),” he wrote.Many investors panicked on Monday, fearing that more efficient AI models would mean less business for Nvidia, but that’s likely not the case. According to Jevons paradox, efficiency gains from technological advancements generally increase demand by bringing costs down. Put another way, lower-cost AI models will drive increased adoption, which will increase demand for Nvidia’s AI-centric processors.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse took a similar position: “Innovation is driving down cost of adoption and making AI ubiquitous,” he wrote. “We see this progress as positive in the need for more and more compute over time (not less).” This bodes well for Nvidia.Tigress Financial upgraded Nvidia to strong buy on Tuesday and increased its price target on the stock to a Street-high $220.

Given Deep Six is based on pirated nvidia chips…… MSN Money: “There is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases, and that is Nvidia,” said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. Bernstein has reiterated its outperform ratings on Nvidia, with a $175 price target, and Broadcom, with a $220 target, saying it continues to like those names within the U.S. semiconductor sector.” CCP: Chinese Communist Party actually means Cut, Copy, Paste. My personal take... After the initial shake-out, more voices calling for temperance rose to the surface. While it is entirely possible that a more efficient model could lead to weakening demand for Nvidia’s chips, it is far from a guarantee. In fact, it could have the opposite effect: It could lead to increased demand. There is a concept in economics dubbed the Jevons Paradox that may apply here — that is, increased efficiency in a market leads to more demand, not less. If DeepSeek’s model leads to AI models in general taking a leap forward in efficiency, I believe that AI applications will become more useful and ubiquitous, and thus demand will increase. We will see how this pans out, but the initial panic has subsided, and today saw Nvidia’s stock recover somewhat. My personal take...

A fool and his money are some party... and the AI hawkers are partying all the way to their Cayman Island accounts. I suspect the Nvidia chips are too expensive and too power hungry for consumer use. They’re probably too capable for widespread military use. They’re great chips, but their market may not be as large as hoped for. Be aware, I’m not a great investor. My mom with an eighth-grade education was a great investor. “Technology stocks were rocked to their core” NVDA still up 100% in a year. 2,000% in five years. Qwen, also known as Tongyi Qianwen (通义千问), is a family of large language models developed by Alibaba. The latest version, Qwen 2.5, has been making headlines for its impressive performance. Alibaba claims that Qwen 2.5 outperforms other leading AI models, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, DeepSeek’s V3, and Meta’s Llama 3.1. Copilot: Qwen Every country in the world is going to require millions of them for data centres that are currently being planned or under construction. The market for NVIDIA chips is going to be strong for a long time to come. “I suspect the Nvidia chips are too expensive and too power hungry for consumer use. They’re probably too capable for widespread military use.” Nvidia has consumer GPU chips. Here is a gaming PC for $849. https://www.bestbuy.com/site/cyberpowerpc-gamer-master-gaming-desktop-amd-ryzen-5-5500-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-8gb-1tb-ssd-black/6575120.p?skuId=6575120 Then there are their “AI” processors which are used to train AI programs. Go figure. ChiComms lied. Their spyware is a house of cards. Yes, I saw that too, thanks. The Tech Space is always crackling with energy, and much of it is reciprocal. More importantly... What did Nancy Pelosi do? New technology disrupts but that is how new growth curves are created. Sometimes disruptive technologies like AI get disrupted because that’s where the focus of innovation is. Some like Apple have often done to themselves because they are already thinking at least one generation ahead. The timing may be a surprise but as one who is long on NVDA. I will be interested in how they respond over the next few quarters. And Nvidia is more than a chip company. They are a software and network company. As an example, they have more software engineers than hardware. Their CUDA environment leads the AI deployment systems. It compiles a number of languages for AI use on their chips. Their purchase of Mellanox gave them the fast network technology for data centers. I bought NVDA Monday and yesterday. There’s nothing about DeepSeek that indicates the need for Nvidia’s GPUs is going to decline. And I don’t need the money short-term.

William Dudley, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Chris LaCivita, a political consultant and co-manager of Trump’s 2024 campaign, are joining Coinbase’s global advisory council, the company said in a press release. Kyrsten Sinema, a former Democratic Arizona senator—who once proposed eliminating taxes on crypto transactions under $50—will also be joining the council, Coinbase said. What’s more, Allen & Co. Managing Director Luis Alberto Moreno, who serves on the Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum (WEF), will round out the group, Coinbase added. Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad told Decrypt in a statement that the four new members represent “some of the brightest minds across finance, tech, and politics,” who will help guide Coinbase’s direction as “the world enters a new era for crypto.” Under the Biden administration, Coinbase faced heavy scrutiny from the SEC, which alleged that America’s leading crypto exchange violated agency rules in a now-frozen lawsuit. With Trump’s SEC apparently taking a crypto-friendlier bent with plans to bring about a sense of regulatory clarity, it appears Coinbase is taking on power players to advance its vision. “I believe we’ve reached a pivotal moment in crypto’s evolution,” Dudley, the former Fed policymaker, said in a statement. “Coinbase can ensure it is integrated into our financial system in a safe and beneficial way for Americans.” In 2018, as president of the New York Fed, Dudley warned that the “speculative mania around cryptocurrencies” was dangerous because of his perceived lack of underlying value, per the Wall Street Journal. While Bitcoin’s beginnings are rooted in a skepticism of the existing financial system—Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, embedded a message referencing bank bailouts in Bitcoin’s first block—Coinbase has embraced the industry’s ascent into the mainstream, working with companies who view blockchain as a natural evolution of financial markets. Coinbase first inked a partnership with BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, in 2022. While BlackRock CEO Larry Fink continues to promote Bitcoin, he’s also talked extensively about the benefits associated with the tokenization of securities. Following a recent trip to Davos, where the WEF holds its annual meeting, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a post on X that the exchange will work with corporate leaders, from banks to asset managers, as investments accelerate into crypto. “We need crypto to update the entire global financial system to bring these benefits to everyone,” he wrote. "They need an institutional-grade partner like Coinbase, who can build relentlessly through the winters, to feel confident getting into crypto.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Marketers Say They Are Ready To Move Beyond Google Search

Time Published: 2025-01-29T17:20:35Z

Plus: UnitedMasters Brings Musicians Into The Creator Economy, CNN Layoffs Show Problems In Broadcasting, AI-Generated Media Dazzles And Baffles Search is changing and marketers say they’re ready for it. A new study from Botify found that 94% of marketing leaders say they are at least somewhat prepared to optimize brand visibility for AI search, with almost 42% saying they’re very prepared. Not only are they prepared, but they’re enthusiastic, too. Nearly two-thirds were excited by Gartner’s prediction that AI chatbots will cause a 25% drop in traditional search engine traffic by 2026, and 74% were excited by what they’ve seen so far with ChatGPT Search. While the study shows that marketers are welcoming the challenge of moving away from Google’s long dominance in basic online search, how they’re getting ready is different across the board. More than six in 10 said they’re adjusting their strategies, but what they’re adjusting for varies. The survey asked marketers what they think of when someone mentions non-Google search, and while OpenAI products got high marks—56% think of ChatGPT and 42% think of SearchGPT—many are thinking more along the lines of traditional social channels. YouTube was the most popular alternative, with just over two-thirds thinking of it, but Meta and TikTok were each considered by about 40% of respondents. (The study was conducted in December, before the TikTok ban-or-sale law was upheld or enacted.) Nearly 45% thought about e-commerce giant Amazon. While marketers have been working on their social media and e-commerce search strategies for years, there’s a steep learning curve in figuring out just what to do for generative AI marketing plans. Just over half—55%—say understanding how platforms work is a major challenge. About the same amount said they’re concerned about data privacy. And nearly half are worried about how to keep up with the pace of innovation. The good news for marketers is that there’s a lot in flux with generative AI search. Tools are being refined, algorithms are changing, systems are “learning” better answers, and different types of information are being prioritized. It’s a good time for marketers to experiment and try new things to see what works, especially since generative AI platforms are doing the same thing. And the fact that most marketers see this as an opportunity means that creative solutions are likely to come from all areas, with potential for unexpected and positive results. Technology has been changing the way things work for years. It’s had huge impacts on creators, democratizing the ability for people to create something, put it out into the world and have it make a difference. Legendary record industry executive Steve Stoute saw opportunities in technology, and harnessed its opportunity for the music industry by starting UnitedMasters in 2017. I talked to him about how UnitedMasters is augmenting the creator economy, and an excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. The CNN logo outside its Atlanta studios. Another sign of the times for traditional broadcast media: Last week, CNN cut about 6% of its workforce—about 200 employees, mainly on the broadcast side—but continued hiring for digital media jobs. Forbes senior contributor David Bloom writes the cuts shouldn’t have been a surprise. CNN has been losing viewership as many people change the way they look for and consume news. Benzinga reports that since the election in November, CNN has lost 47% of its primetime viewers, hitting a 30-year ratings low for the network. When the cuts were announced, CNN CEO Mark Thompson said the network will soon launch a streaming service, revamp its digital footprint and subscriber services and make changes to its lineup—and the total headcount at the news organization should be about the same when all is done. Bloom writes that Thompson has been working for about a year to figure out how to remake CNN for today’s viewer. Many other legacy networks that have seen the same types of issues—especially MSNBC and ABC News—are likely to be paying close attention. An image from László Gaál's video. A new, “speculative” commercial featuring Porsche from digital artist László Gaál is attracting a lot of attention. It tells the story of the Italian Pisano family, which has long been known in their small village for having extremely flexible necks. The reason: A neighbor of their ancestral home who loves sports cars regularly drives the latest Porsche models past the Pisanos’ balcony. The detailed story, which includes a variety of locations, a large cast and innovative camera shots, isn’t the attention-grabbing part. The entire commercial—including the vast majority of the “How I made this” behind-the-scenes interview with Gaál at the end—was AI-generated, writes Forbes contributor Roger Dooley. Gaál used Veo2 from Google DeepMind, which is still in experimental mode, to create everything except the scenes when he personally is on camera, spinning a tale of the locations, cast and crew needed for the commercial. Unlike the somewhat clunky and not-always-logical AI-generated Coca-Cola holiday commercials last year, this commercial is widely praised for its realistic feel. On a Reddit thread, Gaál said the entire commercial took about three weeks to make. The video has several disclaimers throughout that indicate it was made almost entirely by AI (and was also not actually created in conjunction with Porsche). But more obscure, low tech AI creations—known as AI slop—are increasingly proliferating on social media, often without anything to tell viewers that the images aren’t real. On Facebook, some users post over-the-top AI-generated images, sometimes daring people to believe them. They’re widely believed and accepted as real. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg “loved” a viral AI-generated photo last week of a baker who created an intricate loaf of challah bread shaped like an actual-size horse, Forbes senior contributor Dani Di Placido writes. The photo was originally posted on a Polish satire site, and has been widely shared to show the baker’s “feat”—despite the fact that designing and baking a complex loaf of bread that size that looks so good is a nearly impossible task. And Di Placido writes Zuckerberg’s reaction could just be recognizing a well-made AI-generated image. The header photo on the centibillionaire’s own Facebook page is an AI-generated one of llamas standing on and around computer servers. UnitedMasters founder and CEO Steve Stoute, and the "UnitedMasters: A Celebration Of Independence" event at the 65th Grammy Awards. With a career in the music business that started in the 1990s, Steve Stoute has long been a key leader in the space. He served as an executive at Sony Music and Interscope Geffen A&M, then started advertising agency Translation. In 2017, he started UnitedMasters, a technology-driven company that lets artists develop music, get licensing and promotion and reach brand partnerships without going through the traditional record label process. UnitedMasters is valued at $550 million, and its investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Alphabet and 20th Century Fox. I talked to Stoute about why his business model—and the creator economy as a whole—is thriving. This conversation contains expletives, and has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. 2024 was an incredible year for UnitedMasters, especially with UnitedMasters artist FloyyMenor having the global No. 1 song on TikTok, “Gata Only.” What did you see proven with your business model last year? Stoute: When we first did this, I knew that [it would help] the mid-to-long tail artists, who probably would’ve never gotten a record deal because they couldn’t get to New York or LA, to the cities where record deals were given out, or because they took longer to develop. They would not necessarily get a deal. If we were able to give them a home, they would be able to earn a living by doing what they love. It’s being able to earn a living with doing something you love. That, I think, [is] what makes the world a better place, so that’s what I was focused on. All of a sudden, it wasn’t just for the mid-to-long tail. The big frontline artists wanted independence. They wanted to own their masses. They wanted to get the economics in their favor. And with FloyyMenor from Chile, he didn't have to go to Miami or LA or New York to get a record deal. He uploaded the song from his home and had the No. 1 TikTok song of the year, the No. 6 Spotify song of the year, a top 10 Apple Music song of the year. What that means is we’re happy. That’s another artist who got a chance to maximize their economics because of our platform. No. 2, what it shows is that the metric that the big guys use to justify success, we’re doing that too. We weren’t ever in the game that had the No. 1 TikTok song of the year. We were here to give people a platform and allow them the opportunity to do what they love and earn a living. It’s like if somebody's writing on Substack and then they’re the No. 1 published author in the New York Times. They didn’t build Substack for that. They built it for people to make a living. But if it hits that metric, then all of a sudden Penguin and all the big guys go, wait a minute. They’re playing in my game. How does the creator economy play into your business? I felt like musicians were left out of the creator economy because everyone thought the labels were handling that. The creator economy was really focused on gamers and makeup bloggers and vloggers and things like that. The music people had this thing called a record company. So that was that. The artists that did not have record deals were like: We are part of the creator economy. I think SoundCloud benefited from that. Early on, SoundCloud harbored the creator economy musicians, and then they wanted more. They didn’t want to just be on SoundCloud. They wanted distribution and opportunities. When I built UnitedMasters, I was building it not only to provide artist distribution, but we had Translation. We worked with the NBA and State Farm and AT&T and Meta, to name a few. We can not only distribute these artists, but we can do deals for them with some of these brands. The combination of being able to go to one place and get your music distributed, plus have access to brands for larger opportunities was the ecosystem I thought and I know, and is proving to be what a music company should look like going forward. From what you see, what is in store for 2025 for the creator economy as a whole? Outside of live sports, that’s where brands want to put their money. You have NFL, NBA, hockey, WNBA, and then you have the creator economy. You have podcasters and bloggers and streamers and musicians, and you’re like, how can I ring-fence that so I could measure the results within that infrastructure, and how can I protect brand safety in doing that? Brands are saying, I’m all-in for that. What the creator economy has to do is get brand ready: My shit’s together, it’s brand-friendly, it’s measurable. You can rely on us. Now you’re talking about a new medium that has money rushing towards it, that they didn’t expect to happen so fast so soon. They have to get leveled up.

Title: Everything You Need To Use PlayStation VR2 On PC
URL: https://kotaku.com/psvr2-pc-adapter-bluetooth-connection-displayport-1851750509
Time Published: 2025-01-29T17:00:00Z
Full Content:
The PlayStation VR2 Headset didn’t light the world on fire when it originally released in 2023, but its user base has grown despite a lackluster launch. Plus, the headset itself features some pretty impressive VR hardware. Following a substantial $200 discount in 2024, many PlayStation 5 owners got to enjoy Beatsaber and Resident Evil 4 in first-person for the relatively more affordable price of $349.99. What’s more, Sony has since released a PC Adapter for the VR2, which provides access to the thousands of VR games available on Steam and a new option for VR gamers on PC. What’s not to love? While it’s very cool that PlayStation VR2 works on PC, it does have a few big caveats. Not only do you need the headset (which retains its $549.99 MSRP as of writing), you’ll need a computer powerful enough to handle VR gaming. You can view the PC requirements to use the VR2 here, but the TLDR is that you’ll need a relatively powerful graphics card that has a spare DisplayPort for you to use. That last part is perhaps most important: You need to have a monitor and your PSVR2 headset plugged in at the same time. The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 came out in 2019 and is listed as a minimum requirement, though Sony recommends either a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or later for “best performance.” You’ll also have to buy the correct peripherals to make it work, since the PlayStation VR2 box isn’t going to give you everything you need out of the box. If these obstacles seem surmountable and you’re determined to see your PlayStation Headset and your PC work together in gaming harmony, here’s everything you’ll need to get it up and running. The lynchpin of this whole operation is the $59.99 PlayStation VR2 PC Adapter, which Sony released on August 7, 2024. Unfortunately, as of writing, this gadget has been habitually out of stock. Sony’s own website doesn’t have any available for purchase (though I hope they do by the time you read this), and you’ll be lucky to find used adapters at retailers like Best Buy and GameStop. This environment has let third parties pop up with off-brand PlayStation VR2 PC Adapters, which are riskier to use. Amazon reviews indicate that these either work poorly or don’t run at all, so an official Sony Adapter remains ideal despite its scarcity. Make sure you’re purchasing from an official storefront (check for the PlayStation Store mention on Amazon), and look for the PlayStation logo on the adapter itself. In a perfect world, the VR2 Headset and adapter would give you everything you need to get into PC VR gaming. Unfortunately, you still might have to spend some extra cash. The first thing you’ll need is a spare DisplayPort cable to connect your adapter to your graphics card. Yes, you do need to have your monitor and headset connected at the same time, so this isn’t a corner you can reasonably cut. The second thing you might need is a supported Bluetooth dongle. We’ll get into this below, but some PSVR2 Adapter owners have reported needing one of the Bluetooth dongles recommended by Sony to get the smoothest performance possible. This will probably cost you about $20, though you can find lower prices if you shop at the right time. Combined with the headset, this means you’ll need to spend between $60 and $90 in total to get your PlayStation VR2 headset to work on your computer. That’s much cheaper than buying a new headset just for your PC, but you’ll have to decide if that’s a price you’re willing to pay before you even drop cash on Half-Life Alyx. Once you have all the necessary components together, plug your adaptor into a power outlet and use your DisplayPort cable to plug the adaptor into your computer’s GPU (make sure you use the right slot!). Plug your headset into the adaptor, turn it on, and then open up Steam. Next, find and download both the PlayStation VR2 app and Steam VR. Open the PlayStation VR2 App, and it’ll take you through instructions for connecting your controllers via Bluetooth. Follow the instructions, and then open the Steam VR app. If done correctly, you should see a window that looks like this when you hover your mouse over Steam VR on your taskbar. In my testing, it doesn’t seem like you need to launch the PlayStation VR2 app every time you want to use Steam VR after the initial setup. Make sure you turn on your headset whenever you want to use it, otherwise Steam won’t recognize either the device or the accompanying controllers. Depending on your setup, you may run into a wall trying to get your VR controllers and your PC to get along. While frustrating, there are a few common culprits that lead to this issue. The first is that your motherboard in your computer may be missing a Wi-Fi antenna, which will weaken both your system’s Wi-Fi connection and its bandwidth for Bluetooth devices. If your PC came with an antenna that you just never screwed in, I strongly recommend setting that up. You’ll get a stronger wifi connection too! The second common culprit is… well, computers are weird. Your controllers may not even show up in your Bluetooth menu because, I don’t know, your hardware is in a bad mood I guess? In this scenario, restart your computer and give the connection process another shot. If your back is really against the wall and you just want to use your headset, I did find that plugging each controller directly into my computer works. This of course relies on you having two USB-A to USB-C cords hanging around, but if you own a PS5 and PSVR2 headset, you should have two to work with. I’d only label this a temporary fix, as all the wires will make any game with motion controls cumbersome at best and dangerous at worst. But for games that only require basic pointing and shooting, this setup can work. If you have any persistent connection issues, or the controllers just aren’t responsive enough, I recommend looking into one of those Sony approved dongles. The adapter probably should have come with one of these to save you the headache, but them’s the breaks. It’s certainly inconvenient to have to spend extra money on accessories to get this headset to work, and the Bluetooth connection issues can become a hassle if you’re not one who likes to tinker. But after jumping through the initial hurdles, I found PlayStation VR2 works pretty well on PC. It’s relatively easy to pick up and play, and the OLED screen looks great, too. Steam reviews indicate that some folks deal with software crashing and other glitches while using it, and you should be aware that those reports exist. That said, that hasn’t been my experience so far. Despite a good experience when it’s all up and running, I wouldn’t recommend investing in PlayStation VR2 if your primary use case is PC VR gaming. If nothing else, the PlayStation VR2’s relative scarcity means its less supported than more widely-adopted alternatives like the Meta Quest, so there’s no guarantee that future games will be made with the PlayStation headset in mind. Additionally, some of the neatest features of the headset—such as eye tracking and HDR—aren’t supported by the PC adapter. But as long as you know all that going in, the PC adapter does its job and gives you access to Steam’s robust ecosystem of VR games. Let’s just hope that Sony actually makes more of these things so you can actually purchase one! .

Title: Czech Central Bank To Vote On €7 Billion Bitcoin Investment On Thursday
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/czech-central-bank-vote-7-billion-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T16:30:13Z
Full Content:
The Czech National Bank (CNB) is poised to decide on Thursday whether to allocate up to 5% of its €140 billion in foreign exchange reserves to Bitcoin, an amount totaling roughly €7 billion (roughly $7.31 billion). Governor Aleš Michl revealed the plan in an exclusive interview with the Financial Times, underlining a bold departure from the traditional asset strategies usually favored by major central banks. Michl, who previously worked as an investment fund manager, expressed his conviction that introducing BTC into the CNB’s portfolio could serve as a viable way to diversify holdings. “For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good,” he told the FT. He acknowledged the cryptocurrency’s “extreme volatility” and limited track record but pointed to rising institutional interest since global asset managers like BlackRock launched Bitcoin exchange-traded funds last year. Should the board approve the plan, the CNB could direct as much as 5% of its reserves—equivalent to approximately €7 billion—into Bitcoin. “Five percent [of our assets] is a lot of money, even for the Bitcoin market,” Michl noted, underscoring the potential impact of a sizable BTC purchase by a sovereign authority. Most central banks around the world have steered clear of BTC, preferring “safer” instruments such as highly rated government bonds. A few have ventured into equities, but public disclosures of Bitcoin holdings by these institutions (except for El Salvador) remain virtually nonexistent. Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell confirmed in December that the US central bank does not hold Bitcoin, while comparing it to gold, describing it as a virtual and digital speculative asset. Other top monetary officials in Europe have been notoriously critical. The governor of the Bundesbank, Joachim Nagel, likened Bitcoin to “digital tulips,” referencing the 17th-century speculative bubble. European Central Bank (ECB) officials have similarly argued that the “fair value of Bitcoin is still zero.” However, Michl struck a distinctly different tone. “I used to run an investment fund, so I’m a typical investment banker, I would say, I like profitability,” he told the FT. He also suggested more central banks might follow suit within the next five years, citing how some pension funds and commercial banks have begun holding BTC in their portfolios. Michl acknowledges the gamble: “It’s possible to have a big range of outcomes, that Bitcoin will have a value of zero or an absolutely fantastic value.” Yet he also drew attention to the historical examples of failed corporate investments, such as Enron and Wirecard, arguing that underperformance is an inherent risk of portfolio management. Internal CNB calculations suggest that if the central bank had held 5% of its foreign reserves in BTC over the past decade, its annual returns would have increased by 3.5%—albeit with double the volatility. “But I’m saying that my goal is to diversify the portfolio, so if Bitcoin is good [for that], then let’s have it,” Michl remarked. In the interview, Michl referenced US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance and the growing influence of Bitcoin-focused executives in Washington. Last week, Trump issued an executive order to explore the creation of a national digital asset stockpile, fueling further discussions about crypto at the highest levels of government. While the Bitcoin proposal has captured headlines, the CNB already stands out for its relatively adventurous investment policy; 22% of its foreign exchange reserves are in equities—well above the norm for a central bank. Michl intends to increase US stock holdings to 50% of that equity portfolio within three years, up from the current 30%. “We are buying gradually and in very small steps because the [US stock] prices are the highest in history,” he explained. Whether the CNB board ultimately endorses Michl’s proposal to venture into BTC remains to be seen. If approved, the Czech National Bank could become the first major Western central bank to publicly hold crypto, setting a precedent that might inspire others—or serve as a cautionary tale. The CNB’s board meeting is scheduled for Thursday, with a final vote on the governor’s Bitcoin proposal expected shortly thereafter. At press time, BTC traded at $102,817.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Jan. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Alibaba releases AI model to challenge DeepSeek days after market sell-off
URL: https://qz.com/alibaba-qwen-ai-model-deepseek-r1-v3-meta-llama-china-1851750340
Time Published: 2025-01-29T15:52:00Z

Days after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a global tech stock sell-off, a homegrown rival said its new AI model performed even better. Alibaba Cloud (BABA+5.73%) released an upgraded version of its flagship AI model, Qwen2.5-Max, that performed better than top open-source competitors, including DeepSeek’s V3 model and Meta’s (META+1.62%) Llama 3.1 model on various benchmarks, according to results published by the firm on WeChat. The cloud computing subsidiary of Alibaba Group also found its Qwen2.5-Max showed comparable performance to OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet — both closed-source models. The Chinese firm said its AI model “has demonstrated world-leading model performance in mainstream authoritative benchmarks,” including the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU), which evaluates general knowledge, and LiveCodeBench, which tests coding skills. The Qwen2.5-Max announcement follows DeepSeek’s launch of its first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, last week, which demonstrated comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models, O1-mini and O1, on several industry benchmarks, according to its technical paper. The release of DeepSeek-R1 prompted Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P 500 futures to fall Monday morning. Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.25%) shares plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. Investors were spooked by the DeepSeek-R1 launch, which comes after the December release of DeepSeek-V3. While Alibaba Cloud hasn’t disclosed its development costs, DeepSeek’s claim that it built its model for just $5.6 million using Nvidia’s reduced-capability graphics processing units has caught the market’s attention, challenging assumptions about the massive investments needed for AI development. According to the technical paper, DeepSeek used a cluster of just under 2,050 Nvidia H800 chips for training its V3 model — a less powerful version of the chipmaker’s H100 that it is allowed to sell to Chinese firms under U.S. chip restrictions. The cluster is also much smaller than the tens of thousands of chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. DeepSeek’s release has called Big Tech’s tens of billions in spending on AI into question ahead of a slate of earnings results, as well as the effectiveness of U.S. efforts to curb advanced chips from entering the country.

Title: The paradox at the heart of the AI debate

Time Published: 2025-01-29T15:50:24Z

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/29/2025 7:50:24 AM PST by Red Badger Investors in energy stocks panicked this week over the release of a new, cheaper AI model, ignoring an argument that reducing the energy needs of such models could actually increase demand for energy overall. Why it matters: The news could end up being bullish for those stocks, which lost more than $40 billion in value on Monday. How it works: The Jevons Paradox, as first formulated in 1865 by English economist William Stanley Jevons, states that greater efficiency in the use of any given resource can result in increased demand for that resource. His example was coal: After the Watt steam engine was introduced — which burned much less coal than its predecessors — demand for coal rose substantially, as Watt's engines were built into a wide range of applications. What they're saying: "This positive supply shock will massively increase demand for AI compute and applications of all sorts," says Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University. Morgan Stanley energy analysts concurred in a note Tuesday, saying "there are multiple indications" the Jevons Paradox applies to the cost of compute in AI applications. Between the lines: The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7.

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

How it works: The Jevons Paradox, as first formulated in 1865 by English economist William Stanley Jevons, states that greater efficiency in the use of any given resource can result in increased demand for that resource. His example was coal: After the Watt steam engine was introduced — which burned much less coal than its predecessors — demand for coal rose substantially, as Watt's engines were built into a wide range of applications. What they're saying: "This positive supply shock will massively increase demand for AI compute and applications of all sorts," says Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University. Morgan Stanley energy analysts concurred in a note Tuesday, saying "there are multiple indications" the Jevons Paradox applies to the cost of compute in AI applications. Between the lines: The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7. The bottom line: Between electric vehicles and the seemingly bottomless thirst from data centers for electricity, don't hold your breath waiting for demand to fall.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson How it works: The Jevons Paradox, as first formulated in 1865 by English economist William Stanley Jevons, states that greater efficiency in the use of any given resource can result in increased demand for that resource. His example was coal: After the Watt steam engine was introduced — which burned much less coal than its predecessors — demand for coal rose substantially, as Watt's engines were built into a wide range of applications. What they're saying: "This positive supply shock will massively increase demand for AI compute and applications of all sorts," says Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University. Morgan Stanley energy analysts concurred in a note Tuesday, saying "there are multiple indications" the Jevons Paradox applies to the cost of compute in AI applications. Between the lines: The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7. The bottom line: Between electric vehicles and the seemingly bottomless thirst from data centers for electricity, don't hold your breath waiting for demand to fall.

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

What they're saying: "This positive supply shock will massively increase demand for AI compute and applications of all sorts," says Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University. Morgan Stanley energy analysts concurred in a note Tuesday, saying "there are multiple indications" the Jevons Paradox applies to the cost of compute in AI applications. Between the lines: The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7. The bottom line: Between electric vehicles and the seemingly bottomless thirst from data centers for electricity, don't hold your breath waiting for demand to fall.

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

Between the lines: The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7. The bottom line: Between electric vehicles and the seemingly bottomless thirst from data centers for electricity, don't hold your breath waiting for demand to fall.

Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

Title: Institutions Are Primed for MicroStrategy's Preferred Stock Sale, Say Analysts

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR). To say that MicroStrategy (MSTR) has been at the lead of creatively raising capital with which to buy massive amounts of bitcoin (BTC) would be an understatement. Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the company this week opened a new front along those lines with its perpetual preferred stock offering (STRK). Preferred stock sits between equity and debt on the corporate balance sheet, offering investors the regular return of bonds while giving them an ownership stake in a company. Well-followed MicroStrategy analyst Ben Werkman, posted on X about the attraction preferred stock can offer institutional investors due to its lack of maturity risk, stable yield and optional equity upside. "I could see a scenario where [the preferred stock] starts taking some of the convertible bond space for fixed income accumulation due to the lack of any point in time maturity risk," said Werkman. "Preferred stock has the potential to be massively more accretive than any convertible offering has been and definitely more accretive than [share sales]." Similar sentiments came via Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Investments, who called MSTR's preferred stock offering one of the most compelling securities in the market and a next-generation investment vehicle. "STRK is a near-perfect instrument," wrote Park. "It gives you two chances to win: First, when rates go down, it's a huge boon to the principal, and two, if MicroStrategy goes up first, then you have a deep in-the-money (ITM) option to convert and own the higher volatility asset or just directly sell." The largest of the U.S. preferred stock ETFs is the BlackRock iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (PFF), which has roughly $15 billion in assets under management. The largest holders of PFF ETF are major corporations such as Boeing (BA), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citi Group (C). The final pricing terms of the new security are to be completed and announced after the market closes on Thursday.

Title: Saga sets sail with £450m HPS refinancing boost

Saga, the financial services and travel provider to the over-50s, is tapping one of the world's biggest investment firms as part of a refinancing aimed at relieving pressure on its balance sheet. Sky News has learnt that London-listed Saga is lining up HPS - which is in the process of being taken over by the asset management behemoth BlackRock - to help refinance more than £450m of its existing debt. Financiers said an agreement was likely to be announced alongside a scheduled trading update from the company on Thursday morning. Money latest: People who only watch Netflix or Disney 'may have to pay BBC licence fee' The debt involved in the deal comprises a bond, a loan from chairman Sir Roger De Haan and Saga's revolving credit facility. A refinancing will be a boost to Saga, which has been weighed down by a debt pile which is huge relative to the value of its equity. It will come months after the company struck a partnership deal with the Belgian insurer Ageas, which involves a series of cash payments to the British business. In February last year, it also held talks with Open, an Australian company, about a sale of the division but the discussions fell apart. Saga has previously signalled that it would explore a similar partnership model for its cruises division, although a transaction is not thought to be imminent. Shares in Saga have fallen by just over 20% during the last 12 months, leaving it with a market capitalisation of about £165m.

Saga, the financial services and travel provider for over-50s, has said it expects to report an underlying profit before tax above previous guidance.

Title: Czech National Bank Plans Multi-Billion Euro Bitcoin Purchase
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2025/czech-national-bank-plans-multi-billion-euro-bitcoin-purchase/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T15:06:48Z
Full Content:
The governor of the Czech National Bank reportedly wants to invest in bitcoin. The move — involving billions of euros worth of the country’s reserves — could make this the first central bank in a Western nation to hold cryptocurrency assets, the Financial Times (FT) reported Wednesday (Jan. 29). Governor Aleš Michl said in an interview with the FT that he would present the bank’s board with the idea of investing in bitcoin as a way of diversifying the CNB’s reserves at a Thursday (Jan. 30) meeting. If the board agrees, the bank could someday hold up to 5% of its 140 billion euros of reserves in bitcoin, said Michl. Although he acknowledged bitcoin’s “extreme volatility” and limited record, Michl stressed growing investor interest in bitcoin since BlackRock and other companies launched bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) in 2024. He also noted President Donald Trump’s push to deregulate the crypto sector and the administration’s embrace of the industry. Trump last week issued an executive order that established a working group to study the creation of a national digital asset stockpile. “For the diversification of our assets, bitcoin seems good,” Michl told the FT. “Those [Trump] guys can now kind of create some bubble for bitcoin, but I think the trend would be an increase without those guys as well, because it’s an alternative [investment] for more people.” The report points out that central banks have typically placed reserves in more conservative assets — U.S. Treasuries, bonds, equities — though none have publicly adopted crypto. Michl said he had “a totally different philosophy” about bitcoin compared to other central bank heads. “Of course, if you compare my position with other bankers, then I’m the one entering the jungle, or the pioneer,” Michl said. “I used to run an investment fund, so I’m a typical investment banker I would say, I like profitability.” While other central banks may be more reluctant to keep their reserves in bitcoin, they are — as covered here earlier this week — experimenting more frequently with blockchain and tokenization. At the most recent Eurogroup meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) offered an update on its exploration on tokenization and blockchain’s role in streamlining the wholesale settlement of transactions. The bank reported that the technology is capable of solving inefficiencies, reducing risks, and unlocking new opportunities within wholesale trade. “This maturation of the cross-border landscape could ultimately redefine how growth-focused treasurers and CFOs manage global transactions, liquidity and risk,” PYMNTS wrote. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Aleš Michl will present a proposal this Thursday that could see up to $7 billion of the country's wealth flow into crypto, potentially making it the first Western central bank to hold digital assets. "For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good," Michl said in an interview with the Financial Times, acknowledging his stance differs from other central bankers when it comes to crypto matters. The proposal follows increased institutional interest in Bitcoin after BlackRock and other firms launched spot ETFs. Michl also cited U.S. President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly stance and the growing influence of digital asset executives in his administration. This is not the first time that the country has made crypto headlines. In December, its parliament unanimously passed legislation exempting Bitcoin held over three years from capital gains tax. Earlier this month, Michl was quoted as saying that he had "considered" adopting Bitcoin as a foreign exchange reserve. Broader policy moves in the Eurozone are also shaping up in the background. No capital gains tax on bitcoin has just been passed in The Czech Republic with all members of the parliament voting for it 🇨🇿🔥 pic.twitter.com/i7E8aZHC2W — Kristian Csepcsar (@KristianCsep) December 6, 2024 Last week, the European Central Bank signaled its readiness for multiple rate cuts in 2025, with ECB President Christine Lagarde indicating a "gradual" approach toward monetary easing, according to reports from Reuters and CNBC out of Davos. Policymakers across Europe are slated to approve the cuts on January 30. The CNB has indeed carved out a niche in central banking with its investment strategies. Explaining its unique approach, Michl explained how the CNB's allocations are different from other central banks. Currently, the CNB allocates 22% of its portfolio to equities—primarily set on U.S. tech stocks like Apple and Microsoft. This is more than what most other central banks allocate, as they typically play it safe with government bonds. They're planning to ramp this up to 30% by 2029, betting on stocks to boost returns, Michl shared in the interview. Meanwhile, most central banks remain skeptical of crypto investments. The U.S. Federal Reserve confirmed in December it holds no Bitcoin, while European Central Bank officials maintained in February last year that the "fair value" of Bitcoin is "still zero," reacting to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs a month prior. Given these, Michl acknowledged potential risks, noting Bitcoin could end up worthless or achieve "absolutely fantastic value." Michl said the move is aimed at diversifying reserves rather than just speculating. “My goal is to diversify the portfolio, so if Bitcoin is good, then let’s have it,” he said. The bank did not immediately return Decrypt's request for comment. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: DeepSeek: Lemon, It’s Wednesday

It’s been another *checks notes* two days, so it’s time for all the latest DeepSeek news. You can also see my previous coverage of the r1 model and, from Monday various reactions including the Panic at the App Store. Before we get to new developments, I especially want to reiterate and emphasize the need to calm down about that $5.5 million ‘cost of training’ for v3. I wouldn’t quite agree with Palmer Lucky that ‘the $5m number is bogus’ and I wouldn’t call it a ‘Chinese psyop’ because I think we mostly did this to ourselves but it is very often being used in a highly bogus way – equating the direct compute cost of training v3 with the all-in cost of creating r1. Which is a very different number. DeepSeek is cracked, they cooked, and r1 is super impressive, but the $5.5 million v3 training cost: Altman handled his response to r1 with grace. OpenAI plans to ‘pull up some new releases.’ Meaning, oh, you want to race? I suppose I’ll go faster and take less precautions. Sam Altman: deepseek’s r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price. we will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. but mostly we are excited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission. the world is going to want to use a LOT of ai, and really be quite amazed by the next gen models coming. look forward to bringing you all AGI and beyond. It is very Galaxy Brain to say ‘this is perhaps good for OpenAI’ and presumably it very much is, but here’s a scenario. Ethan Mollick: DeepSeek is a really good model, but it is not generally a better model than o1 or Claude. But since it is both free & getting a ton of attention, I think a lot of people who were using free “mini” models are being exposed to what a early 2025 reasoner AI can do & are surprised I’m not saying that’s the baseline scenario, but I do expect the world to be quite amazed at the next generation of models, and they could now be more primed for that. Mark Chen (Chief Research Officer, OpenAI): Congrats to DeepSeek on producing an o1-level reasoning model! Their research paper demonstrates that they’ve independently found some of the core ideas that we did on our way to o1. However, I think the external response has been somewhat overblown, especially in narratives around cost. One implication of having two paradigms (pre-training and reasoning) is that we can optimize for a capability over two axes instead of one, which leads to lower costs. But it also means we have two axes along which we can scale, and we intend to push compute aggressively into both! As research in distillation matures, we’re also seeing that pushing on cost and pushing on capabilities are increasingly decoupled. The ability to serve at lower cost (especially at higher latency) doesn’t imply the ability to produce better capabilities. We will continue to improve our ability to serve models at lower cost, but we remain optimistic in our research roadmap, and will remain focused in executing on it. We’re excited to ship better models to you this quarter and over the year! Given the costs involved, and that you can scale to get better outputs, ‘serve faster and cheaper’ and ‘get better answers’ seem pretty linked, or are going to look rather similar. There is still a real and important difference between ‘I spend 10x as much compute to get 10x as many tokens to think with’ versus ‘I taught the model how to do longer CoT’ versus ‘I made the model smarter.’ Or at least I think there is. Should we now abandon all our plans to build gigantic data centers because DeepSeek showed we can run AI cheaper? No. Of course not. We’ll need more. Jevons Paradox and all that. Another question is compute governance. Does DeepSeek’s model prove that there’s no point in using compute thresholds for frontier model governance? My answer is no. DeepSeek did not mean the scaling laws stopped working. DeepSeek found new ways to scale and economize, and also to distill. But doing the same thing with more compute would have gotten better results, and indeed more compute is getting other labs better results if you don’t control for compute costs, and also they will now get to use these innovations themselves. Karen Hao: Much of the coverage has focused on U.S.-China tech competition. That misses a bigger story: DeepSeek has demonstrated that scaling up AI models relentlessly, a paradigm OpenAI introduced and champions, is not the only, and far from the best, way to develop AI. Yoavgo: This is trending in my feed, but I don’t get it. DeepSeek did not show that scale is not the way to go for AI (their base model is among the largest in parameter counts; their training data is huge, at 13 trillion tokens). They just scaled more efficiently. Thus far OpenAI & its peer scaling labs have sought to convince the public & policymakers that scaling is the best way to reach so-called AGI. This has always been more of an argument based in business than in science. Jon Stokes: Holy wow what do words even mean. What R1 does is a new type of scaling. It’s also GPU-intensive. In fact, the big mystery today in AI world is why NVIDIA dropped despite R1 demonstrating that GPUs are even more valuable than we thought they were. No part of this is coherent. Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): The real takeaway from DeepSeek is that with reasoning models you can achieve great performance with a small amount of compute. Now imagine what you can do with a large amount of compute. Noam Brown (OpenAI): Algorithmic breakthroughs and scaling are complementary, not in competition. The former bends the performance vs compute curve, while the latter moves further along the curve. Benjamin Todd: Deepseek hasn’t shown scaling doesn’t work. Take Deepseek’s techniques, apply 10x the compute, and you’ll get much better performance. And compute efficiency has always been part of the scaling paradigm. Ethan Mollick: The most unnerving part of the DeepSeek reaction online has been seeing folks take it as a sign that AI capability growth is not real. It signals the opposite, large improvements are possible, and is almost certain to kick off an acceleration in AI development through competition. I know a lot of people want AI to go away, but I am seeing so many interpretations of DeepSeek in ways that don’t really make sense, or misrepresent what they did. Dealing with the implications of AI, and trying to steer it towards positive use, is now more urgent, not less. Andrew Rettek: Deepseek means OPENAI just increased their effective compute by more than an OOM. OpenAI and Anthropic (in the forms of CEOs Sam Altman and Dario Amodei) have both expressed agreement on that since the release of r1, saying that they still believe the future involves very large and expensive training runs, including large amounts of compute on the RL step. David Sacks agreed as well, so the administration knows. One can think of all this as combining multiple distinct scaling laws. Mark Chen above talked about two axes but one could refer to at least four? Also you can extend to new modalities and use cases and so on. So essentially: Buckle up. Speaking of buckling up, nothing to see here, just a claimed 2x speed boost to r1, written by r1. Of course, that’s very different from r1 coming up with the idea. Aiden McLaughlin: switching to reasoners is like taking a sharp turn on a racetrack. everyone brakes to take the turn; for a moment, all cars look neck-and-neck when exiting the turn, small first-mover advantages compound. and ofc, some cars have enormous engines that eat up straight roads Dean Ball: I recommend trying not to overindex on the industry dynamics you’re observing now in light of the deepseek plot twist, or indeed of any particular plot twist. It’s a long game, and we’re riding a world-historical exponential. Things will change a lot, fast, again and again. It’s not that Jan is wrong, I’d be a lot more interested in paying for o1 pro if I had pdfs enabled, but… yeah. China Talk covers developments. The headline conclusion is that yes, compute very much will continue to be a key factor, everyone agrees on this. They note there is a potential budding DeepSeek partnership with ByteDance, which could unlock quite a lot of compute. Here was some shade: Founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng is the core person of DeepSeek. He is not the same type of person as Sam Altman. He is very knowledgeable about technology. Also important at least directionally: Pioneers vs. Chasers: ‘AI Progress Resembles a Step Function – Chasers Require 1/10th the Compute’ Fundamentally, DeepSeek was far more of an innovator than other Chinese AI companies, but it was still a chaser here, not a pioneer, except in compute efficiency, which is what chasers do best. If you want to maintain a lead and it’s much easier to follow than lead, well, time to get good and scale even more. Or you can realize you’re just feeding capability to the Chinese and break down crying and maybe keep your models for internal use, it’s an option. I found this odd: It’s odd because DeepSeek spent so little compute, and the efficiency gains pay for themselves in compute quite rapidly. And also the big companies are indeed releasing rapidly. Google and OpenAI are constantly shipping, even Anthropic ships. The idea of company focus seems more on point, and yes DeepSeek traded multimodality and other features for pure efficiency because they had to. Also note what they say later: As in, r1 is technically impressive as hell, and it definitely has its uses, but there’s a reason the existing models look like they do – the corners DeepSeek cut actually do matter for what people want. Of course DeepSeek will likely now turn to fixing such problems among other things and we’ll see how efficiently they can do that too. McKay Wrigley emphasizes the point that visible chain of thought (CoT) is a prompt debugger. It’s hard to go back to not seeing CoT after seeing CoT. Gallabytes reports that DeepSeek’s image model Janus Pro is a good first effort, but not good yet. Even if we were to ‘fully unlock’ all computing power in personal PCs for running AI, that would only increase available compute by ~10%, most compute is in data centers. We had a brief period where DeepSeek would serve you up r1 free and super fast. It turns out that’s not fully sustainable or at least needs time to scale as fast as demand rose, and you know how such folks feel about the ‘raise prices’ meme, Gallabytes: got used to r1 and now that it’s overloaded it’s hard to go back. @deepseek_ai please do something amazing and be the first LLM provider to offer surge pricing. the unofficial APIs are unusably slow. I too encountered slowness, and instantly it made me realize ‘yes the speed was a key part of why I loved this.’ DeItaone (January 27, 11:09am): DEEPSEEK SAYS SERVICE DEGRADED DUE TO ‘LARGE-SCALE MALICIOUS ATTACK’ Could be that. Could be too much demand and not enough supply. This will of course sort itself out in time, as long as you’re willing to pay, and it’s an open model so others can serve the model as well, but ‘everyone wants to use the shiny new model you are offering for free’ is going to run into obvious problems. Yes, of course one consideration is that if you use DeepSeek’s app it will collect all your data including device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address and so on and store it all in China. Did you for a second think otherwise? What you do with that info is on you. This doesn’t appear to rise to TikTok 2.0 levels of rendering your phone and data insecure, but let us say that ‘out of an abundance of caution’ I will be accessing the model through their website not the app thank you very much. Liv Boeree: tiktok round two, here we go. AI enthusiasts have the self control of an incontinent chihuahua. Typing Loudly: you can run it locally without an internet connection Liv Boeree: cool and what percentage of these incontinent chihuahuas will actually do this. I’m not going so far as to use third party providers for now, because I’m not feeding any sensitive data into the model, and DeepSeek’s implementation here is very nice and clean, so I’ve decided lazy is acceptable. I’m certainly not laying out ~$6,000 for a self-hosting rig, unless someone wants to buy one for me in the name of science. Note that if you’re looking for an alternative source, you want to ensure you’re not getting one of the smaller distillations, unless that is what you want. Janus is testing for steganography in r1, potentially looking for assistance. Janus also thinks Thebes theory here is likely to be true, that v3 was hurt by dividing into too many too small experts, but r1 lets them all dump their info into the CoT and collaborate, at least partially fixing this. Janus notes that r1 simply knows things and thinks about them, straight up, in response to Thebes speculating that all our chain of thought considerations have now put sufficient priming into the training data that CoT approaches work much better than they used to, which Prithviraj says is not the case, he says it’s about improved base models, which is the first obvious thought – the techniques work better off a stronger base, simple as that. Thebes: why did R1’s RL suddenly start working, when previous attempts to do similar things failed? theory: we’ve basically spent the last few years running a massive acausally distributed chain of thought data annotation program on the pretraining dataset. deepseek’s approach with R1 is a pretty obvious method. They are far from the first lab to try “slap a verifier on it and roll out CoTs.” But it didn’t used to work that well. … In the last couple of years, chains of thought have been posted all over the internet … Those CoTs in the V3 training set gave GRPO enough of a starting point to start converging, and furthermore, to generalize from verifiable domains to the non-verifiable ones using the bridge established by the pretraining data contamination. And now, R1’s visible chains of thought are going to lead to *another* massive enrichment of human-labeled reasoning on the internet, but on a far larger scale… The next round of base models post-R1 will be *even better* bases for reasoning models. in some possible worlds, this could also explain why OpenAI seemingly struggled so much with making their reasoning models in comparison. if they’re still using 4base or distils of it. Prithvraj: Simply, no. I’ve been looking at my old results from doing RL with “verifiable” rewards (math puzzle games, python code to pass unit tests) starting from 2019 with GPT-1/2 to 2024 with Qwen Math Deepseek’s success likely lies in the base models improving, the RL is constant Janus: This is an interesting hypothesis. DeepSeek R1 also just seems to have a much more lucid and high-resolution understanding of LLM ontology and history than any other model I’ve seen. (DeepSeek V3 did not seem to in my limited interactions with it, though.) I did not expect this on priors for a reasoner, but perhaps the main way that r1 seems smarter than any other LLM I’ve played with is the sheer lucidity and resolution of its world model—in particular, its knowledge of LLMs, both object- and meta-level, though this is also the main domain of knowledge I’ve engaged it in, and perhaps the only one I can evaluate at world-expert level. So, it may apply more generally. In effective fluid intelligence and attunement to real-time context, it actually feels weaker than, say, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. But when I talk to Sonnet about my ideas on LLMs, it feels like it is more naive than me, and it is figuring out a lot of things in context from “first principles.” When I talk to Opus about these things, it feels like it is understanding me by projecting the concepts onto more generic, resonant hyperobjects in its prior, meaning it is easy to get on the same page philosophically, but this tropological entanglement is not very precise. But with r1, it seems like it can simply reference the same concrete knowledge and ontology I have, much more like a peer. And it has intense opinions about these things. Wordgrammer thread on the DeepSeek technical breakthroughs. Here’s his conclusion, which seems rather overdetermined: Wordgrammer: “Is the US losing the war in AI??” I don’t think so. DeepSeek had a few big breakthroughs, we have had hundreds of small breakthroughs. If we adopt DeepSeek’s architecture, our models will be better. Because we have more compute and more data. r1 tells us it only takes ~800k samples of ‘good’ RL reasoning to convert other models into RL reasoners, and Alex Dimakis says it could be a lot less, in his test they outperformed o1-preview with only 17k. Now that r1 is out, everyone permanently has an unlimited source of at least pretty good samples. From now on, to create or release a model is to create or release the RL version of that model, even more than before. That’s on top of all the other modifications you automatically release. Oliver Blanchard: DeepSeek and what happened yesterday: Probably the largest positive tfp shock in the history of the world. The nerdy version, to react to some of the comments. (Yes, electricity was big): DeepSeek and what happened yesterday: Probably the largest positive one day change in the present discounted value of total factor productivity growth in the history of the world. James Steuart: I can’t agree Professor, Robert Gordon’s book gives many such greater examples. Electric lighting is a substantially greater TFP boost than marginally better efficiency in IT and professional services! There were some bigger inventions in the past, but on much smaller baselines. Our reaction to this was to sell the stocks of those who provide the inputs that enable that tfp shock. There were other impacts as well, including to existential risk, but as we’ve established the market isn’t ready for that conversation in the sense that the market (highly reasonably as has been previously explained) will be ignoring it entirely. Daniel Eth: Hot take, but if the narrative from NYT et al had not been “lol you don’t need that many chips to train AI systems” but instead “Apparently AI is *not* hitting a wall”, then the AI chip stocks would have risen instead of fallen. Billy Humblebrag: “Deepseek shows that ai can be built more cheaply than we thought so you don’t need to worry about ai” is a hell of a take Joe Weisenthal: Morgan Stanley: “We gathered feedback from a number of industry sources and the consistent takeaway is that this is not affecting plans for GPU buildouts.” I would not discount the role of narrative and vibes in all this. I don’t think that’s the whole Nvidia drop or anything. But it matters. Roon: Plausible reasons for Nvidia drop: We will want more compute now until the heat death of the universe; it’s the only reason that doesn’t make sense. Palmer Lucky: The markets are not smarter on AI. The free hand is not yet efficient because the number of legitimate experts in the field is near-zero. The average person making AI calls on Wall Street had no idea what AI even was a year ago and feels compelled to justify big moves. Alex Cheema notes that Apple was up on Monday, and that Apple’s chips are great for running v3 and r1 inference. Alex Cheema: Market close: $NVDA: -16.91% | $AAPL: +3.21% Why is DeepSeek great for Apple? Here’s a breakdown of the chips that can run DeepSeek V3 and R1 on the market now: NVIDIA H100: 80GB @ 3TB/s, $25,000, $312.50 per GB AMD MI300X: 192GB @ 5.3TB/s, $20,000, $104.17 per GB Apple M2 Ultra: 192GB @ 800GB/s, $5,000, $26.04(!!) per GB Apple’s M2 Ultra (released in June 2023) is 4x more cost efficient per unit of memory than AMD MI300X and 12x more cost efficient than NVIDIA H100! Eric Hartford: 3090s, $700 for 24gb = $29/gb. Alex Cheema: You need a lot of hardware around them to load a 700GB model in 30 RTX 3090s. I’d love to see it though, closest to this is probably stacking @__tinygrad__ boxes. That’s cute. But I do not think that was the main reason why Apple was up. I think Apple was up because their strategy doesn’t depend on having frontier models but it does depend on running AIs on iPhones. Apple can now get their own distillations of r1, and use them for Apple Intelligence. A highly reasonable argument. The One True Newsletter, Matt Levine’s Money Stuff, is of course on the case of DeepSeek’s r1 crashing the stock market, and asking what cheap inference for everyone would do to market prices. He rapidly shifts focus to non-AI companies, asking which ones benefit. It’s great if you use AI to make your management company awesome, but not if you get cut out because AI replaces your management company. (And you. And the people it manages. And all of us. And maybe we all die.) But I digress. (To digress even further: While I’m reading that column, I don’t understand why we should care about the argument under ‘Dark Trading,’ since this mechanism decreases retail transaction costs to trade and doesn’t impact long term price discovery at all, and several LLMs confirmed this once challenged.) Ben Thompson continues to give his completely different kind of technical tech company perspective, in FAQ format, including good technical explanations that agree with what I’ve said in previous columns. Here’s a fascinating line: Q: I asked why the stock prices are down; you just painted a positive picture! A: My picture is of the long run; today is the short run, and it seems likely the market is working through the shock of R1’s existence. That sounds like Ben Thompson is calling it a wrong-way move, and indeed later he explicitly endorses Jevons Paradox and expects compute use to rise. The market is supposed to factor in the long run now. There is no ‘this makes the price go down today and then up next week’ unless you’re very much in the ‘the EMH is false’ camp. And these are literally the most valuable companies in the world. Here’s another key one: Q: So are we close to AGI? A: It definitely seems like it. This also explains why Softbank (and whatever investors Masayoshi Son brings together) would provide the funding for OpenAI that Microsoft will not: the belief that we are reaching a takeoff point where there will in fact be real returns towards being first. Masayoshi Sun feels the AGI. Masayoshi Sun feels everything. He’s king of feeling it. His typical open-model-stanning arguments on existential risk later in the past are as always disappointing, but in no way new or unexpected. It continues to astound me that such intelligent people can think: Well, there’s no stopping us creating things more capable and intelligent than humans, so the best way to ensure that things smarter than more capable than humans go well for humans is to ensure that there are as many such entities as possible and that humans cannot possibly have any collective control over those new entities. On another level, of course, I’ve accepted that people do think this. That they somehow cannot fathom that if you create things more intelligent and capable and competitive than humans there could be the threat that all the humans would end up with no power, rather than that the wrong humans might have too much power. Or think that this would be a good thing – because the wrong humans wouldn’t have power. Similarly, Ben’s call for absolutely no regulations whatsoever, no efforts at safety whatsoever outside of direct profit motives, ‘cut out all the cruft in our companies that has nothing to do with winning,’ is exactly the kind of rhetoric I worry about getting us all killed in response to these developments. I should still reiterate that Ben to his credit is very responsible and accurate here in his technical presentation, laying out what DeepSeek and r1 are and aren’t accomplishing here rather than crying missile gap. But the closing message remains the same. The term Trump uses is ‘tariffs.’ I propose, at least in the context of GPUs, that we call these ‘import restrictions,’ in order to point out that we are (I believe wisely!) imposing ‘export restrictions’ as a matter of national security to ensure we get all the chips, and using diffusion regulations to force the chips to be hosted at home, then we are threatening to impose ‘up to 100%’ tariffs on those same chips, because ‘they left us’ and they want ‘to force them to come back,’ and they’ll build the new factories here instead of there, with their own money, because of the threat. Except for the fact that we really, really want the data centers at home. The diffusion regulations are largely to force companies to create them at home. Arthur B: Regarding possible US tariffs on Taiwan chips. First, this is one that US consumers would directly feel, it’s less politically feasible than tariffs on imports with lots of substitutes. Second, data centers don’t have to be located in the US. Canada is next door and has plenty of power. Dhiraj: Taiwan made the largest single greenfield FDI in US history through TSMC. Now, instead of receiving gratitude for helping the struggling US chip industry, Taiwan faces potential tariffs. In his zero-sum worldview, there are no friends. The whole thing is insane! Completely nuts. If he’s serious. And yes he said this on Joe Rogan previously, but he said a lot of things previously that he didn’t mean. Whereas Trump’s worldview is largely the madman theory, at least for trade. If you threaten people with insane moves that would hurt both of you, and show that you’re willing to actually enact insane moves, then they are forced to give you what you want. In this case, what Trump wants is presumably for TSMC to announce they are building more new chip factories in America. I agree that this would be excellent, assuming they were actually built. We have an existence proof that it can be done, and it would greatly improve our strategic position and reduce geopolitical risk. I presume Trump is mostly bluffing, in that he has no intention of actually imposing these completely insane tariffs, and he will ultimately take a minor win and declare victory. But what makes it nerve wracking is that, by design, you never know. If you did know none of this would ever work. Unless, some people wondered, there was another explanation for all this… Nabeel Qureshi (Tuesday, 2pm): Crazy that people in this corner of X have a faster OODA loop than the stock market This was the largest single day drop in a single stock in world history. It wiped out over $500 billion in market value. One had to wonder if it was partially insider trading. Timothy Lee: Everyone says DeepSeek caused Nvidia’s stock to crash yesterday. I think this theory makes no sense. DeepSeek’s success isn’t bad news for Nvidia. I don’t think that this was insider trading. The tariff threat was already partly known and thus priced in. It’s a threat rather than an action, which means it’s likely a bluff. That’s not a 17% move. Then we have the bounceback on Tuesday. Even if I was certain that this was mostly an insider trading move instead of being rather confident it mostly or entirely wasn’t, I wouldn’t go as far as Eliezer does in the the below quote. The SEC does many important things. But I do notice that there’s a non-zero amount of ‘wait a minute’ that will occur to me the next time I’m hovering around the buy button in haste. Eliezer Yudkowsky: I heard from many people who said, “An NVDA drop makes no sense as a Deepseek reaction; buying NVDA.” So those people have now been cheated by insider counterparties with political access. They may make fewer US trades in the future. Also note that the obvious meaning of this news is that someone told and convinced Trump that China will invade Taiwan before the end of his term, and the US needs to wean itself off Taiwanese dependence. This was a $400B market movement, and if @SECGov can’t figure out who did it then the SEC has no reason to exist. TBC, I’m not saying that figuring it out would be easy or bringing the criminals to justice would be easy. I’m saying that if the US markets are going to be like this anyway on $400B market movements, why bother paying the overhead cost of having an SEC that doesn’t work? Roon: [Trump’s tariff threats about Taiwan] didn’t move overnight markets at all which either means markets either: – don’t believe it’s credible – were pricing this in yesterday while internet was blaming the crash out on deepseek I certainly don’t agree that the only interpretation of this news is ‘Trump expects an invasion of Taiwan.’ Trump is perfectly capable of doing this for exactly the reasons he’s saying. Trump is also fully capable of making this threat with no intention of following through, in order to extract concessions from Taiwan or TSMC, perhaps of symbolic size. Trump is also fully capable of doing this so that he could inform his hedge fund friends in advance and they could make quite a lot of money – with or without any attempt to actually impose the tariffs ever, since his friends would have now covered their shorts in this scenario. Indeed do many things come to pass. I don’t know anything you don’t know. It would be a good sign if DeepSeek had a plan for safety, even if it wasn’t that strong? Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): DeepSeek should create a preparedness framework/RSP if they continue to scale reasoning models. Very happy to [help them with this]! We don’t quite have nothing. This below is the first actively positive sign for DeepSeek on safety, however small. Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): Does DeepSeek have any safety researchers? What are Liang Wenfeng’s views on AI safety? Sarah (YuanYuanSunSara): [DeepSeek] signed Artificial Intelligence safety commitment by CAICT (gov backed institute). You can see the whale sign at the bottom if you can’t read their name Chinese. This involves AI safety governance structure, safety testing, do frontier AGI safety research (include loss of control) and share it publicly. None legally binding but it’s a good sign. Here is a chart with the Seoul Commitments versus China’s version. It is of course much better that DeepSeek signed onto a symbolic document like this. That’s a good sign, whereas refusing would have been a very bad sign. But as always, talk is cheap, this doesn’t concretely commit DeepSeek to much, and even fully abiding by commitments like this won’t remotely be enough. I do think this is a very good sign that agreements and coordination are possible. But if we want that, we will have to Pick Up the Phone. Here’s a weird different answer. Joshua Achiam (OpenAI, Head of Mission Alignment): I think a better question is whether or not science fiction culture in China has a fixation on the kinds of topics that would help them think about it. If Three-Body Problem is any indication, things will be OK. It’s a question worth asking, but I don’t think this is a better question? And based on the book, I do not think Three-Body Problem (conceptual spoilers follow, potentially severe ones depending on your perspective) is great here. Consider the decision theory that those books endorse, and what happens to us and also the universe as a result. It’s presenting all of that as essentially inevitable, and trying to think otherwise as foolishness. It’s endorsing that what matters is paranoia, power and a willingness to use it without mercy in an endless war of all against all. Also consider how they paint the history of the universe entirely without AGI. I want to be clear that I fully agree with Bill Gurley that ‘no one at DeepSeek is an enemy of mine,’ indeed There Is No Enemy Anywhere, with at most notably rare exceptions that I invite to stop being exceptions. However, I do think that if they continue down their current path, they are liable to get us all killed. And I for one am going to take the bold stance that I think that this is bad, and they should therefore alter their path before reaching their stated destination. How committed is DeepSeek to its current path? Read this quote Ben Thompson links to very carefully: Q: DeepSeek, right now, has a kind of idealistic aura reminiscent of the early days of OpenAI, and it’s open source. Will you change to closed source later on? Both OpenAI and Mistral moved from open-source to closed-source. Answer from DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng: We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem first is more important. This is from November. And that’s not a no. That’s actually a maybe. Note what he didn’t say: A Different Answer: We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem is more important. The difference? His answer includes the word ‘first.’ He’s saying that first you need a strong technical ecosystem, and he believes that open models are the key to attracting talent and developing a strong technical ecosystem. Then, once that exists, you would need to protect your advantage. And yes, that is exactly what happened with… OpenAI. I wanted to be sure that this translation was correct, so I turned to Wenfang’s own r1, and asked the interviewer for the original statement, which was: 梁文锋：我们不会闭源。我们认为先有一个强大的技术生态更重要。 r1’s translation: “We will not close our source code. We believe that establishing a strong technological ecosystem must come first.” To quote r1: Based solely on this statement, Liang is asserting that openness is non-negotiable because it is essential to the ecosystem’s strength. While no one can predict the future, the phrasing suggests a long-term commitment to open-source as a core value, not a temporary tactic. To fully guarantee permanence, you’d need additional evidence (e.g., licensing choices, governance models, past behavior). But as it stands, the statement leans toward “permanent” in spirit. I interpret this as a statement of a pragmatic motivation – if that motivation changes, or a more important one is created, actions would change. For now, yes, openness. The Washington Post had a profile of DeepSeek and Liang Wenfeng. One note is that the hedge fund that they’re a spinoff from has donated over $80 million to charity since 2020, which makes it more plausible DeepSeek has no business model, or at least no medium-term business model. But that government embrace is new for DeepSeek, said Matt Sheehan, an expert on China’s AI industry at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “They were not the ‘chosen one’ of Chinese AI start-ups,” said Sheehan, noting that many other Chinese start-ups received more government funding and contracts. “DeepSeek took the world by surprise, and I think to a large extent, they took the Chinese government by surprise.” Sheehan added that for DeepSeek, more government attention will be a “double-edged sword.” While the company will probably have more access to government resources, “there’s going to be a lot of political scrutiny on them, and that has a cost of its own,” he said. Yes. This reinforces the theory that DeepSeek’s ascent took China’s government by surprise, and they had no idea what v3 and r1 were as they were released. Going forward, China is going to be far more aware. In some ways, DeepSeek will have lots of support. But there will be strings attached. That starts with the ordinary censorship demands of the CCP. If you self-host r1, and you ask it about any of the topics the CCP dislikes, r1 will give you a good, well-balanced answer. If you ask on DeepSeek’s website, it will censor you via some sort of cloud-based monitoring, which works if you’re closed source, but DeepSeek is trying to be fully open source. Something has to give, somewhere. Also, even if you’re using the official website, it’s not like you can’t get around it. Justine Moore: DeepSeek’s censorship is no match for the jailbreakers of Reddit I mean, that was easy. Joshua Achiam (OpenAI Head of Mission Alignment): This has deeply fascinating consequences for China in 10 years – when the CCP has to choose between allowing their AI industry to move forward, or maintaining censorship and tight ideological control, which will they choose? And if they choose their AI industry, especially if they favor open source as a strategy for worldwide influence: what does it mean for their national culture and government structure in the long run, when everyone who is curious can find ways to have subversive conversations? Ten years to figure this out? If they’re lucky, they’ve got two. My guess is they don’t. I worry about the failure to feel the AGI or even the AI here from Joshua Achiam, given his position at OpenAI. Ten years is a long time. Sam Altman expects AGI well before that. This goes well beyond Altman’s absurd position of ‘AGI will be invented and your life won’t noticeably change for a long time.’ Choices are going to need to be made. Even if AI doesn’t advance much from here, choices will have to be made. As I’ve noted before, censorship at the model layer is expensive. It’s harder to do, and when you do it you risk introducing falsity into a mind in ways that will have widespread repercussions. Even then, a fine tune can easily remove any gaps in knowledge, or any reluctance to discuss particular topics, whether they are actually dangerous things like building bombs or things that piss off the CCP like a certain bear that loves honey. I got called out on Twitter for supposed cognitive dissonance on this – look at China’s actions, they clearly let this happen. Again, my claim is that China didn’t realize what this was until after it happened, they can’t undo it (that’s the whole point!) and they are of course going to embrace their national champion. That has little to do with what paths DeepSeek is allowed to follow going forward. (Also, since it was mentioned in that response, I should note – there is a habit of people conflating ‘pause’ with ‘ever do anything to regulate AI at all.’ I do not believe I said anything about a pause – I was talking about whether China would let DeepSeek continue to release open weights as capabilities improve.) Before I further cover potential policy responses, a question we must ask this week is: I very much do not wish to do this at this time, but suppose in the future we did want to restrict use of a particular already open weights model and its derivatives, or all models in some reference class. What would our options be? Obviously we couldn’t fully ban it in terms of preventing determined people from having access. And if you try to stop them and others don’t, there are obvious problems with that, including ‘people have internet connections.’ However, that does not mean that we would have actual zero options. Steve Sailer: Does open source, low cost DeepSeek mean that there is no way, short of full-blown Butlerian Jihad against computers, which we won’t do, to keep AI bottled up, so we’re going to find out if Yudkowsky’s warnings that AI will go SkyNet and turn us into paperclips are right? Gabriel: It’s a psy-op If hosting a 70B is illegal: – Almost all individuals stop – All companies stop – All research labs stop – All compute providers stop Already huge if limited to US+EU Can argue about whether good/bad, but not about the effect size. You can absolutely argue about effect size. What you can’t argue is that the effect size isn’t large. It would make a big difference for many practical purposes. In terms of my ‘Levels of Friction’ framework (post forthcoming) this is moving the models from Level 1 (easy to access) to at least Level 3 (annoying with potential consequences.) That has big practical consequences, and many important use cases will indeed go away or change dramatically. What Level 3 absolutely won’t do, here or elsewhere, is save you from determined people who want it badly enough, or from sufficiently capable models that do not especially care what you tell them not to do or where you tell them not to be. Or scenarios where the law is no longer especially relevant, and the government or humanity is very much having a ‘do you feel in charge?’ moment. And that alone would, in many scenarios, be enough to doom you to varying degrees. If that’s what dooms you and the model is already open, well, you’re pretty doomed. And also it won’t save you from various scenarios where what the law thinks is not especially relevant. If for whatever reason the government or humanity decides (or realizes) that this is insufficient, then there are two possibilities. Either the government or humanity is disempowered and you hope that this works out for humanity in some way. Or we use the necessary means to push the restrictions up to Level 4 (akin to rape and murder) or Level 5 (akin to what we do to stop terrorism or worse), in ways I assure you that you are very much not going to like – but the alternative might be worse, and the decision might very much not be up to either of us. Actions have consequences. Plan for them. Adam Ozimek was first I saw point out this time around with DeepSeek (I and many others echo this a lot in general) that the best way for the Federal Government to ensure American dominance of AI is to encourage more high skilled immigration and brain drain the world. If you don’t want China to have DeepSeek, export controls are great and all but how about let’s straight up steal their engineers. But y’all, and by y’all I mean Donald Trump, aren’t ready for that conversation. It is highly unfortunate that David Sacks, the person seemingly in charge of what AI executive orders Trump signs, is so deeply confused about what various provisions actually did or would do, and on our regulatory situation relative to that of China. David Sacks: DeepSeek R1 shows that the AI race will be very competitive and that President Trump was right to rescind the Biden EO, which hamstrung American AI companies without asking whether China would do the same. (Obviously not.) I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent. Donald Trump: The release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win. … We’re going to dominate. We’ll dominate everything. This is the biggest danger of all – that we go full Missile Gap jingoism and full-on race to ‘beat China,’ and act like we can’t afford to do anything to ensure the safety of the AGIs and ASIs we plan on building, even pressuring labs not to make such efforts in private, or threatening them with antitrust or other interventions for trying. The full Trump clip is hilarious, including him saying they may have come up with a cheaper method but ‘no one knows if it is true.’ His main thrust is, oh, you made doing AI cheaper and gave it all away to us for free, thanks, that’s great! I love paying less money for things! And he’s presumably spinning, but he’s also not wrong about that. I also take some small comfort in him framing revoking the Biden EO purely in terms of wokeness. If that’s all he thinks was bad about it, that’s a great sign. Harlan Stewart: “Deepseek R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment” Sure. I guess it’s like if the Soviets had told the world how to make their own Sputniks and also offered everyone a lifetime supply of free Sputniks. And the US had already previously figured out how to make an even bigger Sputnik. Yishan: I think the Deepseek moment is not really the Sputnik moment, but more like the Google moment. If anyone was around in ~2004, you’ll know what I mean, but more on that later. I think everyone is over-rotated on this because Deepseek came out of China. Let me try to un-rotate you. Deepseek could have come out of some lab in the US Midwest. Like say some CS lab couldn’t afford the latest nVidia chips and had to use older hardware, but they had a great algo and systems department, and they found a bunch of optimizations and trained a model for a few million dollars and lo, the model is roughly on par with o1. Look everyone, we found a new training method and we optimized a bunch of algorithms! Everyone is like OH WOW and starts trying the same thing. Great week for AI advancement! No need for US markets to lose a trillion in market cap. The tech world (and apparently Wall Street) is massively over-rotated on this because it came out of CHINA. … Deepseek is MUCH more like the Google moment, because Google essentially described what it did and told everyone else how they could do it too. … There is no reason to think nVidia and OAI and Meta and Microsoft and Google et al are dead. Sure, Deepseek is a new and formidable upstart, but doesn’t that happen every week in the world of AI? I am sure that Sam and Zuck, backed by the power of Satya, can figure something out. Everyone is going to duplicate this feat in a few months and everything just got cheaper. The only real consequence is that AI utopia/doom is now closer than ever. I believe that alignment, and getting a good outcome for humans, was already going to be very hard. It’s going to be a lot harder if we actively try to get ourselves killed like this, and turn even what would have been relatively easy wins into losses. Whereas no, actually, if you want to win that has to include not dying, and also doing the alignment work helps you win, because it is the only way you can (sanely) get to deploy your AIs to do the most valuable tasks. Trump’s reaction of ‘we’ll dominate everything’ is far closer to correct. Our ‘lead’ is smaller than we thought, DeepSeek will be real competition, but we are very much still in the dominant position. We need to not lose sight of that. The Washington Post covers panic in Washington, and attempts to exploit this situation to do the opposite of wise policy. Tiku, Dou, Zakrzewski and De Vynck: Tech stocks dropped Monday. Spooked U.S. officials, engineers and investors reconsidered their views on the competitive threat posed by China in AI, and how the United States could stay ahead. While some Republicans and the Trump administration suggested the answer was to restrain China, prominent tech industry voices said DeepSeek’s ascent showed the benefits of openly sharing AI technology instead of keeping it closely held. This shows nothing of the kind, of course. DeepSeek fast followed, copied our insights and had insights of their own. Our insights were held insufficiently closely to prevent this, which at that stage was mostly unavoidable. They have now given away many of those new valuable insights, which we and others will copy, and also made the situation more dangerous. We should exploit that and learn from it, not make the same mistake. Robert Sterling: Might be a dumb question, but can’t OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies just incorporate the best parts of DeepSeek’s source code into their code, then use the massive GPU clusters at their disposal to train models even more powerful than DeepSeek? Am I missing something? Peter Wildeford: Not a dumb question, this is 100% correct And they already have more powerful models than Deepseek I fear we are caught between two different insane reactions. Restraining China is a good idea if implemented well, but insufficiently specified. Restrain them how? If this means export controls, I strongly agree – and then ask when we are then considering imposing those controls on ourselves via tariffs? What else is available? And I will keep saying ‘how about immigration to brain drain them’ because it seems wrong to ignore the utterly obvious. Chamath Palihapitiya says it’s inference time, we need to boot up our allies with it as quickly as possible (I agree) and that we should also boot up China by lifting export controls on inference chips, and also focus on supplying the Middle East. He notes he has a conflict of interest here. It seems not especially wise to hand over serious inference compute if we’re in a fight here. With the way these models are going, there’s a decent amount of fungibility between inference and training, and also there’s going to be tons of demand for inference. Why is it suddenly important to Chamath that the inference be done on chips we sold them? Capitalist insists rope markets must remain open during this trying time, and so on. (There’s also talk about ‘how asleep we’ve been for 15 years’ because we’re so inefficient and seriously everyone needs to calm down on this kind of thinking.) So alas, in the short run, we are left scrambling to prevent two equal and opposite deadly mistakes we seem to be dangerously close to collectively making. The CEO of DeepSeek himself said in November that the export controls and inability to access chips were the limiting factors on what they could do. Compute is vital. What did DeepSeek ask for with its newfound prestige? Support for compute infrastructure in China. Do not respond by being so suicidal as to remove or weaken those controls. Or, to shorten all that: Don’t do those things! Do take advantage of all the opportunities that have been opened up. And of course: Don’t panic!

Title: DeepSeek: Lemon, It’s Wednesday

Full Content:
It’s been another *checks notes* two days, so it’s time for all the latest DeepSeek news. You can also see my previous coverage of the r1 model and, from Monday various reactions including the Panic at the App Store. Before we get to new developments, I especially want to reiterate and emphasize the need to calm down about that $5.5 million ‘cost of training’ for v3. I wouldn’t quite agree with Palmer Lucky that ‘the $5m number is bogus’ and I wouldn’t call it a ‘Chinese psyop’ because I think we mostly did this to ourselves but it is very often being used in a highly bogus way – equating the direct compute cost of training v3 with the all-in cost of creating r1. Which is a very different number. DeepSeek is cracked, they cooked, and r1 is super impressive, but the $5.5 million v3 training cost: Altman handled his response to r1 with grace. OpenAI plans to ‘pull up some new releases.’ Meaning, oh, you want to race? I suppose I’ll go faster and take less precautions. Sam Altman: deepseek’s r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price. we will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. but mostly we are excited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission. the world is going to want to use a LOT of ai, and really be quite amazed by the next gen models coming. look forward to bringing you all AGI and beyond. It is very Galaxy Brain to say ‘this is perhaps good for OpenAI’ and presumably it very much is, but here’s a scenario. Ethan Mollick: DeepSeek is a really good model, but it is not generally a better model than o1 or Claude. But since it is both free & getting a ton of attention, I think a lot of people who were using free “mini” models are being exposed to what a early 2025 reasoner AI can do & are surprised I’m not saying that’s the baseline scenario, but I do expect the world to be quite amazed at the next generation of models, and they could now be more primed for that. Mark Chen (Chief Research Officer, OpenAI): Congrats to DeepSeek on producing an o1-level reasoning model! Their research paper demonstrates that they’ve independently found some of the core ideas that we did on our way to o1. However, I think the external response has been somewhat overblown, especially in narratives around cost. One implication of having two paradigms (pre-training and reasoning) is that we can optimize for a capability over two axes instead of one, which leads to lower costs. But it also means we have two axes along which we can scale, and we intend to push compute aggressively into both! As research in distillation matures, we’re also seeing that pushing on cost and pushing on capabilities are increasingly decoupled. The ability to serve at lower cost (especially at higher latency) doesn’t imply the ability to produce better capabilities. We will continue to improve our ability to serve models at lower cost, but we remain optimistic in our research roadmap, and will remain focused in executing on it. We’re excited to ship better models to you this quarter and over the year! Given the costs involved, and that you can scale to get better outputs, ‘serve faster and cheaper’ and ‘get better answers’ seem pretty linked, or are going to look rather similar. There is still a real and important difference between ‘I spend 10x as much compute to get 10x as many tokens to think with’ versus ‘I taught the model how to do longer CoT’ versus ‘I made the model smarter.’ Or at least I think there is. Should we now abandon all our plans to build gigantic data centers because DeepSeek showed we can run AI cheaper? No. Of course not. We’ll need more. Jevons Paradox and all that. Another question is compute governance. Does DeepSeek’s model prove that there’s no point in using compute thresholds for frontier model governance? My answer is no. DeepSeek did not mean the scaling laws stopped working. DeepSeek found new ways to scale and economize, and also to distill. But doing the same thing with more compute would have gotten better results, and indeed more compute is getting other labs better results if you don’t control for compute costs, and also they will now get to use these innovations themselves. Karen Hao: Much of the coverage has focused on U.S.-China tech competition. That misses a bigger story: DeepSeek has demonstrated that scaling up AI models relentlessly, a paradigm OpenAI introduced and champions, is not the only, and far from the best, way to develop AI. Yoavgo: This is trending in my feed, but I don’t get it. DeepSeek did not show that scale is not the way to go for AI (their base model is among the largest in parameter counts; their training data is huge, at 13 trillion tokens). They just scaled more efficiently. Thus far OpenAI & its peer scaling labs have sought to convince the public & policymakers that scaling is the best way to reach so-called AGI. This has always been more of an argument based in business than in science. Jon Stokes: Holy wow what do words even mean. What R1 does is a new type of scaling. It’s also GPU-intensive. In fact, the big mystery today in AI world is why NVIDIA dropped despite R1 demonstrating that GPUs are even more valuable than we thought they were. No part of this is coherent. Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): The real takeaway from DeepSeek is that with reasoning models you can achieve great performance with a small amount of compute. Now imagine what you can do with a large amount of compute. Noam Brown (OpenAI): Algorithmic breakthroughs and scaling are complementary, not in competition. The former bends the performance vs compute curve, while the latter moves further along the curve. Benjamin Todd: Deepseek hasn’t shown scaling doesn’t work. Take Deepseek’s techniques, apply 10x the compute, and you’ll get much better performance. And compute efficiency has always been part of the scaling paradigm. Ethan Mollick: The most unnerving part of the DeepSeek reaction online has been seeing folks take it as a sign that AI capability growth is not real. It signals the opposite, large improvements are possible, and is almost certain to kick off an acceleration in AI development through competition. I know a lot of people want AI to go away, but I am seeing so many interpretations of DeepSeek in ways that don’t really make sense, or misrepresent what they did. Dealing with the implications of AI, and trying to steer it towards positive use, is now more urgent, not less. Andrew Rettek: Deepseek means OPENAI just increased their effective compute by more than an OOM. OpenAI and Anthropic (in the forms of CEOs Sam Altman and Dario Amodei) have both expressed agreement on that since the release of r1, saying that they still believe the future involves very large and expensive training runs, including large amounts of compute on the RL step. David Sacks agreed as well, so the administration knows. One can think of all this as combining multiple distinct scaling laws. Mark Chen above talked about two axes but one could refer to at least four? Also you can extend to new modalities and use cases and so on. So essentially: Buckle up. Speaking of buckling up, nothing to see here, just a claimed 2x speed boost to r1, written by r1. Of course, that’s very different from r1 coming up with the idea. Aiden McLaughlin: switching to reasoners is like taking a sharp turn on a racetrack. everyone brakes to take the turn; for a moment, all cars look neck-and-neck when exiting the turn, small first-mover advantages compound. and ofc, some cars have enormous engines that eat up straight roads Dean Ball: I recommend trying not to overindex on the industry dynamics you’re observing now in light of the deepseek plot twist, or indeed of any particular plot twist. It’s a long game, and we’re riding a world-historical exponential. Things will change a lot, fast, again and again. It’s not that Jan is wrong, I’d be a lot more interested in paying for o1 pro if I had pdfs enabled, but… yeah. China Talk covers developments. The headline conclusion is that yes, compute very much will continue to be a key factor, everyone agrees on this. They note there is a potential budding DeepSeek partnership with ByteDance, which could unlock quite a lot of compute. Here was some shade: Founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng is the core person of DeepSeek. He is not the same type of person as Sam Altman. He is very knowledgeable about technology. Also important at least directionally: Pioneers vs. Chasers: ‘AI Progress Resembles a Step Function – Chasers Require 1/10th the Compute’ Fundamentally, DeepSeek was far more of an innovator than other Chinese AI companies, but it was still a chaser here, not a pioneer, except in compute efficiency, which is what chasers do best. If you want to maintain a lead and it’s much easier to follow than lead, well, time to get good and scale even more. Or you can realize you’re just feeding capability to the Chinese and break down crying and maybe keep your models for internal use, it’s an option. I found this odd: It’s odd because DeepSeek spent so little compute, and the efficiency gains pay for themselves in compute quite rapidly. And also the big companies are indeed releasing rapidly. Google and OpenAI are constantly shipping, even Anthropic ships. The idea of company focus seems more on point, and yes DeepSeek traded multimodality and other features for pure efficiency because they had to. Also note what they say later: As in, r1 is technically impressive as hell, and it definitely has its uses, but there’s a reason the existing models look like they do – the corners DeepSeek cut actually do matter for what people want. Of course DeepSeek will likely now turn to fixing such problems among other things and we’ll see how efficiently they can do that too. McKay Wrigley emphasizes the point that visible chain of thought (CoT) is a prompt debugger. It’s hard to go back to not seeing CoT after seeing CoT. Gallabytes reports that DeepSeek’s image model Janus Pro is a good first effort, but not good yet. Even if we were to ‘fully unlock’ all computing power in personal PCs for running AI, that would only increase available compute by ~10%, most compute is in data centers. We had a brief period where DeepSeek would serve you up r1 free and super fast. It turns out that’s not fully sustainable or at least needs time to scale as fast as demand rose, and you know how such folks feel about the ‘raise prices’ meme, Gallabytes: got used to r1 and now that it’s overloaded it’s hard to go back. @deepseek_ai please do something amazing and be the first LLM provider to offer surge pricing. the unofficial APIs are unusably slow. I too encountered slowness, and instantly it made me realize ‘yes the speed was a key part of why I loved this.’ DeItaone (January 27, 11:09am): DEEPSEEK SAYS SERVICE DEGRADED DUE TO ‘LARGE-SCALE MALICIOUS ATTACK’ Could be that. Could be too much demand and not enough supply. This will of course sort itself out in time, as long as you’re willing to pay, and it’s an open model so others can serve the model as well, but ‘everyone wants to use the shiny new model you are offering for free’ is going to run into obvious problems. Yes, of course one consideration is that if you use DeepSeek’s app it will collect all your data including device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address and so on and store it all in China. Did you for a second think otherwise? What you do with that info is on you. This doesn’t appear to rise to TikTok 2.0 levels of rendering your phone and data insecure, but let us say that ‘out of an abundance of caution’ I will be accessing the model through their website not the app thank you very much. Liv Boeree: tiktok round two, here we go. AI enthusiasts have the self control of an incontinent chihuahua. Typing Loudly: you can run it locally without an internet connection Liv Boeree: cool and what percentage of these incontinent chihuahuas will actually do this. I’m not going so far as to use third party providers for now, because I’m not feeding any sensitive data into the model, and DeepSeek’s implementation here is very nice and clean, so I’ve decided lazy is acceptable. I’m certainly not laying out ~$6,000 for a self-hosting rig, unless someone wants to buy one for me in the name of science. Note that if you’re looking for an alternative source, you want to ensure you’re not getting one of the smaller distillations, unless that is what you want. Janus is testing for steganography in r1, potentially looking for assistance. Janus also thinks Thebes theory here is likely to be true, that v3 was hurt by dividing into too many too small experts, but r1 lets them all dump their info into the CoT and collaborate, at least partially fixing this. Janus notes that r1 simply knows things and thinks about them, straight up, in response to Thebes speculating that all our chain of thought considerations have now put sufficient priming into the training data that CoT approaches work much better than they used to, which Prithviraj says is not the case, he says it’s about improved base models, which is the first obvious thought – the techniques work better off a stronger base, simple as that. Thebes: why did R1’s RL suddenly start working, when previous attempts to do similar things failed? theory: we’ve basically spent the last few years running a massive acausally distributed chain of thought data annotation program on the pretraining dataset. deepseek’s approach with R1 is a pretty obvious method. They are far from the first lab to try “slap a verifier on it and roll out CoTs.” But it didn’t used to work that well. … In the last couple of years, chains of thought have been posted all over the internet … Those CoTs in the V3 training set gave GRPO enough of a starting point to start converging, and furthermore, to generalize from verifiable domains to the non-verifiable ones using the bridge established by the pretraining data contamination. And now, R1’s visible chains of thought are going to lead to *another* massive enrichment of human-labeled reasoning on the internet, but on a far larger scale… The next round of base models post-R1 will be *even better* bases for reasoning models. in some possible worlds, this could also explain why OpenAI seemingly struggled so much with making their reasoning models in comparison. if they’re still using 4base or distils of it. Prithvraj: Simply, no. I’ve been looking at my old results from doing RL with “verifiable” rewards (math puzzle games, python code to pass unit tests) starting from 2019 with GPT-1/2 to 2024 with Qwen Math Deepseek’s success likely lies in the base models improving, the RL is constant Janus: This is an interesting hypothesis. DeepSeek R1 also just seems to have a much more lucid and high-resolution understanding of LLM ontology and history than any other model I’ve seen. (DeepSeek V3 did not seem to in my limited interactions with it, though.) I did not expect this on priors for a reasoner, but perhaps the main way that r1 seems smarter than any other LLM I’ve played with is the sheer lucidity and resolution of its world model—in particular, its knowledge of LLMs, both object- and meta-level, though this is also the main domain of knowledge I’ve engaged it in, and perhaps the only one I can evaluate at world-expert level. So, it may apply more generally. In effective fluid intelligence and attunement to real-time context, it actually feels weaker than, say, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. But when I talk to Sonnet about my ideas on LLMs, it feels like it is more naive than me, and it is figuring out a lot of things in context from “first principles.” When I talk to Opus about these things, it feels like it is understanding me by projecting the concepts onto more generic, resonant hyperobjects in its prior, meaning it is easy to get on the same page philosophically, but this tropological entanglement is not very precise. But with r1, it seems like it can simply reference the same concrete knowledge and ontology I have, much more like a peer. And it has intense opinions about these things. Wordgrammer thread on the DeepSeek technical breakthroughs. Here’s his conclusion, which seems rather overdetermined: Wordgrammer: “Is the US losing the war in AI??” I don’t think so. DeepSeek had a few big breakthroughs, we have had hundreds of small breakthroughs. If we adopt DeepSeek’s architecture, our models will be better. Because we have more compute and more data. r1 tells us it only takes ~800k samples of ‘good’ RL reasoning to convert other models into RL reasoners, and Alex Dimakis says it could be a lot less, in his test they outperformed o1-preview with only 17k. Now that r1 is out, everyone permanently has an unlimited source of at least pretty good samples. From now on, to create or release a model is to create or release the RL version of that model, even more than before. That’s on top of all the other modifications you automatically release. Oliver Blanchard: DeepSeek and what happened yesterday: Probably the largest positive tfp shock in the history of the world. The nerdy version, to react to some of the comments. (Yes, electricity was big): DeepSeek and what happened yesterday: Probably the largest positive one day change in the present discounted value of total factor productivity growth in the history of the world. James Steuart: I can’t agree Professor, Robert Gordon’s book gives many such greater examples. Electric lighting is a substantially greater TFP boost than marginally better efficiency in IT and professional services! There were some bigger inventions in the past, but on much smaller baselines. Our reaction to this was to sell the stocks of those who provide the inputs that enable that tfp shock. There were other impacts as well, including to existential risk, but as we’ve established the market isn’t ready for that conversation in the sense that the market (highly reasonably as has been previously explained) will be ignoring it entirely. Daniel Eth: Hot take, but if the narrative from NYT et al had not been “lol you don’t need that many chips to train AI systems” but instead “Apparently AI is *not* hitting a wall”, then the AI chip stocks would have risen instead of fallen. Billy Humblebrag: “Deepseek shows that ai can be built more cheaply than we thought so you don’t need to worry about ai” is a hell of a take Joe Weisenthal: Morgan Stanley: “We gathered feedback from a number of industry sources and the consistent takeaway is that this is not affecting plans for GPU buildouts.” I would not discount the role of narrative and vibes in all this. I don’t think that’s the whole Nvidia drop or anything. But it matters. Roon: Plausible reasons for Nvidia drop: We will want more compute now until the heat death of the universe; it’s the only reason that doesn’t make sense. Palmer Lucky: The markets are not smarter on AI. The free hand is not yet efficient because the number of legitimate experts in the field is near-zero. The average person making AI calls on Wall Street had no idea what AI even was a year ago and feels compelled to justify big moves. Alex Cheema notes that Apple was up on Monday, and that Apple’s chips are great for running v3 and r1 inference. Alex Cheema: Market close: $NVDA: -16.91% | $AAPL: +3.21% Why is DeepSeek great for Apple? Here’s a breakdown of the chips that can run DeepSeek V3 and R1 on the market now: NVIDIA H100: 80GB @ 3TB/s, $25,000, $312.50 per GB AMD MI300X: 192GB @ 5.3TB/s, $20,000, $104.17 per GB Apple M2 Ultra: 192GB @ 800GB/s, $5,000, $26.04(!!) per GB Apple’s M2 Ultra (released in June 2023) is 4x more cost efficient per unit of memory than AMD MI300X and 12x more cost efficient than NVIDIA H100! Eric Hartford: 3090s, $700 for 24gb = $29/gb. Alex Cheema: You need a lot of hardware around them to load a 700GB model in 30 RTX 3090s. I’d love to see it though, closest to this is probably stacking @__tinygrad__ boxes. That’s cute. But I do not think that was the main reason why Apple was up. I think Apple was up because their strategy doesn’t depend on having frontier models but it does depend on running AIs on iPhones. Apple can now get their own distillations of r1, and use them for Apple Intelligence. A highly reasonable argument. The One True Newsletter, Matt Levine’s Money Stuff, is of course on the case of DeepSeek’s r1 crashing the stock market, and asking what cheap inference for everyone would do to market prices. He rapidly shifts focus to non-AI companies, asking which ones benefit. It’s great if you use AI to make your management company awesome, but not if you get cut out because AI replaces your management company. (And you. And the people it manages. And all of us. And maybe we all die.) But I digress. (To digress even further: While I’m reading that column, I don’t understand why we should care about the argument under ‘Dark Trading,’ since this mechanism decreases retail transaction costs to trade and doesn’t impact long term price discovery at all, and several LLMs confirmed this once challenged.) Ben Thompson continues to give his completely different kind of technical tech company perspective, in FAQ format, including good technical explanations that agree with what I’ve said in previous columns. Here’s a fascinating line: Q: I asked why the stock prices are down; you just painted a positive picture! A: My picture is of the long run; today is the short run, and it seems likely the market is working through the shock of R1’s existence. That sounds like Ben Thompson is calling it a wrong-way move, and indeed later he explicitly endorses Jevons Paradox and expects compute use to rise. The market is supposed to factor in the long run now. There is no ‘this makes the price go down today and then up next week’ unless you’re very much in the ‘the EMH is false’ camp. And these are literally the most valuable companies in the world. Here’s another key one: Q: So are we close to AGI? A: It definitely seems like it. This also explains why Softbank (and whatever investors Masayoshi Son brings together) would provide the funding for OpenAI that Microsoft will not: the belief that we are reaching a takeoff point where there will in fact be real returns towards being first. Masayoshi Sun feels the AGI. Masayoshi Sun feels everything. He’s king of feeling it. His typical open-model-stanning arguments on existential risk later in the past are as always disappointing, but in no way new or unexpected. It continues to astound me that such intelligent people can think: Well, there’s no stopping us creating things more capable and intelligent than humans, so the best way to ensure that things smarter than more capable than humans go well for humans is to ensure that there are as many such entities as possible and that humans cannot possibly have any collective control over those new entities. On another level, of course, I’ve accepted that people do think this. That they somehow cannot fathom that if you create things more intelligent and capable and competitive than humans there could be the threat that all the humans would end up with no power, rather than that the wrong humans might have too much power. Or think that this would be a good thing – because the wrong humans wouldn’t have power. Similarly, Ben’s call for absolutely no regulations whatsoever, no efforts at safety whatsoever outside of direct profit motives, ‘cut out all the cruft in our companies that has nothing to do with winning,’ is exactly the kind of rhetoric I worry about getting us all killed in response to these developments. I should still reiterate that Ben to his credit is very responsible and accurate here in his technical presentation, laying out what DeepSeek and r1 are and aren’t accomplishing here rather than crying missile gap. But the closing message remains the same. The term Trump uses is ‘tariffs.’ I propose, at least in the context of GPUs, that we call these ‘import restrictions,’ in order to point out that we are (I believe wisely!) imposing ‘export restrictions’ as a matter of national security to ensure we get all the chips, and using diffusion regulations to force the chips to be hosted at home, then we are threatening to impose ‘up to 100%’ tariffs on those same chips, because ‘they left us’ and they want ‘to force them to come back,’ and they’ll build the new factories here instead of there, with their own money, because of the threat. Except for the fact that we really, really want the data centers at home. The diffusion regulations are largely to force companies to create them at home. Arthur B: Regarding possible US tariffs on Taiwan chips. First, this is one that US consumers would directly feel, it’s less politically feasible than tariffs on imports with lots of substitutes. Second, data centers don’t have to be located in the US. Canada is next door and has plenty of power. Dhiraj: Taiwan made the largest single greenfield FDI in US history through TSMC. Now, instead of receiving gratitude for helping the struggling US chip industry, Taiwan faces potential tariffs. In his zero-sum worldview, there are no friends. The whole thing is insane! Completely nuts. If he’s serious. And yes he said this on Joe Rogan previously, but he said a lot of things previously that he didn’t mean. Whereas Trump’s worldview is largely the madman theory, at least for trade. If you threaten people with insane moves that would hurt both of you, and show that you’re willing to actually enact insane moves, then they are forced to give you what you want. In this case, what Trump wants is presumably for TSMC to announce they are building more new chip factories in America. I agree that this would be excellent, assuming they were actually built. We have an existence proof that it can be done, and it would greatly improve our strategic position and reduce geopolitical risk. I presume Trump is mostly bluffing, in that he has no intention of actually imposing these completely insane tariffs, and he will ultimately take a minor win and declare victory. But what makes it nerve wracking is that, by design, you never know. If you did know none of this would ever work. Unless, some people wondered, there was another explanation for all this… Nabeel Qureshi (Tuesday, 2pm): Crazy that people in this corner of X have a faster OODA loop than the stock market This was the largest single day drop in a single stock in world history. It wiped out over $500 billion in market value. One had to wonder if it was partially insider trading. Timothy Lee: Everyone says DeepSeek caused Nvidia’s stock to crash yesterday. I think this theory makes no sense. DeepSeek’s success isn’t bad news for Nvidia. I don’t think that this was insider trading. The tariff threat was already partly known and thus priced in. It’s a threat rather than an action, which means it’s likely a bluff. That’s not a 17% move. Then we have the bounceback on Tuesday. Even if I was certain that this was mostly an insider trading move instead of being rather confident it mostly or entirely wasn’t, I wouldn’t go as far as Eliezer does in the the below quote. The SEC does many important things. But I do notice that there’s a non-zero amount of ‘wait a minute’ that will occur to me the next time I’m hovering around the buy button in haste. Eliezer Yudkowsky: I heard from many people who said, “An NVDA drop makes no sense as a Deepseek reaction; buying NVDA.” So those people have now been cheated by insider counterparties with political access. They may make fewer US trades in the future. Also note that the obvious meaning of this news is that someone told and convinced Trump that China will invade Taiwan before the end of his term, and the US needs to wean itself off Taiwanese dependence. This was a $400B market movement, and if @SECGov can’t figure out who did it then the SEC has no reason to exist. TBC, I’m not saying that figuring it out would be easy or bringing the criminals to justice would be easy. I’m saying that if the US markets are going to be like this anyway on $400B market movements, why bother paying the overhead cost of having an SEC that doesn’t work? Roon: [Trump’s tariff threats about Taiwan] didn’t move overnight markets at all which either means markets either: – don’t believe it’s credible – were pricing this in yesterday while internet was blaming the crash out on deepseek I certainly don’t agree that the only interpretation of this news is ‘Trump expects an invasion of Taiwan.’ Trump is perfectly capable of doing this for exactly the reasons he’s saying. Trump is also fully capable of making this threat with no intention of following through, in order to extract concessions from Taiwan or TSMC, perhaps of symbolic size. Trump is also fully capable of doing this so that he could inform his hedge fund friends in advance and they could make quite a lot of money – with or without any attempt to actually impose the tariffs ever, since his friends would have now covered their shorts in this scenario. Indeed do many things come to pass. I don’t know anything you don’t know. It would be a good sign if DeepSeek had a plan for safety, even if it wasn’t that strong? Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): DeepSeek should create a preparedness framework/RSP if they continue to scale reasoning models. Very happy to [help them with this]! We don’t quite have nothing. This below is the first actively positive sign for DeepSeek on safety, however small. Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): Does DeepSeek have any safety researchers? What are Liang Wenfeng’s views on AI safety? Sarah (YuanYuanSunSara): [DeepSeek] signed Artificial Intelligence safety commitment by CAICT (gov backed institute). You can see the whale sign at the bottom if you can’t read their name Chinese. This involves AI safety governance structure, safety testing, do frontier AGI safety research (include loss of control) and share it publicly. None legally binding but it’s a good sign. Here is a chart with the Seoul Commitments versus China’s version. It is of course much better that DeepSeek signed onto a symbolic document like this. That’s a good sign, whereas refusing would have been a very bad sign. But as always, talk is cheap, this doesn’t concretely commit DeepSeek to much, and even fully abiding by commitments like this won’t remotely be enough. I do think this is a very good sign that agreements and coordination are possible. But if we want that, we will have to Pick Up the Phone. Here’s a weird different answer. Joshua Achiam (OpenAI, Head of Mission Alignment): I think a better question is whether or not science fiction culture in China has a fixation on the kinds of topics that would help them think about it. If Three-Body Problem is any indication, things will be OK. It’s a question worth asking, but I don’t think this is a better question? And based on the book, I do not think Three-Body Problem (conceptual spoilers follow, potentially severe ones depending on your perspective) is great here. Consider the decision theory that those books endorse, and what happens to us and also the universe as a result. It’s presenting all of that as essentially inevitable, and trying to think otherwise as foolishness. It’s endorsing that what matters is paranoia, power and a willingness to use it without mercy in an endless war of all against all. Also consider how they paint the history of the universe entirely without AGI. I want to be clear that I fully agree with Bill Gurley that ‘no one at DeepSeek is an enemy of mine,’ indeed There Is No Enemy Anywhere, with at most notably rare exceptions that I invite to stop being exceptions. However, I do think that if they continue down their current path, they are liable to get us all killed. And I for one am going to take the bold stance that I think that this is bad, and they should therefore alter their path before reaching their stated destination. How committed is DeepSeek to its current path? Read this quote Ben Thompson links to very carefully: Q: DeepSeek, right now, has a kind of idealistic aura reminiscent of the early days of OpenAI, and it’s open source. Will you change to closed source later on? Both OpenAI and Mistral moved from open-source to closed-source. Answer from DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng: We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem first is more important. This is from November. And that’s not a no. That’s actually a maybe. Note what he didn’t say: A Different Answer: We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem is more important. The difference? His answer includes the word ‘first.’ He’s saying that first you need a strong technical ecosystem, and he believes that open models are the key to attracting talent and developing a strong technical ecosystem. Then, once that exists, you would need to protect your advantage. And yes, that is exactly what happened with… OpenAI. I wanted to be sure that this translation was correct, so I turned to Wenfang’s own r1, and asked the interviewer for the original statement, which was: 梁文锋：我们不会闭源。我们认为先有一个强大的技术生态更重要。 r1’s translation: “We will not close our source code. We believe that establishing a strong technological ecosystem must come first.” To quote r1: Based solely on this statement, Liang is asserting that openness is non-negotiable because it is essential to the ecosystem’s strength. While no one can predict the future, the phrasing suggests a long-term commitment to open-source as a core value, not a temporary tactic. To fully guarantee permanence, you’d need additional evidence (e.g., licensing choices, governance models, past behavior). But as it stands, the statement leans toward “permanent” in spirit. I interpret this as a statement of a pragmatic motivation – if that motivation changes, or a more important one is created, actions would change. For now, yes, openness. The Washington Post had a profile of DeepSeek and Liang Wenfeng. One note is that the hedge fund that they’re a spinoff from has donated over $80 million to charity since 2020, which makes it more plausible DeepSeek has no business model, or at least no medium-term business model. But that government embrace is new for DeepSeek, said Matt Sheehan, an expert on China’s AI industry at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “They were not the ‘chosen one’ of Chinese AI start-ups,” said Sheehan, noting that many other Chinese start-ups received more government funding and contracts. “DeepSeek took the world by surprise, and I think to a large extent, they took the Chinese government by surprise.” Sheehan added that for DeepSeek, more government attention will be a “double-edged sword.” While the company will probably have more access to government resources, “there’s going to be a lot of political scrutiny on them, and that has a cost of its own,” he said. Yes. This reinforces the theory that DeepSeek’s ascent took China’s government by surprise, and they had no idea what v3 and r1 were as they were released. Going forward, China is going to be far more aware. In some ways, DeepSeek will have lots of support. But there will be strings attached. That starts with the ordinary censorship demands of the CCP. If you self-host r1, and you ask it about any of the topics the CCP dislikes, r1 will give you a good, well-balanced answer. If you ask on DeepSeek’s website, it will censor you via some sort of cloud-based monitoring, which works if you’re closed source, but DeepSeek is trying to be fully open source. Something has to give, somewhere. Also, even if you’re using the official website, it’s not like you can’t get around it. Justine Moore: DeepSeek’s censorship is no match for the jailbreakers of Reddit I mean, that was easy. Joshua Achiam (OpenAI Head of Mission Alignment): This has deeply fascinating consequences for China in 10 years – when the CCP has to choose between allowing their AI industry to move forward, or maintaining censorship and tight ideological control, which will they choose? And if they choose their AI industry, especially if they favor open source as a strategy for worldwide influence: what does it mean for their national culture and government structure in the long run, when everyone who is curious can find ways to have subversive conversations? Ten years to figure this out? If they’re lucky, they’ve got two. My guess is they don’t. I worry about the failure to feel the AGI or even the AI here from Joshua Achiam, given his position at OpenAI. Ten years is a long time. Sam Altman expects AGI well before that. This goes well beyond Altman’s absurd position of ‘AGI will be invented and your life won’t noticeably change for a long time.’ Choices are going to need to be made. Even if AI doesn’t advance much from here, choices will have to be made. As I’ve noted before, censorship at the model layer is expensive. It’s harder to do, and when you do it you risk introducing falsity into a mind in ways that will have widespread repercussions. Even then, a fine tune can easily remove any gaps in knowledge, or any reluctance to discuss particular topics, whether they are actually dangerous things like building bombs or things that piss off the CCP like a certain bear that loves honey. I got called out on Twitter for supposed cognitive dissonance on this – look at China’s actions, they clearly let this happen. Again, my claim is that China didn’t realize what this was until after it happened, they can’t undo it (that’s the whole point!) and they are of course going to embrace their national champion. That has little to do with what paths DeepSeek is allowed to follow going forward. (Also, since it was mentioned in that response, I should note – there is a habit of people conflating ‘pause’ with ‘ever do anything to regulate AI at all.’ I do not believe I said anything about a pause – I was talking about whether China would let DeepSeek continue to release open weights as capabilities improve.) Before I further cover potential policy responses, a question we must ask this week is: I very much do not wish to do this at this time, but suppose in the future we did want to restrict use of a particular already open weights model and its derivatives, or all models in some reference class. What would our options be? Obviously we couldn’t fully ban it in terms of preventing determined people from having access. And if you try to stop them and others don’t, there are obvious problems with that, including ‘people have internet connections.’ However, that does not mean that we would have actual zero options. Steve Sailer: Does open source, low cost DeepSeek mean that there is no way, short of full-blown Butlerian Jihad against computers, which we won’t do, to keep AI bottled up, so we’re going to find out if Yudkowsky’s warnings that AI will go SkyNet and turn us into paperclips are right? Gabriel: It’s a psy-op If hosting a 70B is illegal: – Almost all individuals stop – All companies stop – All research labs stop – All compute providers stop Already huge if limited to US+EU Can argue about whether good/bad, but not about the effect size. You can absolutely argue about effect size. What you can’t argue is that the effect size isn’t large. It would make a big difference for many practical purposes. In terms of my ‘Levels of Friction’ framework (post forthcoming) this is moving the models from Level 1 (easy to access) to at least Level 3 (annoying with potential consequences.) That has big practical consequences, and many important use cases will indeed go away or change dramatically. What Level 3 absolutely won’t do, here or elsewhere, is save you from determined people who want it badly enough, or from sufficiently capable models that do not especially care what you tell them not to do or where you tell them not to be. Or scenarios where the law is no longer especially relevant, and the government or humanity is very much having a ‘do you feel in charge?’ moment. And that alone would, in many scenarios, be enough to doom you to varying degrees. If that’s what dooms you and the model is already open, well, you’re pretty doomed. And also it won’t save you from various scenarios where what the law thinks is not especially relevant. If for whatever reason the government or humanity decides (or realizes) that this is insufficient, then there are two possibilities. Either the government or humanity is disempowered and you hope that this works out for humanity in some way. Or we use the necessary means to push the restrictions up to Level 4 (akin to rape and murder) or Level 5 (akin to what we do to stop terrorism or worse), in ways I assure you that you are very much not going to like – but the alternative might be worse, and the decision might very much not be up to either of us. Actions have consequences. Plan for them. Adam Ozimek was first I saw point out this time around with DeepSeek (I and many others echo this a lot in general) that the best way for the Federal Government to ensure American dominance of AI is to encourage more high skilled immigration and brain drain the world. If you don’t want China to have DeepSeek, export controls are great and all but how about let’s straight up steal their engineers. But y’all, and by y’all I mean Donald Trump, aren’t ready for that conversation. It is highly unfortunate that David Sacks, the person seemingly in charge of what AI executive orders Trump signs, is so deeply confused about what various provisions actually did or would do, and on our regulatory situation relative to that of China. David Sacks: DeepSeek R1 shows that the AI race will be very competitive and that President Trump was right to rescind the Biden EO, which hamstrung American AI companies without asking whether China would do the same. (Obviously not.) I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent. Donald Trump: The release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win. … We’re going to dominate. We’ll dominate everything. This is the biggest danger of all – that we go full Missile Gap jingoism and full-on race to ‘beat China,’ and act like we can’t afford to do anything to ensure the safety of the AGIs and ASIs we plan on building, even pressuring labs not to make such efforts in private, or threatening them with antitrust or other interventions for trying. The full Trump clip is hilarious, including him saying they may have come up with a cheaper method but ‘no one knows if it is true.’ His main thrust is, oh, you made doing AI cheaper and gave it all away to us for free, thanks, that’s great! I love paying less money for things! And he’s presumably spinning, but he’s also not wrong about that. I also take some small comfort in him framing revoking the Biden EO purely in terms of wokeness. If that’s all he thinks was bad about it, that’s a great sign. Harlan Stewart: “Deepseek R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment” Sure. I guess it’s like if the Soviets had told the world how to make their own Sputniks and also offered everyone a lifetime supply of free Sputniks. And the US had already previously figured out how to make an even bigger Sputnik. Yishan: I think the Deepseek moment is not really the Sputnik moment, but more like the Google moment. If anyone was around in ~2004, you’ll know what I mean, but more on that later. I think everyone is over-rotated on this because Deepseek came out of China. Let me try to un-rotate you. Deepseek could have come out of some lab in the US Midwest. Like say some CS lab couldn’t afford the latest nVidia chips and had to use older hardware, but they had a great algo and systems department, and they found a bunch of optimizations and trained a model for a few million dollars and lo, the model is roughly on par with o1. Look everyone, we found a new training method and we optimized a bunch of algorithms! Everyone is like OH WOW and starts trying the same thing. Great week for AI advancement! No need for US markets to lose a trillion in market cap. The tech world (and apparently Wall Street) is massively over-rotated on this because it came out of CHINA. … Deepseek is MUCH more like the Google moment, because Google essentially described what it did and told everyone else how they could do it too. … There is no reason to think nVidia and OAI and Meta and Microsoft and Google et al are dead. Sure, Deepseek is a new and formidable upstart, but doesn’t that happen every week in the world of AI? I am sure that Sam and Zuck, backed by the power of Satya, can figure something out. Everyone is going to duplicate this feat in a few months and everything just got cheaper. The only real consequence is that AI utopia/doom is now closer than ever. I believe that alignment, and getting a good outcome for humans, was already going to be very hard. It’s going to be a lot harder if we actively try to get ourselves killed like this, and turn even what would have been relatively easy wins into losses. Whereas no, actually, if you want to win that has to include not dying, and also doing the alignment work helps you win, because it is the only way you can (sanely) get to deploy your AIs to do the most valuable tasks. Trump’s reaction of ‘we’ll dominate everything’ is far closer to correct. Our ‘lead’ is smaller than we thought, DeepSeek will be real competition, but we are very much still in the dominant position. We need to not lose sight of that. The Washington Post covers panic in Washington, and attempts to exploit this situation to do the opposite of wise policy. Tiku, Dou, Zakrzewski and De Vynck: Tech stocks dropped Monday. Spooked U.S. officials, engineers and investors reconsidered their views on the competitive threat posed by China in AI, and how the United States could stay ahead. While some Republicans and the Trump administration suggested the answer was to restrain China, prominent tech industry voices said DeepSeek’s ascent showed the benefits of openly sharing AI technology instead of keeping it closely held. This shows nothing of the kind, of course. DeepSeek fast followed, copied our insights and had insights of their own. Our insights were held insufficiently closely to prevent this, which at that stage was mostly unavoidable. They have now given away many of those new valuable insights, which we and others will copy, and also made the situation more dangerous. We should exploit that and learn from it, not make the same mistake. Robert Sterling: Might be a dumb question, but can’t OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies just incorporate the best parts of DeepSeek’s source code into their code, then use the massive GPU clusters at their disposal to train models even more powerful than DeepSeek? Am I missing something? Peter Wildeford: Not a dumb question, this is 100% correct And they already have more powerful models than Deepseek I fear we are caught between two different insane reactions. Restraining China is a good idea if implemented well, but insufficiently specified. Restrain them how? If this means export controls, I strongly agree – and then ask when we are then considering imposing those controls on ourselves via tariffs? What else is available? And I will keep saying ‘how about immigration to brain drain them’ because it seems wrong to ignore the utterly obvious. Chamath Palihapitiya says it’s inference time, we need to boot up our allies with it as quickly as possible (I agree) and that we should also boot up China by lifting export controls on inference chips, and also focus on supplying the Middle East. He notes he has a conflict of interest here. It seems not especially wise to hand over serious inference compute if we’re in a fight here. With the way these models are going, there’s a decent amount of fungibility between inference and training, and also there’s going to be tons of demand for inference. Why is it suddenly important to Chamath that the inference be done on chips we sold them? Capitalist insists rope markets must remain open during this trying time, and so on. (There’s also talk about ‘how asleep we’ve been for 15 years’ because we’re so inefficient and seriously everyone needs to calm down on this kind of thinking.) So alas, in the short run, we are left scrambling to prevent two equal and opposite deadly mistakes we seem to be dangerously close to collectively making. The CEO of DeepSeek himself said in November that the export controls and inability to access chips were the limiting factors on what they could do. Compute is vital. What did DeepSeek ask for with its newfound prestige? Support for compute infrastructure in China. Do not respond by being so suicidal as to remove or weaken those controls. Or, to shorten all that: Don’t do those things! Do take advantage of all the opportunities that have been opened up. And of course: Don’t panic!

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Title: Czech central bank chief proposes huge Bitcoin investment – FT
URL: https://www.rt.com/business/611846-czech-central-bank-bitcoin-investment/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T14:55:43Z
Full Content:
The governor of the Czech National Bank (CNB), Ales Michl, wants to invest a substantial amount of the country’s reserves in Bitcoin, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. The value of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency hit a new record earlier this month following the inauguration of crypto-friendly US President Donald Trump. Michl told the FT that he will present a proposal to the CNB’s board on Thursday, to invest up to 5% of the central bank’s €140 billion ($145 billion) reserves in crypto. “For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good,” Michl told the publication. The FT has described the potential move as “groundbreaking” and noted that the CNB could become the first Western central bank to hold crypto assets. “Those [Trump] guys can now kind of create some bubble for Bitcoin, but I think the trend would be an increase without those guys as well, because it’s an alternative [investment] for more people,” Michl added. The banker also acknowledged the asset’s volatility, saying he was “ready” for a possible Bitcoin collapse. Central banks traditionally hold their reserves in conservative assets such as US Treasuries and other forms of high-yield debt. Some have holdings in stocks, but almost none have publicly ventured into cryptocurrencies, the FT noted. Bitcoin hit a new record high this month after Trump was sworn in, surpassing $109,000. Days into his term, the new US president signed an executive order establishing a working group to explore the creation of a national digital asset stockpile. Last year, the value of Bitcoin more than doubled, thanks partially to the approval of trading of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) shares by a US regulator. According to Michl, more central banks could follow his lead within the next five years, as several funds and commercial banks have started investing in crypto. Larry Fink, CEO of investment company BlackRock suggested recently that if institutions allocate between 2% and 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, its price could reach $700,000. Introduced in 2009, Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions over the internet without the need for traditional banking systems. Its decentralized nature appeals to those seeking alternatives to government-backed currencies. However, this same feature has allegedly made it attractive for illicit activities, including money laundering and terrorist financing. Bitcoin’s value is influenced by factors such as supply and demand dynamics, market availability, competition from other cryptocurrencies, and investor sentiment. Despite its growing use in commerce, Bitcoin operates in a regulatory gray area, with no uniform international laws governing its use. El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as an official currency in 2021, although many governments remain cautious, warning about the risks associated with investing in such a volatile asset.

Wall Street was headed for a muted open after the Nasdaq closed 2% higher Tuesday and made back a big chunk of Monday's big DeepSeek-driven selloff. The market is still heavily overbought, so I'm more inclined to reduce stock exposure than increase it. 2. Our Big Tech names start reporting earnings Wednesday evening, beginning with Meta Platforms and Microsoft. KeyBanc raised its Meta price target to $750 per share from $700, expecting better-than-expected numbers after the bell. 3. OpenAI and Microsoft are looking into whether a group linked to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used data from ChatGPT without permission, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, China-based tech giant Alibaba says it has something faster than DeepSeek. 4. Starbucks shares were jumping 3% early Wednesday on evidence that CEO Brian Niccol's turn around has begun. But it won't be fast because the former Chipotle chief inherited had so many issues involving partners and customers and throughput, especially mobile ordering. Club name Starbucks reported better than expected earnings and revenue after Tuesday's close. 5. Club stock Nextracker was soaring more than 20%, the morning after the U.S.-based solar company delivered a quarterly beat and outlook raise. Barclays upgraded Nextracker on flawless execution. President Donald Trump has said he's a "big fan of solar," but his feelings toward government renewable energy and solar tax credits are unclear. 6. Danaher shares were dropping roughly 6% early Wednesday, shortly after the life sciences company missed on earnings and beat on revenue. The Club name preannounced so that's not much of a surprise. Investors were focusing on the outlook, which was soft for both the current quarter and the full year. 7. Apple, which reports earnings Thursday evening, is teaming up with T-Mobile and Elon Musk's SpaceX to support Starlink on iPhones, Bloomberg reported. This could be very significant. T-Mobile previously said Starlink was available on some Samsung phones. Apple already enables Globalstar. 8. Club name CrowdStrike said it got a perfect score on the prevention and detection of ransomware on SE Labs tests, which are the gold standard evaluating cybersecurity companies' abilities. 9. Dutch company ASML Holding reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue and said that DeepSeek is good news because it promotes the democratization of AI. I think that idea might be too positive, but the numbers are driving other semiconductor equipment makers higher, including U.S.-based Applied Materials. 10. Nucor CEO Leon Topalian was on Tuesday evening's "Mad Money," predicting that there will be a renaissance in American made steel after tariffs are put on Mexican and Canadian transshipments.

Title: DeepSeek Panic Live Updates: Alibaba Stock Rallies As Chinese Giant Says AI Model Beats DeepSeek’s

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company.

Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Title: DeepSeek Panic Live Updates: Alibaba Stock Rallies As Chinese Giant Says AI Model Beats DeepSeek’s

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history.

Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment."

Microsoft (MSFT-6.12%) and OpenAI are investigating whether a group connected to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek accessed OpenAI’s data without permission, according to a new report. Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reports that Microsoft’s security team noticed unusual activity last fall in which individuals, believed to be linked to DeepSeek, accessed large amounts of data through OpenAI’s application programming interface (API). The ChatGPT maker’s API allows software developers to license and use the company’s proprietary AI models into their own applications. However, the breach may have violated OpenAI’s terms of service and appeared to be an attempt to bypass restrictions on how much data can be accessed from the service. Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest investor, flagged the issue to the company, Bloomberg reports. Last week, the Hangzhou-based AI startup DeepSeek introduced its first-generation, open-source reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, that demonstrated comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models. The release prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks, with the Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P 500 all falling Monday morning. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA-1.25%) saw its stock plummet 17%, losing close to $600 billion in value — the largest single-day market cap loss ever for a U.S. company. At the same time, the mobile app for DeepSeek’s AI chatbot, also called DeepSeek, surged to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.34%) App Store, while its site experienced outages from an influx of new users. Investors were spooked by the Chinese startup, which released its DeepSeek-V3 model in December that it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. U.S. rivals such as OpenAI and Meta have touted spending tens of billions on Nvidia’s more powerful chips. The U.S. National Security Council is already reviewing the potential national security risks associated with DeepSeek, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday. Leavitt noted that President Donald Trump views the startup’s newly released AI model as a “wake-up call” for American developers. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

Title: Bitcoin And Crypto Are Braced For A Huge Fed Price Shock

01/30 update below. This post was originally published on January 29 Bitcoin and crypto prices have stabilized after teetering on the edge of another tumble yesterday, with traders still reeling from a sudden sell-off that sparked fears of a "financial crisis." Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price dropped sharply toward $100,000 before bouncing back to around $102,000 though bitcoin and crypto remain subdued despite BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealing a sovereign wealth fund bombshell. Now, as Coinbase's chief executive predicts when the bitcoin price could flip gold's $18 trillion, bitcoin and crypto traders are braced for the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision after U.S. president Donald Trump called for rates to come down sharply. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has called for Federal Reserve chair to lower interest rates by "a ... [+] lot"—something that many think would boost the bitcoin price and crypto market. The market is pricing in a near-100% certainty that the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will keep interest rates on hold, according to the CME Group FedWatch Tool, after cutting rates at each of its last three meetings. "The current [bitcoin price] lull can be attributed to risk aversion ahead of the Fed meeting," Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in an emailed note. 01/30 update: The bitcoin price and wider crypto market have climbed after the Federal Reserve followed through with its well-telegraphed pause of interest rate cuts yesterday, with the bitcoin price topping $105,000. Fed chair Jerome Powell's dovish comments that indicated he expects inflation to continue to ease helped push bitcoin and crypto prices higher. "Even with the U.S. Federal Reserve pursuing a ‘wait and see’ strategy on further interest rate cuts, bitcoin bulls have little reason to worry," Neil Roarty, cryptocurrency analyst at ClickOut Media, said in emailed comments. "The current 4.25% to 4.5% range is already proving low enough to sustain risk appetite, even if inflation is still higher than the Fed’s target. Bitcoin looks safe above the $100,000 watermark, and it could break higher over the coming months if Donald Trump pressures Jerome Powell into accelerating cuts, as he’s hinted he may. While bitcoin remains an attractive risk-on asset at current rates, a drop below 3% could flood markets with liquidity, further fueling speculation and pushing bitcoin into uncharted territory." Powell also opened the door for banks to start serving crypto companies, provided they take proper precautions. "Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they can understand and service the risks," Powell said at a press conference following the Fed's rate decision. Meanwhile, U.S. president Donald Trump criticized the Fed and Powell, accusing them of failing to get a handle on inflation and the economy and putting pressure on Powell to bring interest rates down through 2025. "Because Jay Powell and the Fed failed to stop the problem they created with inflation, I will do it by unleashing American energy production, slashing regulation, rebalancing international trade, and reigniting American manufacturing, but I will do much more than stopping inflation, I will make our country financially, and otherwise, powerful again," Trump posted to his Truth Social account. "The Fed has done a terrible job on bank regulation. Treasury is going to lead the effort to cut unnecessary regulation, and will unleash lending for all American people and businesses. If the Fed had spent less time on DEI, gender ideology, 'green' energy, and fake climate change, inflation would never have been a problem. Instead, we suffered from the worst inflation in the history of our country." The rate decision will be released Wednesday at 2pm ET, followed by the all-important press conference led by Fed chair Jerome Powell in which reporters will press him for a reaction to Trump's comments that interest rates should come down by "a lot." "I think I know interest rates much better than they do, and I think I know them certainly much better than the one who’s primarily in charge of making that decision," Trump said last week. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, helped by the Federal Reserve beginning its ... [+] interest rate cutting cycle. Last year, then-Republican candidate Trump said U.S. presidents should have a say over decisions made by the Fed, raising the possibility it could lose its independence. "We expect [Fed chair Powell] to be as diplomatic as is possible, while firmly committing to Fed independence," Ajay Rajadhyaksha, an economist at Barclays, wrote in a note seen by Axios. "Now that Trump has been calling quite vocally for lower interest rates, if the Fed eases monetary policy it will create the impression that they caved to him and forfeited their independence," Isabella Weber, economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told the Financial Times.

Thank you everyone. It’s fantastic to be here at Siemens at this amazing facility. Today, I want to talk about economic growth. Why it matters. How we achieve it. And what we are going to do further and faster to deliver it. Before we came into office… … the Prime Minister and I have said loud and clear: Economic growth is the number one mission of this government. Without growth, we cannot cut hospital waiting lists or put more police on the streets. Without growth, we cannot meet our climate goals… … or give the next generation the opportunities that they need to thrive. But most of all… … without economic growth… … we cannot improve the lives of ordinary working people. Because growth isn’t simply about lines on a graph. It’s about the pounds in people’s pockets. The vibrancy of our high streets. And the thriving businesses that create wealth, jobs and new opportunities for us, for our children, and grandchildren. We will have succeeded in our mission when working people are better off. I know that the cost of living crisis is still very real for many families across Britain. The sky high inflation and interest rates of the past few years have left a deep mark… … with too many people still making sacrifices to pay the bills and to pay their mortgages. But we have begun to turn this around. Everything I see as I travel around the country gives me more belief in Britain. And more optimism about our future. Because we as a country have huge potential. A country of strong communities, with small and local businesses at their heart. We are at the forefront of some of the most exciting developments in the world… … like artificial intelligence and life sciences… … with great companies like DeepMind, AstraZeneca, Rolls Royce… and of course Siemens… … delivering jobs and investment across Britain. We have fundamental strengths – in our history, in our language, and in our legal system – to compete in a global economy. But for too long, that potential has been held back. For too long, we have accepted low expectations and accepted decline. We no longer have to do that. We can do so much better. Low growth is not our destiny. But growth will not come without a fight. Without a government willing to take the right decisions now to change our country’s future for the better. That’s what our Plan for Change is all about. That is what drives me as Chancellor. In my Mais lecture in March last year, I set out my approach to achieving economic growth… … and identified the fundamental barriers to realising our full potential. The productive capacity of the UK economy has become far too weak. Productivity, the driver of living standards… …has grown more slowly here than in countries like Germany and the US. The supply side of our economy has suffered due to chronic underinvestment… … and stifling and unpredictable regulation… … not helped by the shocks we have faced in recent years. [redacted political content] The strategy that I have consistently set out… … is to grow the supply-side of our economy… … recognising that first and foremost… … it is businesses, investors and entrepreneurs who drive economic growth… … a government that systematically removes the barriers that they face – one by one and has their back This strategy has three essential elements: First, stability in our politics, our public finances and our economy - the basic condition for secure economic growth. Second, reform - reform which makes it easier for businesses to trade, to raise finance and to build. And third, investment, the lifeblood of economic growth. Let me explain each of those in turn. Stability – the first line of our manifesto was a promise to bring stability to the public finances. It is the rock upon which everything else is built. And it is the essential foundation of our Plan for Change. Because economic stability is the precondition for economic growth. That’s why the first piece of legislation that we passed as a government was the Budget Responsibility Act… … so never again will we see our independent forecaster sidelined. [redacted political content] At my first Budget in October… … it was my duty as Chancellor… … to fix the foundations of our economy, and repair the public finances that we inherited. To restore stability and create the conditions for growth and investment. I set out new fiscal rules which are non-negotiable, and will always be met. We began to rebuild our NHS and our schools – the start of a programme of public service reform. I capped the rate of corporation tax - and I extended our generous capital allowances for the duration of this parliament - as the CBI and the BCC have long called for. And I protected working people after a cost of living crisis… … by freezing fuel duty… … and with no increases in their National Insurance, Income Tax or VAT. But taking the right decisions and the responsible decisions does not always mean taking the easy decisions. The increase in Employers’ National Insurance contributions has consequences on business and beyond. I said that up front in my Budget speech. I accept that there are costs to responsibility. But the costs of irresponsibility would have been far higher. Those who oppose my Budget know that too. That is why, since October, I have seen no alternative put forward [redacted political content]. No alternatives to deal with the challenges we face. No alternatives to restoring economic stability… … and therefore no plan for driving economic growth. Alongside stability, we need to drive forward the reform which makes investment more likely… … by removing the constraints on the supply side of our economy… … making it easier for businesses to trade… … to raise finance… … and to build. Let me first address our approach to trade. We stand at a moment of global change. In that context, we should be guided by one clear principle above all. To act in the national interest… … for our economy… … for our businesses… … and for the British people. That means building on our special relationship with the United States under President Trump. The Prime Minister discussed the vital importance of growth with the President last weekend… … and I look forward to working with the new Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent… … to deepen our economic relationship in the months and the years ahead. Acting in our national interest also means resetting our relationship with the EU – our nearest and our largest trading partner – to drive growth and support business. We are pragmatic about the challenges that we have inherited from the last government’s failed Brexit deal. But we are also ambitious in our goals. [redacted political content] … we will prioritise proposals that are consistent with our manifesto commitments… … and which contribute to British growth and British prosperity… … because that is what the national interest demands. Our approach to trade also means building stronger relationships with fast-growing economies all around the world. That is why I led a delegation to China for the first Economic and Financial Dialogue since 2019… … alongside world-leading financial service businesses, including HSBC, Standard Chartered and Schroders… … unlocking £600 million of tangible benefits for the UK economy. And I am pleased to confirm that the Business and Trade Secretary will shortly visit India … … to restart talks on the free trade agreement and bilateral investment treaty [redacted political content]. Our businesses can only realise these opportunities if they can recruit the skilled staff that they need. So we are reforming our employment system to create a national jobs and careers service. We have created Skills England to meet the skills of the next decade in sectors like construction and engineering. And we will deliver fundamental reform of our welfare system. That includes looking at areas that have been ducked for too long… … like the rising cost of health and disability benefits… … and the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions will set out our plans to address this ahead of the Spring Statement. Next, the Immigration White Paper, that will bring forward concrete proposals to bring the overall levels of net migration down. But we know that the UK is in an international competition for talent in vital growth sectors. That is why last week, I set out plans for attracting global talent. We will look at the visa routes for very highly skilled people… … so the best people in the world choose the UK to live, work and create wealth… … bringing jobs and investment to Britain. To help businesses access the finance and support they need to grow… … we have delivered significant reforms to provide greater flexibility for firms and founders to raise finance on UK capital markets, by rewriting the UK’s listing rules. In my Mansion House speech, I announced a series of reforms to our pensions system… … including the creation of larger, consolidated funds… … which have much greater capacity to invest in high growth British companies at the scale that we need them to. The consultation on these reforms is already complete and the final report will be published in the Spring. Yesterday we confirmed that we have plans to go further, whilst always protecting the important role that pension funds play in the gilt market. We will introduce new flexibilities for well-funded Defined Benefit schemes… … to release surplus funds where it is safe to do so… … generating even more investment into some of our fastest growing industries. I know too that businesses are held back by a complex and unpredictable regulatory system… … and that is a drag on investment and innovation. We have already provided new growth-focused remits to our financial services regulators… … we have announced a new interim Chair of the Competition and Markets Authority… … and we have established the Regulatory Innovation Office, with an initial focus on synthetic biology, space, AI, and connected and autonomous vehicles. But we need to go further and we need to go faster. So earlier this month, I met the Heads of some of our largest regulators. They have already provided a range of options to drive growth in their sectors… … and proposals for how they can be more agile and responsive to businesses… … and we will publish that final action plan in March to make regulation work much better for our economy. To get Britain building again… … we have delivered the most significant reforms to our planning system in a generation. I have been genuinely shocked about how slow our planning system is. By how long it takes to get things done. Take the decision to build a solar farm in Cambridgeshire – a decision the Energy Secretary took only a few weeks into the job in July… [redacted political content] The Deputy Prime Minister has already driven significant progress across government in addressing these issues. My colleagues have determined 13 major planning decisions in just six months… … including for airports, data centres and major housing developments. We have significantly raised housing targets across our country and made them mandatory, so that we can build one-and-a-half million homes in this parliament. We have reformed decades-old “green belt” policies, making it easier to build on the “grey belt” land around our major cities. And we have opened up our planning system to build new infrastructure – like onshore wind farms or data centres driving the AI revolution. Having listened closely to calls from business groups like the Institute of Directors… … and businesses across our economy about the need to speed up infrastructure delivery… … including Mace, Skanska and Arup who are here today… … and members of our British Infrastructure Taskforce like Lloyds, Blackrock and Phoenix… … we have now set out plans to go even further. Last week we confirmed our priorities for the Planning and Infrastructure Bill … … to rapidly streamline the process for determining applications… … to make the consultation process far less burdensome… … and to fundamentally reform our approach to environmental regulation. The problems in our economy… … the lack of bold reform that we have seen over decades… … can be summed up by a £100 million bat tunnel built for HS2… … the type of decision that has made delivering major infrastructure in our country far too expensive and far too slow. So we are reducing the environmental requirements placed on developers when they pay into the nature restoration fund that we have created… …so they can focus on getting things built, and stop worrying about bats and newts. And to build our new infrastructure like nuclear power plants, trainlines and windfarms more quickly… … we are changing the rules to stop blockers getting in the way of development… … through excessive use of Judicial Review. This Bill, the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, is a priority for this government. It will be introduced in the Spring… … and we will work tirelessly in parliament to ensure its smooth, and speedy and rapid delivery. By providing a foundation of economic stability… … and by delivering the reforms needed to make it easier for businesses to succeed and grow… … we will create the right conditions to increase investment in our economy – the final key element of our strategy. Investment and innovation go hand in hand. I want to see the sounds and the sights of the future arriving. Delivered by amazing businesses like Wayve and Oxford Nanopore. They are the future. And Britain should be the best place in the world to be an entrepreneur. That is why we protected funding for research and development… … and it is why one of the first decisions I made as Chancellor… … was to extend the Enterprise Investment Scheme and the Venture Capital Trust schemes for a further 10 years… … to get more investment into new companies, driving their innovation and growth. I am determined to make Britain the best place in the world to invest. That was my message in Davos last week. That ambition demands action. The International Investment Summit that we hosted in October delivered £63 billion of investment right across our country… … from Iberdrola doubling its investment in clean energy in places like Suffolk… … Blackstone investing £10 billion in a data centre in Northumberland… … and Eren Holdings investing £1 billion in advanced manufacturing in North Wales. While the lifeblood of growth is business investment, a strategic state has a crucial role to play. That is why we established the National Wealth Fund… … to create that partnership between business, private investors and government to invest in the industries of the future… … like clean energy. Today I can announce two further investments by the National Wealth Fund. First, a £65 million investment for Connected Kerb, to expand their electric vehicle charging network across the UK. And second, a £28 million equity investment in Cornish Metals… … providing the raw materials to be used in solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles… … supporting growth and jobs in the South-West of England. There is no trade-off between economic growth and net zero. Quite the opposite. Net zero is the industrial opportunity of the 21st century, and Britain must lead the way. That is why we will publish a refreshed Carbon Budget Delivery Plan later this year, which alongside the Spending Review, will set out our plans to deliver Carbon Budget 6. Today, I can also announce that we are removing barriers to deliver 16 gigawatts of offshore wind… … by designating new Marine Protected Areas to enable the development of this technology in areas like East Anglia and Yorkshire… … crowding in up to £30 billion of investment in homegrown clean power. And there’s more. Our industrial and manufacturing base, brilliantly represented by Make UK, have been banging their heads against the wall for years at the lack of a proper industrial strategy from government. That is why we have launched our modern industrial strategy… … to drive investment into the industries that will define our success in the years ahead. We have already provided funding to unlock investment in sectors like aerospace, automotives and life sciences… … and we have set out reforms to boost financial services, the AI sector and creative industries. We are not wasting any time, and we will move forward with the next stages of the Industrial Strategy ahead of its publication in the Spring. We will work with the private sector to deliver the infrastructure that our country desperately needs. This includes the Lower Thames Crossing, which will improve connectivity at Port of Tilbury and Dover, London Gateway and Medway… … alleviating severe congestion… … as goods destined for export come from the North, and the Midlands and across the country to markets overseas. To drive growth and deliver value for money for taxpayers, we are exploring options to privately finance this important project. And we have changed course on public investment, too… … with a new Investment Rule to ensure that we don’t just count the costs of investment – we count the benefits too. We are now investing 2.6% of GDP on average over the next five years, compared to 1.9% planned by the previous government.. … delivering an additional £100 billion of growth-enhancing capital spending… … which catalyses private sector investment… … in more housing… … better transport links… … and clean energy. These are significant steps in just six months… … and we are seeing some encouraging signs in the British economy. The IMF have upgraded our growth prospects for 2025… … the only G7 country outside the US to see this happen. This gives us the fastest growth of any major European economy this year. And a global survey of CEOs by PWC, has shown Britain is now the second most attractive country in the world for businesses looking to invest. The first time the UK has been in that position for 28 years. This is all welcome news. But there is still more that we can and will do. I am not satisfied with the position we are in. While we have huge amounts of potential, the structural problems in our economy run deep. And the low growth of the last 14 years cannot just be turned around overnight. This has to be our focus for the duration of the parliament. Because the situation demands us to do more. And today I will go further and faster in kickstarting economic growth. Our mission to grow our economy is about raising living standards in every single part of the United Kingdom. Manchester is home to the UK’s fastest growing tech sector. Leeds is one of the largest financial services centres outside of London. These great northern cities have so much potential and promise… …which our brilliant metro mayors, Andy Burnham and Tracy Brabin, are working hard to realise… … just like our other metro mayors are doing to deliver new opportunities in their areas. And there is so much more that government can do to support our city regions. To achieve this requires greater focus on two key areas: infrastructure and investment. If we can improve connectivity between towns and cities across the North of England, we can unlock their true growth potential… … by making it easier for people to live, travel and work across the area. At the Budget, I set out funding for the Transpennine Route Upgrade… … a multi-billion-pound programme of improvements that will connect towns and cities from Manchester to York via Stalybridge, Leeds and Huddersfield. We are delivering railway schemes to improve journeys for people across the North… … including upgrades at Bradford Forster Square and by electrifying the Wigan-Bolton line. We have committed to supporting the delivery of a new mass transit system in West Yorkshire. And in Spring, we will publish the Spending Review and a 10-Year Infrastructure Strategy… … which will set out further detail of our plans for infrastructure right across the UK. New transport infrastructure can also act as a catalyst for new housing. We have already seen the benefits that unlocking untapped land around stations can deliver in places like Stockport… … where joint work spearheaded by Andy Burnham and council leaders has delivered new housing and wider commercial opportunities. We will introduce a new approach to planning decisions on land around stations, changing the default answer to yes. We are working with the devolved governments to ensure the benefits of growth can be felt across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland… … including by partnering with them on the Industrial Strategy to support their considerable sectoral strengths. And in December, I met with Metro Mayors from across England. They told me that more opportunities for investment are vital if their local economies are to grow in the years ahead. We are listening closely to them. As the Metro Mayor of Liverpool, Steve Rotherham, has called for… … we will review the Green Book and how it is being used to provide objective, transparent advice on public investment across the country, including outside London and the Southeast. This means that investment in all regions is given a fair hearing by the Treasury that I lead. The Office for Investment is going to be working hand in hand with local areas… … to develop a commercially attractive pipeline of investment opportunities for a global audience… … starting with the Liverpool City Region and the North East Combined Authority, led by Kim McGuinness. The National Wealth Fund is establishing strategic partnerships to provide deeper, more focused support for city regions, starting in Glasgow, West Yorkshire, the West Midlands, and Greater Manchester. We are supporting key investment opportunities across the UK. The government is backing Andy Burnham’s plans for the redevelopment of Old Trafford, which promises to create new housing and commercial development around a new stadium… … to drive regeneration and growth in the area. We are moving forward with the Wrexham and Flintshire Investment Zone… … focusing on the area’s strengths in advanced manufacturing… … backed by major businesses like Airbus and JCB… … to leverage £1 billion of private investment in the next ten years… … creating up to 6,000 jobs. [redacted political content] So I can announce today that we will work with Doncaster Council and the Mayor of South Yorkshire, Oliver Coppard… … to support their efforts to recreate South Yorkshire Airport City as a thriving regional airport. And finally, I am pleased to announce a partnership between Prologis and Manchester Airport Group in the East Midlands, where the Metro Mayor Claire Ward is doing an excellent job growing the local economy there. Prologis and MAG will work together to build a new advanced manufacturing and logistics park at East Midlands Airport … … unlocking up to £1 billion of investment and 2,000 jobs at the site… … a major investment from a global business into our country… … representing a huge vote of confidence in the East Midlands and in the UK. This is just the start of our work to get more investment into every nation and region of Britain. Next, I want to set out further detail for plans for the area we are in today. Oxford and Cambridge offer huge potential for our nation’s growth prospects. Only 66 miles apart… … these cities are home to two of the best universities in the world… … and the area is a hub for globally renowned science and technology firms. This area has the potential to be Europe’s Silicon Valley. To make that a reality, we need a systematic approach to attract businesses to come here and to grow here. At the moment, it takes over two and a half hours to travel between Oxford and Cambridge by train. There is no way to commute directly by rail from places like Bedford and Milton Keynes to Cambridge. And there is a lack of affordable housing right across the region. In other words, the demand is there… … but there are far too many supply side constraints on economic growth here. We are going to fix that. The Ox Cam arc was initially launched in 2003 – over 20 years ago. [redacted political content] We are not prepared to miss out on the opportunities here any longer. So working with the Deputy Prime Minister… … who is already driving forward vital work in the region… … we are going further and faster to unlock the potential of the Oxford-Cambridge Growth Corridor. First, we are funding the transport links needed to make the Oxford Cambridge growth corridor a success… … including East-West Rail, with new services between Oxford and Milton Keynes starting this year… … and road upgrades to reduce journey times between Milton Keynes and Cambridge. East West Rail will also support vibrant new and expanded communities along the route. We have already received proposals for New Towns along the new railway… … with 18 submissions for sizeable new developments. At Tempsford – the nexus of the East Coast Mainline, the A1 and East West Rail… …we will move quicker to deliver a mainline station, meaning journey times to London of under an hour… … and to Cambridge in under 30 minutes when East West Rail is operational. Second, we are ensuring that the area has the right infrastructure and public services in place to support the growth corridor as it expands. A new Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital is being prioritised for investment as part of wave 1 of the New Hospital Programme. Water infrastructure has also been a major hindrance to development. So we have now agreed water resources management plans, unlocking £7.9 billion of investment in the next 5 years… …including plans for the new Fens Reservoir serving Cambridge and the South East Strategic Reservoir near Oxford. And I can confirm today that the Environment Agency have now lifted their objections to new development in Cambridge, following this government’s intervention to address water scarcity… … which means 4,500 additional homes, new schools, and new office, retail and laboratory space can be built. Third, I am delighted that Cambridge University have come forward with plans for a new flagship innovation hub at the centre of Cambridge… … to attract global investment and foster a community that catalyses innovation, as other cities around the world like Boston and Paris have done. Just yesterday, Moderna completed the build for their new vaccine production and R&D site in Harwell, right here in Oxfordshire, alongside a commitment to invest a further £1 billion in the UK. And we are creating a new AI Growth Zone in Culham to speed up planning approvals for the rapid build-out of data centres. And finally, to take this project forward at real pace… … and catalyse private sector investment into the region… … I am pleased to announce that the Deputy Prime Minister and I have asked Lord Patrick Vallance to be the champion for the Oxford Cambridge Growth Corridor. Lord Vallance has extensive experience across the sciences, academia, and government. He will work with local leaders and with the Housing and Planning Minister to deliver this exciting project… … including with Peter Freeman, who is already doing excellent work in Cambridge… … and a new Growth Commission for Oxford, which will help to accelerate growth in the city and its surrounding area. This is the government’s modern Industrial Strategy in action. With central government, local leaders and business working together… … the Oxford and Cambridge Growth Corridor could add up to £78 billion to the UK economy by 2035 … … driving investment, innovation and growth. Finally, I come to the decision that perhaps more than any other… … has been delayed… … has been avoided… … has been ducked. The question of whether to give Heathrow … … our only hub airport… … a third runway… … has run on for decades. The last full length runway in Britain was built in the 1940s. No progress in eighty years. Why is this so damaging? It’s because Heathrow is at the heart of the UK’s openness as a country. It connects us to emerging markets all over the world, opening up new opportunities for growth. Around three-quarters of all long-haul flights in the UK go from Heathrow. Over 60% of UK air freight comes through Heathrow. And about 15 million business travellers used Heathrow in 2023. But for decades, its growth has been constrained. Successive studies have shown that this really matters for our economy. According to the most recent study from Frontier Economics, a third runway could increase potential GDP by 0.43% by 2050. Over half – 60% of that boost, would go to areas outside London and the South-East. … increasing trade opportunities for products like Scotch whiskey and Scottish salmon - already two of the biggest British exports out of Heathrow. And a third runway could create over 100,000 jobs. For international investors, persistent delays have cast doubt about our seriousness towards improving our economic prospects. Business groups, like the CBI, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Chambers of Commerce right across the UK… …as well trade unions like GMB and Unite are clear… … a third runway is badly needed. In 2018, the previous government steered its Airports National Policy Statement through parliament. But no action was taken. It simply sat on the shelf. We are taking a totally different approach to airport expansion. This Government has already given its support to expansion at City Airport and at Stansted. And there are two live decisions on Luton and Gatwick which will be made by the Transport Secretary shortly. But as our only hub airport, Heathrow is in a unique position - and we cannot duck the decision any longer. I have always been clear that a third runway at Heathrow would unlock further growth… … boost investment… … increase exports… … and make the UK more open and more connected. And now, the case is stronger than ever… … because our reforms to the economy… … like speeding up the planning system… … and our plans for modernised UK airspace… … mean the delivery of this project is set up for success. So I can confirm today that this Government supports a third runway at Heathrow… … and is inviting proposals to be brought forward by the summer. We will then take forward a full assessment through the Airport National Policy Statement. That will ensure that the project is value for money - and our clear expectation is that any associated surface transport costs will be financed through private funding. And it will ensure that a third runway is delivered in line with our legal, environmental and climate obligations. Heathrow themselves are clear that their proposal for expansion will meet strict rules on noise, air quality and carbon emissions. And we are already making great strides in transitioning to cleaner and greener aviation. Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuel by around 70%. At the start of this month, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate became law. And today I can announce that we are investing £63 million into the Advanced Fuels Fund over the next year… … and we have today set out the details of how we will deliver a Revenue Certainty Mechanism to encourage investment into this growing industry. These measures will encourage more investors to back production in the UK, bringing good, high-skilled jobs to areas like Teesside… … demonstrating that investment in the right technology can help us deliver both our growth and our clean energy missions. Now is the moment to grasp the opportunity in front of us. By backing a third runway at Heathrow, we can make Britain the world’s best connected place to do business. That is what it takes to make bold decisions in the national interest. That is what I mean by going further and faster to kickstart economic growth. The work of change has begun. We have already made great progress. But I am not satisfied. And I know that there is more to be done. We must go further and faster if we are to build a brighter future. The prize on offer is immense. The next generation with more opportunities than the last. An engineer in Teesside, working in some of the most exciting industries of the future – from carbon capture to sustainable aviation fuel. A scientist in Milton Keynes or Bedford, working in our life sciences industry to solve some of the most important medical challenges in the world. A small business owner in Scotland, knowing that they can expand and export to new markets right across the globe. Wealth created, and wealth shared, in every part of Britain. This is a Government on the side of working people. Taking the right decisions to secure their future, to secure our future. Stepping up to the challenges we face. Ending the era of low expectations. Putting Britain on a different path. Delivering for the British people. And I am determined, this Government is determined, to do just that. Thank you.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Uber-backed Moove, an Africa-born mobility fintech that offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers across six continents, has acquired Kovi, a Brazilian urban mobility provider. The value of the deal is not being disclosed, but Moove confirmed it was an all-share transaction, and Kovi is now wholly owned by Moove. Moove co-founder and co-CEO Ladi Delano told TechCrunch that the deal bumps the mobility fintech’s annual revenue to $275 million. Last March, Moove reported a $115 million ARR. The news comes two months after Moove announced a partnership with Waymo to provide driverless vehicle fleet operations in two U.S. cities, Phoenix and Miami. Delano said Moove’s acquisition of the São Paulo-based Kovi marks a significant step toward the company’s goal of building the world’s largest rideshare fleet. What began with 76 cars in Lagos, Nigeria, in 2020 has now grown to 36,000 cars operating in 19 cities across six continents, with Latin America now emerging as a key market. Similarly, the acquisition unites two companies tackling the same challenge — providing financing solutions for rideshare drivers. Founded in 2018, Y Combinator-backed Kovi launched to make vehicle ownership more accessible in Brazil. Following the acquisition, pending approval from the Brazilian antitrust authority, Kovi will continue to operate under its brand while its executive and management teams will remain unchanged. While Moove will keep the Kovi brand operating in its existing markets, Brazil and Mexico, there are plans to expand further across Latin America. Moove recently launched operations in three cities across Colombia and Mexico. As such, the acquisition further cements Moove’s position in Latin America, giving the company a major foothold in Brazil, the region’s largest ride-hail market. “We’re incredibly excited about working with a fantastic team of like-minded individuals at Kovi who set up this business to address a similar problem that we found in Nigeria,” he remarked. “Kovi is one of the top two players in Brazil. So we have not just entered or strengthened our presence in the Latin American market but also put ourselves in a top-two position in the largest single market in Latin America through this acquisition.” Moove has built a third pillar in the global mobility marketplace by offering vehicle supply to ride-hailing platforms. This includes its flagship Drive-to-Own product, a taxi and employment model, and an emerging autonomous vehicle (AV) business line involving AI-driven mobility. While AI plays a key role in its AV business line, Delano says the company’s AI mobility strategy will span the entire business, from optimizing traditional ride-hailing services to improving fleet management, according to Delano. This is where the Kovi acquisition comes in. According to the chief executive, Kovi’s proprietary technology and algorithms will “complement and strengthen our existing Moove AI mobility strategy and ensure that we can start to deliver an improved service and product to our customers around the world.” It’s unclear whether Kovi was struggling financially before its acquisition by Moove. Its last known funding round was a $104 million Series B in 2021 from investors like Valor Capital, Prosus Ventures, and Quona Capital. Despite raising funds to expand across Latin America, Kovi primarily focused on Brazil. That year, it reported $45 million in ARR, growing 15% month-over-month. The all-share transaction makes Kovi’s investors shareholders in Moove, aligning their growth trajectories. In a statement, Kovi CEO Adhemar Milani Neto expressed confidence in the deal. “I met the founders [Moove’s Delano and Jide Odunsi] many years back when they were scaling their business in Africa, and I was immediately impressed by their purpose-driven approach, which is also a perfect match to our culture. Together, I believe we will become a truly global category-defining business and will leverage scale and deep expertise never seen in our market.” Moove raised a $100 million Uber-led Series B last year at a $750 million valuation. The mobility fintech has secured over $500 million in debt and equity from backers like Mubadala, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Janus Henderson, and the IFC (World Bank) since its launch five years ago. Delano declined to comment on potential new fundraising efforts. Instead, he stressed that the company will focus on driving its capex-heavy business to profitability this year and realizing its vision of building the largest ride-hailing fleet globally.

There’s a new kid on the block, and his name is DeepSeek. Right now, there are tons of questions going around about this break-out star of the AI world. Well, if you want to know more about DeepSeek, here’s a guide on what you need to know about it. This article will be updated as time goes on, so you should feel free to check back every now and then. At the time of writing this piece, new developments are coming at us left and right, so you should expect to see updates to this piece fairly often. We’ll go over the things you should know and be aware of with this new AI tool. There’s also a crucial bit of information that you should be aware of. Table of Contents First, let’s start off with something pretty basic; what the heck is DeepSeek? Well, it’s a new AI chatbot. It’s just like Google Gemini, OpenAI ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, and other chatbots. It gives you text-based responses based on input. Several people have done studies, and they found that its responses can challenge ChatGPT’s and Google Gemini’s. This makes it a pretty big threat to these companies. The company was formed in 2023. It is owned by the Chinese hedge fund named High-Flyer. DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, also co-founded High-Flyer. He is the acting CEO. DeepSeek used the model named DeepSeek-V3. This model has 671 billion total parameters. It also has a context window of 128K, which is far behind the likes of Gemini, but it’s pretty average compared to other models. Currently, DeepSeek uses the model called R1. This is the model that made waves throughout the AI industry. This model also has 671 billion parameters and a 128K context window. According to a user on Reddit, the DeepSeek website limits you to just 50 messages. However, the company states that there aren’t any rate limits on the DeepSeek API. This could be because it’s cheaper to use than many other models on the market. There are two main ways to do so. Firstly, you can go to the official DeepSeek website. For mobile users, you can download the app from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. Signing up for DeepSeek is pretty simple, and it’s no different from most other services. There are a couple of options. You can either provide your email address or phone number along with a password. The other option is to sign in with your Google account. Nothing. DeepSeek is free to download and use. For the time being, it does not. It has an input cost of $0.55 and an output cost of $2.19 per million tokens. This is better than models like GPT-4o (input:$2.50 output: $10.00) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (input: $1.25 output: $5.00). Yes. This is something that differentiates it from Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT models. In case you don’t know, a multimodal model is one that can understand and create multiple forms of media. For example, a model that can generate both images and text is multimodal. It’s the same thing for a model that can both understand images and text. DeepSeek R1 is not a multimodal model. However, the company does have a model called Janus Pro. It unveiled this model not too long ago. Janus Pro has the ability to both understand and generate text and images. So, if you want to ask it questions based on an image, you can upload an image as the prompt. Also, you can use it as an image generator just like DALL-E. Janus Pro is the successor to Janus, and the company showed a comparison between the two models. Janus Pro is available to download from the company’s Hugging Face page. This is one of the most significant aspects of this chatbot. According to an analysis from Artificial Analysis, DeepSeek is a formidable model. In terms of speed, it’s pretty slow compared to the rest of the competition, but it makes up for it in raw performance. Based on several tests, DeepSeek R1 was able to best OpenAI’s GPT-4o in different areas. The graph below shows the quality rating of the top AI models on the market. We see that DeepSeek R1 (89 points) is just one point behind OpenAI’s o1 model (90 points), the company’s most advanced reasoning model. However, it was able to best o1-mini (84 points), GPT-4o (73 points), and GPT-4o mini (73 points). It was also able to beat our Google’s most advanced models Gemini 2.0 Experimental (82 points) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (80 points). The rest of the list is populated by models from Meta, Anthropic, Amazon, and Mistral. The next graph comes from DeepSeek’s Github. It shows DeepSeek R1’s performance compared to OpenAI’s o1, a previous version of R1, and DeepSeek-V3. As you can see, it was able to trade blows with the best that OpenAI has to offer. So, all in all, it’s no surprise that DeepSeek was able to make such a splash in the AI space. It came out of nowhere and brought a model that should put AI veterans like Google and OpenAI on their toes. From what we can tell, DeepSeek is available in the U.S. and China. We’re certain it’s available in other regions as well. That is a doozy of a question. Honestly, this might be the longest section of this piece. We’re not going to sugarcoat this, DeepSeek gathers an absolute TON of information about you AND it stores that data on a server in mainland China. If this is something that you do not want to happen, then we suggest that you do not download or sign up for DeepSeek. The list of information it gathers on you is rather long. DeepSeek directly informs people that it gathers information like: Yes. The company explains that it may share your information with advertisers, other entities within its corporate group, and other groups as the result of a merger, change of control, reorganization, financing, sale of assets, or acquisition. This means that, once DeepSeek has your data, there’s no telling how many hands it will change along its journey. What makes the situation worse is the fact that DeepSeek holds on to your data indefinitely. As per the privacy page, it retains your data “for as long as necessary,“. This means that your data could be stored on the company’s servers for years. At least Google has a hard cut-off date for how long it keeps your data. Yes. The company says so on its privacy policy page. “We may share information collected through your use of the Service with our advertising or analytics partners.” Information being sold to advertisers is nothing new, but with all of the information that DeepSeek scoops up, it shines a harsh light on the company. Unfortunately, no. DeepSeek states that some of the information it gathers is taken automatically, so there’s no to control it. Also, if you delete your account, the company does not state whether your content will be deleted or if it will live on in the servers. DeepSeek does, however, give you at least SOME control over our data, but it’s extremely limiting. Through the settings, you’re allowed to erase your chat history. Next, you can go to your browser and disable browser cookies. You’ll need to do this in your browser’s general settings, not on the DeepSeek website. At this point, it’s tough to say. TikTok was nearly booted from the United States because the information it took from users resided in China. We don’t know all of the information that TikTok stored, but we’re sure it wasn’t as extreme as DeepSeek. Since DeepSeek is taking so much data from the people who use it, we’re most certain that some governmental entity will find an issue with it and move to bring legal action. It hasn’t happened yet, but this article will be updated if something like that happens. At the time of writing this, DeepSeek has had a bit of a rippling effect in the AI company world. Obviously, top AI companies like Meta, Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic are wary of the potential completion. However, there’s more to this story. As of the time this article comes out (late January 2025), several major tech companies have seen a pretty notable drop in their stock prices. The largest drop happened with Nvidia. In 2024, the company saw a meteoric rise in the stock market as companies bought thousands upon thousands of its chips. It reached an over $2 trillion market value. However, in the wake of DeepSeek, its prices dropped a whopping $596.7 billion in the market in just one day. Nvidia isn’t the only company that dropped a bunch in the market. Other companies that lost hard are: Those are the top 10 biggest losers in the market, including Nvidia. Altogether, those companies lost north of a trillion dollars in market value in one day. That’s a pretty massive drop. The thing is that training and maintaining AI models is a costly business. We’re not just talking about money, it also eats up energy like it’s no one’s business. This is why companies like Meta and Microsoft are trying to build nuclear plants. However, DeepSeek comes onto the scene with a model that costs a fraction of the money and energy to maintain. Also, it’s able to run on weaker chips. This crushed the disillusion that powerful AI needed powerful chips, a bunch of money, and a ton of energy to nurture. So, many of the people who were investing in large tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia lost faith that their money was being put to the right use. Remember, it’s been able to beat OpenAI’s most powerful model on some tests. Many of the people who invested in these companies sold off their stocks, which led to a bit of a crash. As you can imagine, Nvidia was hit the hardest because it was one of the main companies supplying powerful chips to AI companies across the nation. The company to lose the second most value, Broadcom, is a chipmaker as well, and people investing in it also took their dollars elsewhere. Many of the top AI companies in the U.S. have seen a large dip in their stock price and at this point, we don’t know how long this is going to go on for. We’re sure it won’t be long before other companies like Google, OpenAI, Meta, and others start to feel the effects of this. At this point, we’re not sure what the company is planning. The company does have an API available, so we know that it wants other AI platforms to use its models. As popular as it has become, we’re sure that numerous services will rise using its API.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tech led stocks lower on Wednesday morning as the broader mood stayed muted ahead of the first Big Tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell more 0.7%, after a bounce-back rally on Tuesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down about 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was roughly flat. The looming Fed policy verdict is providing reason for markets to tread carefully, even though the central bank is expected to stand pat on interest rates. Investors will listen for answers to two key questions at Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference: How much further will the Fed cut rates and has the central bank changed its stance in light of President Trump's early tariff moves? Meanwhile, a surprise rise in bookings for ASML (ASML), a key toolmaker in the AI chip chain, gave another boost to techs starting to recover from a bruising start to the week. Shares of ASML popped 5% in early trading, with peers like Applied Materials (AMAT) also making gains. Nvidia (NVDA), however, didn't catch a boost, with shares down nearly 5%, as its Tuesday comeback faltered. Markets are now taking a cooler look at Chinese startup DeepSeek's challenge to assumptions about AI spending and costs. Shares of Alibaba (BABA) moved up more than 4% after the Chinese tech giant released a new AI model that it said is better than DeepSeek's rival to ChatGPT. The saga deepened with claims by Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI that DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train its competitor. The spotlight is now on the guidance in Meta (META) and Microsoft's quarterly results, due after the bell, for reassurance that Big Tech's heavy AI spending will pay off in growth. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out Wednesday's megacap earnings, with Wall Street watching for a new catalyst to jump-start the stock. Starbucks (SBUX) shares are up more than 5% after reporting quarterly results. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports: Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol is promising more caffeinated growth but isn't yet ready to put hard projections around when. And for now, that continues to be enough for Wall Street. On its earnings call, the company highlighted improved sequential sales trends in the US as it worked to speed up mobile orders and end upcharging for dairy substitutes, among other changes. "I think we're definitely in the middle of a turnaround," Niccol said on Yahoo Finance. Read more here. It's been a whipsaw week of trading action for AI leader Nvidia (NVDA). The stock lost a record $589 billion in market cap on Monday, with shares falling roughly 17% as a new artificial intelligence model from China's DeepSeek raised questions about AI investment and the rise of more cost-efficient AI agents. Then Tuesday brought a rebound, with the stock closing 9% higher. But Wednesday's early action saw the the stock fall nearly 4%. That shows the AI chipmaker isn't out of the woods yet, as investors await earnings results from key Nvidia customers after the bell in Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA). ASML (ASML) stock rose 6% early Wednesday after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips. ASML sells highly complex machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses those machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights. The Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of 6.85 euros ($7.12), ahead of the 6.68 euros expected. Its quarterly revenue of 9.2 billion euros topped the 9 billion euros forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. ASML also posted stronger-than-expected order bookings, reflecting strong demand from AI chipmakers for its advanced tools. Meanwhile, its CEO Christophe Fouquet told CNBC in an interview about the impact of DeepSeek's new AI models: “We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand." Read the full story here. Stocks wavered on Wednesday morning with the broader mood muted ahead of the first Big Tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's rate decision. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell more than 0.3%, after a bounce-back rally on Tuesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down about 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was just above the flat line. The looming Fed policy verdict is providing reason for markets to tread carefully, even though the central bank is expected to stand pat on interest rates. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) shares rose nearly 15% in premarket trading after the company linked to President Donald Trump announced an expansion into financial services. The operator of Truth Social will launch a financial services and fintech brand dubbed "Truth.Fi." The board approved a $250 million investment of its cash reserves into customized separately managed accounts (SMAs), customized exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as bitcoin (BTC-USD) and similar cryptocurrencies or crypto-related securities. "We began by creating a free-speech social media platform, added an ultra-fast TV streaming service, and now we're moving into investment products and decentralized finance," TMTG CEO and chairman Devin Nunes said in the release. "Developing American First investment vehicles is another step toward our goal of creating a robust ecosystem through which American patriots can protect themselves from the ever-present threat of cancellation, censorship, debanking, and privacy violations committed by Big Tech and woke corporations." Oppenheimer has joined its peers at Loop Capital and Jefferies in cutting its rating on shares of Apple (AAPL) in the run-up to the company's fiscal first quarter results, due out after the bell tomorrow. OpCo cut its rating on Apple to Perform from Outperform, according to a report from Bloomberg, with the firm citing slowing iPhone sales and a lack of AI innovation, similar cases to those made by Loop and Jefferies last week. On Monday, Apple was a market leader amid a washout in AI-related plays, most notably Nvidia (NVDA), which lost nearly $600 billion in market value. This was a silver lining of sorts during a period in which the company has been a notable laggard relative to its peers in deploying AI across its product line. And with Apple set to report results for its holiday quarter on Thursday — its most important quarter of the year for iPhone sales — Wall Street is bracing its clients for a mild disappointment.

Markets are now taking a cooler look at Chinese startup DeepSeek's challenge to assumptions about AI spending and costs. Shares of Alibaba (BABA) moved up more than 4% after the Chinese tech giant released a new AI model that it said is better than DeepSeek's rival to ChatGPT. The saga deepened with claims by Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI that DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train its competitor. The spotlight is now on the guidance in Meta (META) and Microsoft's quarterly results, due after the bell, for reassurance that Big Tech's heavy AI spending will pay off in growth. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out Wednesday's megacap earnings, with Wall Street watching for a new catalyst to jump-start the stock. Nvidia (NVDA) stock tanked on Monday, falling more than 17% and losing nearly $600 billion off its market cap, as investors digested a new cost-effective artificial intelligence model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. But retail investors bought the dip. Data from VandaTrack shows retail investors bought more than $562 million of the name on Monday, the largest single day inflow into the stock in VandaTrack's data. On Tuesday, as the stock rebounded and rose roughly 9%, there was once again a large swath of retail buying totaling nearly $360 million. Across the two days of chaotic market action, retail investors sent more than $920 million into shares of Nvidia. Wall street strategists largely agreed with retail's bullish outlook on the name. "We think this is probably going to end up a buy the dip Nvidia moment," Fundstrat head of Research Tom Lee said in a video to clients on Monday night. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon told Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith the DeepSeek driven sell-off was "overblown." Rasgon added that the new developments don't spell out "doomsday for AI infrastructure." Starbucks (SBUX) shares are up more than 5% after reporting quarterly results. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports: Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol is promising more caffeinated growth but isn't yet ready to put hard projections around when. And for now, that continues to be enough for Wall Street. On its earnings call, the company highlighted improved sequential sales trends in the US as it worked to speed up mobile orders and end upcharging for dairy substitutes, among other changes. "I think we're definitely in the middle of a turnaround," Niccol said on Yahoo Finance. Read more here. It's been a whipsaw week of trading action for AI leader Nvidia (NVDA). The stock lost a record $589 billion in market cap on Monday, with shares falling roughly 17% as a new artificial intelligence model from China's DeepSeek raised questions about AI investment and the rise of more cost-efficient AI agents. Then Tuesday brought a rebound, with the stock closing 9% higher. But Wednesday's early action saw the the stock fall nearly 4%. That shows the AI chipmaker isn't out of the woods yet, as investors await earnings results from key Nvidia customers after the bell in Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA). ASML (ASML) stock rose 6% early Wednesday after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips. ASML sells highly complex machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses those machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights. The Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of 6.85 euros ($7.12), ahead of the 6.68 euros expected. Its quarterly revenue of 9.2 billion euros topped the 9 billion euros forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. ASML also posted stronger-than-expected order bookings, reflecting strong demand from AI chipmakers for its advanced tools. Meanwhile, its CEO Christophe Fouquet told CNBC in an interview about the impact of DeepSeek's new AI models: “We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand." Read the full story here. Stocks wavered on Wednesday morning with the broader mood muted ahead of the first Big Tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's rate decision. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell more than 0.3%, after a bounce-back rally on Tuesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down about 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was just above the flat line. The looming Fed policy verdict is providing reason for markets to tread carefully, even though the central bank is expected to stand pat on interest rates. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) shares rose nearly 15% in premarket trading after the company linked to President Donald Trump announced an expansion into financial services. The operator of Truth Social will launch a financial services and fintech brand dubbed "Truth.Fi." The board approved a $250 million investment of its cash reserves into customized separately managed accounts (SMAs), customized exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as bitcoin (BTC-USD) and similar cryptocurrencies or crypto-related securities. "We began by creating a free-speech social media platform, added an ultra-fast TV streaming service, and now we're moving into investment products and decentralized finance," TMTG CEO and chairman Devin Nunes said in the release. "Developing American First investment vehicles is another step toward our goal of creating a robust ecosystem through which American patriots can protect themselves from the ever-present threat of cancellation, censorship, debanking, and privacy violations committed by Big Tech and woke corporations." Oppenheimer has joined its peers at Loop Capital and Jefferies in cutting its rating on shares of Apple (AAPL) in the run-up to the company's fiscal first quarter results, due out after the bell tomorrow. OpCo cut its rating on Apple to Perform from Outperform, according to a report from Bloomberg, with the firm citing slowing iPhone sales and a lack of AI innovation, similar cases to those made by Loop and Jefferies last week. On Monday, Apple was a market leader amid a washout in AI-related plays, most notably Nvidia (NVDA), which lost nearly $600 billion in market value. This was a silver lining of sorts during a period in which the company has been a notable laggard relative to its peers in deploying AI across its product line. And with Apple set to report results for its holiday quarter on Thursday — its most important quarter of the year for iPhone sales — Wall Street is bracing its clients for a mild disappointment.

Title: Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK): Is This Healthcare Stock A Good Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Retirement Stock Portfolio: 10 Healthcare Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other healthcare stocks. Healthcare stocks are widely considered a cornerstone of a retirement portfolio due to their resilience, long-term growth potential, and ability to provide steady income through dividends. This sector encompasses pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers, biotechnology firms, and medical device manufacturers, all of which are positioned to benefit from enduring trends like aging populations and advancements in medical technology. One of the most compelling reasons to include health stocks in a retirement portfolio is their defensive nature. Health care is a necessity, not a luxury, meaning demand for medical products and services remains steady, even during economic downturns. According to a report by Morningstar, the healthcare sector outperformed the broader market in 75% of US recessions over the past 50 years, demonstrating its ability to provide stability when other sectors falter. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Global demographic trends also favor health stocks. The United Nations projects that the number of people aged 65 and older will double by 2050, reaching 1.5 billion. This aging population will drive increased demand for chronic disease management, prescription medications, and long-term care services. The US alone spends over $4.3 trillion annually on health care, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, accounting for nearly 20% of GDP. This figure is expected to rise to $6.8 trillion by 2030, driven by advances in medical technology and higher spending on aging-related health issues. Health stocks, particularly those of established pharmaceutical companies, often provide attractive dividend yields, making them ideal for income-focused retirees. Drug giants are known for consistently paying and increasing dividends. Dividends provide retirees with regular income, reducing the need to sell assets during market downturns. The healthcare sector is also at the forefront of technological innovation, offering exposure to high-growth areas such as biotechnology, precision medicine, and artificial intelligence in healthcare. Healthcare stocks provide diversification in a retirement portfolio as well, balancing out more volatile sectors like technology or energy. Additionally, healthcare ETFs like the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund offer exposure to a wide range of companies, spreading risk while capturing growth potential. For example, Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund has delivered a 10-year annualized return of 13.4%, outperforming many other sectors. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected health stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) operates as a healthcare company worldwide. There are several aspects that make this company an attractive investment choice. Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) has achieved 14 consecutive years of dividend growth, surpassing the sector median of 2 years by 600%. Secondly, the company has also maintained 35 consecutive years of dividend payments, outperforming the sector median of 15 years by 133.33%. This shows the company’s ability to generate profit and provide value to its shareholders, which are indicators of strong financial growth. Moreover, Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) has also announced a $17 million commitment over five years (2025-2030) to advance equitable access to culturally responsive care for people with heart conditions in the US communities. Overall MRK ranks 3rd on our list of the healthcare stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), the Cheap AI Stock to Buy in 2025?

We recently published a list of 12 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other cheap AI stocks to buy in 2025. Artificial Intelligence (AI) was a buzzword around Wall Street for most of 2024. AI has shown immense promise but comes with significant risks. Big AI players are dominating the broader market, but there will be opportunities for other companies to explore as the AI market continues to expand. For instance, the new administration is keen on technological advancement, and recently, President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion AI initiative, a joint venture known as Stargate between OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle. However, DeepSeek’s introduction shocked the U.S. companies after it released a new AI model, a much better alternative to GPT-4. DeepSeek claims to have designed the AI model in just two months and at around under $6 million using Nvidia’s less-advanced H800 chips, as reported by Reuters on January 27. Since the news broke out, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have plunged over 16%, wiping away $600 billion in market capitalization, the biggest one-day loss in U.S. history. Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead, speaking to Market Domination, shared his views on DeepSeek. Moorhead was impressed by the efficiency of DeepSeek’s AI. He pointed out that the Chinese have used different techniques compared to American developers, where they were able to parse or train maybe 5% of the data, which is a 95% reduction. However, Moorhead also addressed the U.S. market drop as an “overreaction.” “I think the market overall should be going crazy because [this is the] uplift of what we were looking for [from AI],” said Moorhead. He added that the investors’ focus should be on the progress in inference. It might be a good time to invest in AI stocks, especially cheap AI stocks during the market’s overreaction. To determine the list of cheap AI stocks, we went through various news articles and stock analyses. We shortlisted the AI stocks with the minimum analyst upside of 30%, as of January 27. Cheap, in the context of this article, means stocks that Wall Street analysts believe are undervalued and will surge to higher share prices. We have ranked the cheap AI stocks to buy based on their popularity among hedge funds, as of Q3 2024, in ascending order. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA’s counterpart, specializes in manufacturing semiconductors, providing processors, and graphics solutions for gaming, data centers, and embedded systems, with a core focus on high-performance computing using AI use cases. Where NVDA led the AI boom in 2024, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shares plunged over 35% in the last year. Earlier in December 2024, someone asked Jim Cramer if he was worried about AMD and the stock’s underperformance. Here is what Cramer said: “This is very difficult, and you’re absolutely right to bring it up, and I’m glad you did. Here’s the problem. It is absolutely true—it is absolutely true that they’re not doing as well as Nvidia. It is true that they do not have the big Amazon orders that I’ve been looking at. But can we just remember that Lisa Su has built an amazing company, taking a lot of shares from Intel? She got the number two when it comes to the data center, when it comes to AI, and come on, she just did the great deal where she got all these engineers to come in. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has transformed its business from a struggling company to a semiconductor leader, with its stock jumping from $3 to $115 over a decade, as of January 27. In 2024, AMD introduced the Instinct MI325X AI accelerators and next-generation networking solutions, focusing on strengthening its position in the AI data center market. The company’s majority of revenue comes from data center sales. In 2024, the company acquired ZT Systems for around $5 billion. The ZT Systems purchase will further help Advanced Micro Devices in improving its market share in AI data centers. During the third quarter of 2024, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) posted a revenue of $6.82 billion, up by 18% year-over-year and beating estimates by $104.33 million. The data center revenue accounted for $3.5 billion, up 122% year-over-year, driven by significant growth in EPYC CPU and Instinct GPU sales. On January 21, Citi maintained a Buy rating on AMD shares and lowered the price target from $200 to $175. The firm expects a drop in semiconductor sales due to weaker demand in PC, automotive, and industrial markets. However, analysts project AMD’s data center business to expand, driven by AI sales. Overall, AMD ranks 4th on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Business NEW YORK : A development in the field of artificial intelligence that staggered asset prices could help set the stage for broader stock strength beyond the narrow group of technology shares that has propelled the market higher. Tech stocks, led by megacap companies, have been the driving force of the current bull market. The S&P 500 tech sector has gained some 90 per cent in the past two years, nearly doubling the gain for the overall benchmark index. But the sector stumbled badly on Monday as investors factored in implications from the low-cost Chinese AI model, with shares of high-profile tech names such as Nvidia, Broadcom and Oracle getting pummeled. Even as the group recouped some of those losses on Tuesday, investors were considering the changing character of the market, especially as they anticipate broader earnings improvement this year. "It's a catalyst for more balanced market leadership," said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services. "Ultimately, that's a positive because that means there are other areas for investors to make money." Market leadership has been particularly concentrated in a group of tech and tech-related megacap stocks known as the Magnificent Seven: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Tesla. Those stocks combined accounted for 55 per cent of the S&P 500's total return since the end of 2022 as of Monday, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. This year, however, the Magnificent Seven overall had been a negative influence on S&P 500 performance as of Monday. Signs of a nascent rotation were evident amid the DeepSeek fallout. Even as the S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent on Monday, dragged down by stocks that carry heavy weights in the index, about 70 per cent of S&P 500 constituents rose, according to Barclays strategists. "Sector performance differed from similar risk-off days of the past few years, showing a notable 'broadening' tilt away from tech," the Barclays strategists said in a note. The S&P 500 growth index, which is heavily populated by tech stocks, dropped about 3.6 per cent on Monday, while the counterpart value stock index rose nearly 1 per cent. That was the biggest one-day percentage point advantage for value stocks over growth in the roughly 30 years of data on record, according to LSEG data. While Wall Street may take time to understand the implications from DeepSeek, Monday's "price action was a slap in the face to a lot of people who thought these stocks were invincible and the end result may be to take some of the chips out of that sector and spread it around to other areas of the market," said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel. In the options market, while there was some element of dip buying, traders appeared interested in broadening their horizon beyond the Magnificent Seven stocks. "I think people are using this as an opportunity to start to check out other sectors," said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. Many investors already had been expecting stock strength to spread beyond tech and the Magnificent Seven, stemming from earnings trends. While Magnificent Seven earnings growth far exceeded performance for the rest of the S&P 500 over the past year, that gap is expected to close. In 2025, Magnificent Seven earnings are expected to rise 19 per cent against a 12.3 per cent increase for the rest of the index, said Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG. A flood of quarterly earnings reports is due over the next few weeks, including Microsoft, Meta and Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday. "That's important to watch these earnings come in," said Don Nesbitt, senior portfolio manager at F/m Investments. "You have some signals that, yes, things could be broadening out here." Plenty of investors remain bullish on tech and even some who expect a market broadening say the group can continue to do well. Indeed, the tech sector bounced back on Tuesday, rising over 3 per cent, but was still lower than before the DeepSeek news rippled through markets. Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management, said DeepSeek could lead to a rotation to companies that could gain from access to lower-cost AI, with software stocks among the potential beneficiaries. He manages portfolios that hold software stocks including Microsoft, ServiceNow and Salesforce. Monday's market action gave a "jolt" to a potential market broadening, said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital. But given how long tech has held the market reins, Todd said, "it's going to take some time for that to turn."

EditorCrypto CoinDesk, Helene Braun, Krisztian Sandor The Securities and Exchange Commission had previously only allowed cash redemptions when the spot bitcoin ETFs were approved last January. Nasdaq has filed a proposed rule change to allow in-kind creation and redemption for the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a Friday filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The process allows large institutional investors, called authorized participants (APs), to buy and redeem shares of the fund directly to bitcoin (BTC). It is considered to be more efficient as it allows APs closely monitor the demand for the ETF and to act fast by buying or selling shares of the fund without cash being involved in the process. Retail investors are not eligible to participate. When the SEC first approved spot bitcoin ETFs including IBIT last January, the agency allowed to launch the funds with cash redemption, instead of bitcoin. “It should have been approved in the first place but Gensler/Crenshaw didn’t want to allow it for a whole host of reasons they gave,” Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote on X. “Mainly [they] didn’t want brokers touching actual Bitcoin.” BlackRock’s IBIT is the largest spot BTC ETF on the market, attracting nearly $40 billion of inflows in its first year, making it the most successful ETF debut ever.

Discover actionable insights for crafting authentic impactful campaigns and enhancing your SEO efforts, while elevating your brand. Three events, including a $500k investment, signal that a parallel WordPress community is gaining momentum Three recent events may signal the direction in which the WordPress community is evolving and have the feel of pieces falling into place. What’s happening isn’t a change in the WordPress community itself but the emergence of a parallel one. There is movement to build a parallel community and infrastructure to WordPress. The goal is to bring stability to WordPress and ensure that it continues to be the world’s most popular content management system. Recent events related to the Automattic and Mullenweg dispute with WP Engine have given rise to actions that may in time wrest control of WordPress away from Automattic and Matt Mullenweg. This second approach of creating an alternative WordPress community gained major support from GoDaddy in the form of a half million dollar donation to the non-profit The WP Community Collective, a group whose goal is to support an independent WordPress open source ecosystem. GoDaddy explained: “GoDaddy …just invested a half-million dollars in the WordPress community through a donation to The WP Community Collective, an initiative focused on funding and empowering WordPress contributors. This monetary support will be directed towards providing financial, operational and promotional support within the greater WordPress community. The WP Community Collective contribution by GoDaddy… aims to strengthen open source communities by providing resources for designers, developers and other contributors who make the internet work.” What makes the GoDaddy funding interesting is that one of the investors in GoDaddy, BlackRock, is also an investor in Automattic. BlackRock recently lowered the value of their stake in Automattic, which is said to currently be less than one percent. The second piece of the alternative WordPress community is in the form of an investment made by Joost de Valk in an actual WordPress business community that was founded 15 years ago. Joost is turning it into a non-profit and setting it up with a governance board. According to the announcement: “…we’re excited about this community and the history that has brought Post Status to where it is – a true staple of the WordPress community where thoughts flow freely, business is done, and mutual support is abundant. …Over the past few months, it’s become very clear that Post Status is an enormously important place for the community to come together and discuss all things WordPress. A place with light moderation, but also with true freedom of speech (within the boundaries of treating everyone with respect) and the freedom to have different opinions. We want to enshrine those freedoms even more. That’s why we (Marieke and myself) will be buying Post Status” Joost de Valk, the founder of Yoast SEO plugins, has recently become an outspoken advocate of changing WordPress governance to a more democratic model and of creating a parallel WordPress structure that secures and stabilizes the distribution of WordPress themes and plugins. There have been ongoing discussions across the WordPress community about decentralizing plugin and theme distribution so that WordPress.org, which is controlled by Automattic and Matt Mullenweg, is no longer the sole source. Decentralization would remove that control by distributing software through multiple channels. Karim Marucchi (LinkedIn profile), well known in the WordPress community as a leader in enterprise WordPress development, wrote about securing the supply chain in reference to making the availability of plugin and themes secure and trustworthy. He wrote: “Securing the Supply Chain & Start Modernization The first step is to act on what Joost called Federated And Independent Repositories. It is absolutely imperative that we show the world that we have supply chain security. To create a community Plugin, we should immediately form a collaboration group between independent contributors, multiple hosting companies, agencies, and the broader product community within our ecosystems. Designed from day one to prevent any business or entity from disrupting the supply chain” Joost de Valk recently wrote about the importance of a federated repository: “We need to supplement WordPress.org updates with other sources, so that what happened to Advanced Custom Fields, can’t happen again. Lots of hosts are currently experimenting with or already putting in place mirrors of WordPress.org. This creates issues: download and active install statistics are no longer reliable, for instance. Just having mirrors of WordPress.org also doesn’t really solve the problem of a single party controlling our single update server. For that, we need to make sure that those mirrors federate with each other, and share each others data and, as Karim suggested, allow for independent plugins and themes to be hosted there, outside of the wordpress.org repository. I call this: Federated and Independent Repositories, in short: FAIR. I’m already talking to several hosts about this, and would welcome anyone who wants to join these conversations, so we’re not duplicating work.” There is now a project called AspirePress that aims to decentralize WordPress which has been gathering momentum. AspirePress intends to become a mirror repository and eventually become a decentralized distributed model, which is expressed in their motto at the top of every page: “Decentralize. Distribute. Democratize.” AspirePress is committed to being a truly open source WordPress community project: “AspirePress is a community-driven open-source project aimed at providing resources and tools to improve the lives of WordPress developers everywhere. We are focused on building a package mirror to freely distribute plugins and themes to WordPress users, no matter who or where they are.” AspirePress is an example of people in the WordPress community taking steps to decentralize WordPress so that one entity can’t unilaterally take over someone else’s plugin and replace it with their own as Automattic and Matt Mullenweg did to WP Engine’s highly popular ACF plugin which was completely replaced with a renamed version controlled by Automattic. Google’s founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, were Stanford university students who at a certain point decided that it was in their company’s best interest to bring in a CEO with experience to take over and that’s what happened. Google’s founders still remained involved in the company but CEO seat was filled by someone else who was trustworthy. Google’s one of the largest and most influential companies in the world and is an example of founders who successfully relinquished control to more experienced hands. So it’s not like there is no precedent of a company founder who successfully handed control to someone else in order to grow the company. There are other examples in the open source community as well: These examples of successful transitions in for-profit and open-source organizations demonstrate that change in leadership and control can lead to growth. The three developments discussed in this article reflect the gradual shifts occurring in WordPress, a platform that supports thousands of jobs and generates billions in revenue worldwide. Stakeholders invested in WordPress’s stability may see these developments as steps toward that goal.

Title: CNB considers shifting up to 5% of Czech reserves into Bitcoin

Governor Michl advocates Bitcoin as a diversification tool amid increasing institutional adoption across the world. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Aleš Michl will reportedly propose adding Bitcoin to the country’s reserve assets, Financial Times reported on Jan. 29. If approved, his plan would see the bank eventually allocate as much as 5% of its $146.13 billion reserves to Bitcoin, moving beyond its traditional gold and US dollar holdings. Earlier this month, he hinted at potential adjustments to the bank’s reserve strategy, suggesting a broader approach to asset allocation. Bitwise’s European Head of Research, André Dragosch, said the proposed investment could amount to $7.3 billion in Bitcoin. This would place CNB’s BTC reserves above its $4.3 billion gold holdings and account for roughly 5.3 months of newly mined Bitcoin. Dragosch said: “Czech central bank holds around 146 billion USD in official reserve assets of which 138 billion USD are FX reserves and 4.3 billion USD are gold. They plan to invest up to 5% of these reserves into BTC (approximately 7.3 billion USD / ~71,568 BTC).” CNB’s Michl sees Bitcoin as a diversification tool amid rising institutional adoption. He pointed to growing interest in crypto-related investment products, particularly after asset managers like BlackRock launched BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He also noted shifting US policies, including President Donald Trump‘s deregulation efforts and increased engagement between crypto firms and policymakers. Under the Trump administration, the US has adopted a more friendly disposition to the emerging industry and recently signed an executive order designed to make America a leader in the sector. Michl said: “For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good…Those [Trump] guys can now kind of create some bubble for bitcoin, but I think the trend would be an increase without those guys as well, because it’s an alternative [investment] for more people.” Although Bitcoin remains volatile, Michl believes its rising adoption justifies its inclusion in national reserves. He acknowledged the risks but emphasized the CNB’s experience in managing fluctuating assets. “It’s possible to have a big range of outcomes, that bitcoin will have a value of zero or an absolutely fantastic value . . . but in our history we have also had some stocks like Enron or the payment company Wirecard, so we have some experience with bad investments, so, yes, I’m ready [for a possible Bitcoin collapse],” he said.

Title: Trump Dumps the Paris Agreement: Is it a Big Deal?
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/01/29/trump-dumps-the-paris-agreement-is-it-a-big-deal/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T10:00:00Z

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change by Tilak Doshi From THE DAILY SCEPTIC According to the UK’s Telegraph, just hours after President Trump issued executive orders to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, Ed Miliband, the British Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, “warned” Mr Trump that the rise of Net Zero is “unstoppable”. The tendentiousness of the Telegraph’s headline is remarkable. Just who is this mere Department Secretary to “warn” the Chief Executive of the world’s leading economic and military power of anything? Evidently, the British Secretary is deluded enough to take up the mantle of responsibility to warn President Trump of ignorance in energy affairs. But Mr Miliband has company, ranging from leading academics to senior global leaders conferring at last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos. Rather than simply dismissing his antics as another sign of Mad Ed’s silly climate posturing, it behoves us to take his warning at face value. Is the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement really such a big deal? Appearing before the House of Lords Environment and Climate Change Committee a day after President Trump’s inauguration, Mr Miliband sought to downplay the impact of America’s planned withdrawal from the international climate treaty which Mr. Trump had announced on the same day. He said Other countries believed it was in their national self-interest to remain in the Paris Agreement and to continue working on these (climate) issues, because they saw both the advantages of moving forward on this and the dangers for them of not moving forward. So I think the transition is unstoppable, not fast enough, but unstoppable. Presumably, M. Miliband was referring to Mr Trump’s previous withdrawal from the Paris agreement during his first term in office from January 2017, a move which was promptly reversed by President Joe Biden in January 2021. President Biden’s administration reversed almost every energy initiative of the previous administration. It sought to portray the first exit from the Paris agreement – and Mr Trump’s first-term Presidency – as an aberration from the liberal-progressive ‘arc of history’. After all, as it was widely claimed by the Democrat establishment and its media shills, wasn’t the Trump win in 2016 only made possible by Russian collusion? In 2017, when Mr Trump first gave notice of withdrawal from the Paris agreement, a statutory delay of four years from the date of the agreement coming into force in November 2016 applied. In effect, the US was out of the agreement for only a few months before Trump’s first term Presidency expired. This time around, the statutory delay is one year. Thus from 2026 onwards, at least to the end of Mr Trump’s second term, the US will be not participate in any of the Paris agreement commitments including any financial obligations. The US thus remained a party to the Paris agreement for almost the entirety of President Trump’s first term, during which its administrative staff continued participating in programmes and initiatives that were pursued under the Obama Presidency. The US State Department continued to participate in the ongoing negotiations, including co-chairing with China the Enhanced Transparency Framework. At the COP29 UN annual climate summit held in Baku, Azerbaijan, in the shadow of Trump’s triumphant election win, Mr John Podesta – President Biden’s Climate Envoy – had no hesitation in telling governments around the world to “keep faith” in their efforts to “combat global warming”. He confidently asserted that the Trump Presidency could only slow, not stop, the transition from fossil fuels: For those of us dedicated to climate action, last week’s outcome in the United States is obviously bitterly disappointing. … But what I want to tell you today is that while the United States federal Government, under Donald Trump, may put climate action on the back burner, the work to contain climate change is going to continue in the United States. Gina McCarthy, President Obama’s Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and later the White House Climate Adviser for President Biden, accused the Trump administration of having “abdicated its responsibility to protect the American people and our national security” by leaving the Paris Agreement. Now representing an environmental NGO, Ms McCarthy assured her audience that “our states, cities, businesses and local institutions stand ready to pick up the baton of US climate leadership and do all they can — despite federal complacency — to continue the shift to a clean energy economy”. The belief that the global climate agenda signified by the Paris agreement is undiminished despite the re-election of Donald Trump is not restricted to US Democrat and environmental NGO activists. At last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: The coming years will be vital well beyond Europe. All continents will have to speed up the transition towards Net Zero and deal with the growing burden of climate change. …The Paris Agreement continues to be the best hope for all humanity. So Europe will stay the course and keep working with all nations that want to protect nature and stop global warming. President Trump’s second term is unlikely to repeat the mistakes of his first one. He has taken a sledgehammer approach to replacing Democrat activists in Government with staff more inclined to his ‘MAGA’ vision. President Trump has long said he believes the biggest mistake he made during his first term was hiring people disloyal to his campaign promises. Harvard University’s Robert Stavins – a leading academic who has done decades of research and published extensively on international climate negotiations – seems to find it disappointing that “Trump now seems determined to purge the upper ranks for the executive branch of anyone other than loyalists”. As if an incoming President would seek to hire disloyal staff! Few would disagree with White House spokesman Steven Cheung, who said that: “No one should be surprised that those being hired should align with the mission of the administration. Nobody in private industry would ever hire someone who isn’t mission focused, and the Government should be no different.” Brian McCormack, Chief of Staff to National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, finds President Trump’s hiring decisions similarly unexceptional: “Every President is entitled to have a staff and the advisers that he needs to implement the goals that the American people elected him to pursue.” President Trump’s detractors have suggested that despite his pulling the US out of the Paris agreement, it will matter little to the global climate agenda. The ‘show must go on’ and true believers will step in to the breach. Thus, last week’s Reuters headline about billionaire climate warrior Michael Bloomberg who “steps in to help fund UN climate body after Trump withdrawal”. Climate alarmists Ed Miliband, Ursula von der Leyen, Gina McCarthy and Michael Bloomberg share an underlying presumption that the energy transition away from fossil fuels to the brave new world of renewable energy and ‘clean tech’ is made inevitable because ‘markets demand it’ and technological change has made it possible. In the great moral crusade to ‘save the planet’, they share the fatal conceit that what they want is what the world needs. Yet, Trump’s second term takes place in a vastly changed world from his first. The rise of populist parties in Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Hungary, Poland, France, Germany and the UK – dismissed as the ‘far Right‘ by the mainstream media – in a Europe stricken with deindustrialisation and recession has fundamentally altered the policy presumptions that held sway just a few years ago. Ms Von der Leyen’s own party, a constituent of the European Parliament’s EPP which is the EU’s most influential political group, is now recommending a freeze of the CO2 duty, abolishing renewable energy targets and reverting to pre-2019 ‘green wave’ policies. If Brussels is looking shaky in its anti-Trump predilections, the world of international business seems to have collapsed like a house of cards in its previous trumpeting of the ESG agenda. The ESG movement, a crucial pillar in the business sector’s buy-in of the Paris agreement, has had a series of reversals recently. The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative and Climate Action 100+, which pushed ESG goals and decarbonisation of the American economy, suffered a flurry of high-profile exits by companies such as BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management company. “More than 70 companies have left woke ESG organisations like NZAM and Climate Action 100+ since the Committee’s investigation started,” Republican Jim Jordan told the Daily Wire. The Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) was established in April 2021 under the auspices of the United Nations and its champion Mark Carney, the ‘rock star central banker‘. It was dedicated to helping lenders reduce their carbon footprints. The group has been abandoned in quick succession by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley. The ESG colossus, which seemed to have reigned supreme in business boardrooms the world over in the past decade, has now been irretrievably compromised. The adage ‘go woke, go broke‘ was right on target. No, the markets do not drive the so-called energy transition and technological change obeys the laws of physics and economics. For instance, in the transportation sector, neither markets nor technology has made electric vehicles affordable or popular. Within hours of being sworn into the White House, President Donald Trump signed an executive order meant to end policies supporting EVs. In his inauguration speech, Mr Trump said: “We will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers. … In other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.” President Trump has not only given Americans their freedom to buy cars of their choice, a very big deal in that country. He has also eased bureaucrat-imposed efficiency standards for dishwashers, showerheads, refrigerators, laundry machines, toilets, gas cookers, incandescent lights and the like. Mr Trump, in short, has rescued the American consumer from the dead hand of an impoverishing green ideology that yields ultimate power to an efficiency technocracy. These measures are part of President Trump’s flurry of executive orders which remove regulatory obstacles to the rapid development of fossil fuel resources and all associated infrastructure while seeking to prevent wind farms from being built on federal lands and waters. President Trump’s executive order for the US to exit the Paris agreement is a huge deal, not least in saving the nation hundreds of millions of dollars which would have been spent on climate boondoggles such as President Biden’s euphemistically termed Inflation Reduction Act and vast transfers in climate funds pledged to developing countries. Let not the naysayers say otherwise. Dr Tilak K. Doshi is an economist, a member of the CO2 Coalition and a former contributor to Forbes. Follow him on Substack and X. Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe “…co-chairing with China the Enhanced Transparency Framework.”? China, the world’s largest producer of carbon pollution (and probably the largest producer of actual pollution), all while producing the most equipment for Green Energy, has no interest whatsoever in transparency. This revelation, by Dr. Doshi, is sufficient justification for resigning from the Paris accord. Dr. Doshi is also right on about Trump house-cleaning in his second Administration. And that’s the rub. The people that think they can control the weather by eliminating fossil fuel CO2 emissions cannot even reduce let alone eliminate those emissions. Global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels have continued to rise over the last 30 years and at best, may be looking at those emissions leveling off in the next 5-10 years. It’s a complete farce. Pied piper Xi is happy to lead his useful idiots off the net zero cliff. The US greenies do not know it yet, but they are in free-fall, because Trump will systematically take away their $lollipops, by installing people loyal to MAGA, which means getting out the chainsaw and cut, cut, cut. When the greenies hit bottom, they will splatter into the dust of awful history Not to mention disbanding the Climate Youth Corps or whatever it actually is called. That group reminds me of 1930s Germany. Biden’s henchmen are Nazis. Yes, he is! Xi must be shocked at how easy it is to manipulate Western politicians. And no doubt, is very happy about it as it makes his job easier. But,now he is going to have to deal with Trump. Which might end up working out for all concerned. Trump is a Game Changer. Game Changer, yes, but first he has to disrupt the status quo, which he is doing vigorously. Xi will not lead his useful idiots off the cliff. He’s smarter than that. What he will do is to lead his useful idiots up to edge of the cliff and then give them a shove. After his useful idiots are gone, he will be the only man standing and he can do whatever he wants to do. With India increasing like China had and the rest of the underdeveloped world playing catch up, 5-10 years is unrealistic. Emissions will continue from China at 35–40% of global emissions until India surpasses them around 2060. Emissions will likely increase unabated until well past 2100. All the better for the Biome! “It’s a complete farce.” Yes, it is. There is no “carbon pollution.” Please stop spreading propaganda by adopting their falsehoods as part of your language. Word play is what the ****s are good at. There is Carbon Pollution though in the form of Soot. Black Soot that can cover part of the surface of Greenland yearly and is responsible for some ice melt. But CO2 is not Carbon anymore than H2O is Hydrogen Please notice that I qualified the “carbon pollution” meme by using the term “real pollution”, as a reference to smog, smoke, industrial acids, covid, etc. Lot’s of vocabulary used by the Climate Syndicate is bogus and we all need to stop giving them credibility by using their words. Control the words, control the ideas. — K. Marx Industrial wind facility does not equal a “farm” Same with using “gender” when the meaning is “sex”. A favourite quote of mine from Alice in Wonderland — which is where a lot of climate maniacs seem to live: When I use a word,” Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, “it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.””The question is,” said Alice, “whether you can make words mean so many different things.””The question is,” said Humpty Dumpty, “Which is to be master—that’s all.” As Uncle Karl said, “control the words, control the ideas”! Orwell warned us as well. I agree and we can help stop this but dumping the “Green House Gas effect” meme in favor of “Infrared Absorption effect” or “IA effect” for short. We can go with “Infrared Absorption and Emission effect” (or IAE effect for short). I’d stay away from “IRA effect” for obvious reasons. :-)…. Personally I’m using “IA effect” because its the absorption that matters as its about ‘storing the incoming energy in the earth system’. Once you get there than its one step more to identify that the earth system stores the energy in multiple ways not just via IA. And of course its one more step to demonstrate a minor change in the system that allows for more of the Sun’s energy to be available to store (the Albedo changing) can explain all the supposed increase in the stored energy. Long story short we need to use the proper language to properly educate not confuse and obfuscate. The climate doomers rely on an ‘uneducated populace’ to push their hoax. Proper language and concepts educate people, and an educated population is serious trouble to socialists/doomers. Control the words, control the ideas I can’t find any reference to that being an actual quote from Karl Marx. Can you point it out for us? Marx did claim that the “ruling class” maintains their power by shaping social consciousness through the way they use language. So I think it’s true that Marxists applied the theory of manipulating language that Marx originally claimed was a tactic of the capitalists oppressing the workers. For example, Saul Alinsky observed in Rules for Radicals (1971): He who controls the language controls the masses It’s also a theme of George Orwell’s novel 1984 (1948) although from an anti-Marxist point of view: Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? It’s similar to how today’s Green activists seem to cultivate perverted aspects of religion to manipulate people into accepting sacrifices for Net Zero, in line with Marx’s view that religion is the opiate of the masses. I’m not trying to be difficult. I agree that Marxism is a disastrous evil. It’s double-plus-ungood to use the Newspeak. But it’s not a good way to influence people to misrepresent the ideas of those whom we oppose. Marx was commenting on what he thought to be the unjust actions of the ruling class, not recommending a new approach for communists to control the masses. Socialist followers of Marx such as Stalin and Hitler applied the theory to their goal of becoming and remaining the ruling class. In a similar vein, we often see quotations from Hitler (actually Goebbels) about repeating a big lie often enough that it will be believed. But the original quote is taken out of context to make it seem that the Germans were so depraved as to be receptive to Nazis openly proposing telling lies to manipulate the public. In this case it was supposedly the Jews who were employing that tactic. And also quite similarly, Nazis actually ended up doing what they claimed that their enemies were doing. If you’re not seeing where I’m going with this, it is that “the truth will set you free”. We should never use any form of deception to influence others, If we misrepresent the thoughts and words of our enemies, those whom we hope to influence may discover our deception (which I will charitably assume is usually just an innocent error), and may conclude that nothing we say is true. Fair enough. Although that quote is often (in error) attributed to Marx. I did not do my homework. It is Carbon Dioxide Enhancement. MAGA will lead to CO2 enhancement to promote growth of flora and fauna, which increases greenery all over the world and increases crop yields to feed hungry people. What is not to like?. Net-Zero by 2050 is a Suicide Pact “Dr. Doshi is also right on about Trump house-cleaning in his second Administration.” Yes, he is. Most of the people Trump is firing are Democrats. They are the “Swamp”. Trump is draining the Swamp. In this last presidential election, in Washington DC, Harris and the Democrats got 93 percent of the vote, and Trump got seven percent of the vote. That ought to tell you just how big the Swamp is in Washington DC. It needs a lot of draining. Yes, excellent article, Dr. Doshi. And never, never agree to making D.C. at State [with 2 Senators & 1 Rep.]. If they need representation in Congress, we should cede all the non-government used land [ie the residential areas] back to Virginia &/or Maryland where it came from. Today it is just Maryland. Virginia pulled out during the great war of Secession. One thing that is quite clear is the fact that Flywheel Miliband and his ilk do not live in the world as we know it. In the UK we are going in the opposite direction to Trump, most notably on freedom of speech [and thought]. The big thing – thus far – is to label opponents… All part of controlling people. “Apparently, complaints of ‘two-tier policing’ are one example of a ‘right-wing extremist narrative’.” https://www.spiked-online.com/2025/01/28/outraged-by-grooming-gangs-youre-an-extremist/ By that token opposing net zero makes one instantly right wing, a fascist etc. “In a recent study, CSSN Scholar Matthew Paterson delves into the emergence of “anti-net zero populism” in the UK, analyzing how right-wing populists use discourse to undermine climate policies and the net-zero emissions target across various policy areas.” https://cssn.org/the-rise-of-anti-net-zero-populism-in-the-uk-comparing-rhetorical-strategies-for-climate-policy-dismantling/ You can’t have a serious discussion with the 6th form student protest brigades, in or out of office. Thinking for yourself? That’s a far-right idea for a start. And the science is settled. News that amuses Rachel Reeves is set to deliver her much-touted ‘growth’ speech in Oxfordshire this morning after months of economic woes— […] Reeves will warn that “growth will not come without a fight”—a fight that’s looking to be against her own Cabinet. She’s expected to back airport expansion, including at Gatwick, Luton, and Heathrow. Tractors and protesting farmers have turned up outside Reeves’ event in Oxford. Starmer is in the Times likening himself to Thatcher again. Another reset… By reaching a negative rating of -41 Starmer has beat Rishi’s lowest ever point of -41 at the time of the election. When asked to describe Starmer in one word, respondents where most likely to choose: “Useless,” “Liar,” and “Bad.” https://order-order.com/#_@/wJLubnJnb8s3yA Of course, they will continue to delude themselves Emma Barnett (BBC) cut in: “And contribute to climate change with an extra runway?” She pointed to eco-entrepreneur and Labour donor Dale Vince’s attacks on the plan, after he called it “an illusion of growth”. But Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said he still believes there is “no tension” between the UK’s climate goals and the possibility of Heathrow expansion. “No tension? How is an extra runway no tension?” Barnett replied. He said there would be the same emissions, and “people are still going to fly”. The presenter hit back: “You don’t expect emissions to go up if there’s an extra runway?” Reynolds said Labour is committed to decarbonising aviation. https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/minister-no-tension-between-airport-expansion-and-climate-goals_uk_6799d83ce4b01949837eefe9 Here endeth the lesson. This reminded me of the alternative fab four – The Rutles. Did you ever get the feeling That the truth is less revealing Than a downright lie? The Starmer government should be declared persona non grata in the US for the next 4 years and 8 more years under Vance, for actively trying to make America worse again, MAWA “analyzing how right-wing populists use discourse to undermine climate policies” The only reason “discourse” is effective is because the discourse amounts to skeptics saying climate alarmists don’t have evidence that CO2 does what they claim it does, and since the climate alarmists *don’t* have any evidence, the discourse is effective. When you say show us the evidence, and the other side can’t come up with any evidence, then the impartial observer has to think there must not be any evidence to substantiated the climate crisis claims. Climate Alarmists have no evidence to back up their claims of climate change doom. THAT is their problem, not skeptic discourse about it. The problem surrounding discourse is that in the realm of activism subjectivity rules. Mere consensus, even the illusion of it, is treated as evidence. Speculation is accorded the status of solidity, and the act of questioning is perceived as violence. When you present data refuting a claim, “Yes it is!” is considered a sufficient response. Reason and logic have no hold on such a paradigm. Good comment. It’s not so much what the USA does which undermines Net Zero; it’s China. While emissions have been falling in the USA, they have been rising in China. And that rise sems likely to continue. So the UK can continue to reduce its measly one percent contribution to global emissons. The EU can continue doing the same. But at the end of the day global emissions will continue to rise. And Ed Milliband can jump up and down and wave his arms up and down and it will make absolutely no difference. Not forgetting India. As goes China So goes India And the rest of the developing world to follow Nobody ever mentions Africa. Africa has scarcely begun emitting CO₂ Funny that China, the second largest economy and second largest population in the world is classified as “developing” and therefore exempt. It’s not funny at all. It was planned that way by western politicians. Think about it. China is a 6000 year old culture with nuclear weapons and a space program and is only called “developing” by western nations who think they own the world. Not exactly, unless you view the UN as western only. If Ed jumps up and down and waves his arms fast enough he can become his own personal wind turbine and that will show them! But the sub-text in so many comments (right across the board, not solely on WUWT) is the implication that China and India should not be allowed to pollute when the rest of us are doing our best to “save the planet”. “The planet” has been around a lot longer than we have and the idea that the planet needs ‘saving’ or that humanity can do anything effective towards that end is hubris of the first order. And things aren’t improved when we don’t (most of us) properly understand what we are supposed to be doing. You refer twice to ‘global emissions’. Your one percent is 1% of 3% of 0.042% which is the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. We could treble our emissions and the planet would not notice the difference except that it would be greener and crop yields would be better. The ’emissions’ associated with mining and processing rare earth minerals for wind turbines, not to mention the construction, shipping, installation of those things and the environmental damage they cause are a different matter and that is what should be concerning us. CO2 is an irrelevance as far as climate is concerned. And to be honest, so are we! story tip In First White House Briefing, Youngest Press Secretary Ever Eschews TraditionPress secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president would open the briefing room to bloggers, podcasters and social-media influencers https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/drones-influencers-and-medicaid-what-to-know-about-the-first-white-house-briefing-of-trumps-second-term-4446b719?mod=hp_lista_pos2 To eliminate the monopoly of the leftist-biased Corporate Media, which is decades overdue Karoline Leavitt went into the news conference without a briefing book. She had all the answers in her head. She also knew the names of all the reporters in the room. I thought she did a good job. She needs to relax a little. I’m sure she will as she gets used to the job. Not too many “gotcha! questions” from the reporters. They seem to be handling the situation the way a legitimate reporter should be handling it. So far. The Trump Juggernaut has them a little intimidated. Heritage Foundation? From the article: “According to the UK’s Telegraph, just hours after President Trump issued executive orders to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, Ed Miliband, the British Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, “warned” Mr Trump that the rise of Net Zero is “unstoppable”.” I bet Trump got a good laugh out of that. Trump will be visiting the UK shortly, and he and Miliband can discuss it. Miliband will end up looking like the Mayor of Los Angeles after her conversation with Trump last week. She couldn’t agree with Trump fast enough, she was so intimidated by Trump, and the truth he was speaking. Trump will lay a little truth on Miliband, too. The Paris accord won’t be able to do much without US cash. From the article: “Other countries believed it was in their national self-interest to remain in the Paris Agreement and to continue working on these (climate) issues, because they saw both the advantages of moving forward on this and the dangers for them of not moving forward. So I think the transition is unstoppable, not fast enough, but unstoppable.” This is why the UK is going down the Net Zero Road to Ruin. Their politicians look at the world this way, and see no option but to install windmills and solar and battery backup even though it should be obvious by this time to a rational person that windmills, solar, and battery storage are not fit for the purpose of powering human society. They are, in fact, detrimental to human society. From the Telegraph; too little, too late? Lord Mandelson: I was wrong to call Trump a danger to the world ﻿ Lol Wonderful to see Mandelson grovelling…. Ed Miliband, the British Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, “warned” Mr Trump that the rise of Net Zero is “unstoppable”. Nothing to worry about. ﻿Ed’s referring to the number of brain cells he (Ed) possesses Other Countries Believed… Most of those “Other Countries” are receiver nations from the climate graft fund that the US was required to be one of the few “Funding Countries” From the article: “The belief that the global climate agenda signified by the Paris agreement is undiminished despite the re-election of Donald Trump is not restricted to US Democrat and environmental NGO activists.” This is called “Whistling past the graveyard”. Three cheers for Trump. Three boos for Minibrain whose Net Zero plans spell poverty for nil return. My understanding is the Paris Accord is an international treaty that was never ratified by the US Senate and is, therefore, non-binding. The delay for exit is contrary to US Treaties per the Constitution. If it was never ratified, it was never binding from the beginning. This is another case where Presidents have overreached and ignored the Constitution and the US Senate failed in their responsibility of checks and balances. I still believe that this Paris agreement should be submitted to the Senate and voted down for a lack of 2/3 majority. After that happens, throw it into the burn bin that provides heat for the Capitol. I concur. Presidents Executive powers . You may have heard of that in last few days The Paris Accord is wrong in its reasoning but the President can and does sign treatys that are binding. Thats why Trump had to ‘legally undo’ the original binding agreement by Obama The President can enter into an executive agreement (which can include a treaty as that term is used in international law). This can be: a. A “Congressional-Executive” or “legislative-executive” agreement, made by the President under authority granted by Congress under an existing statute; or b. A “sole executive agreement,” created under the President’s own constitutional authority to “take care” that the United States’ laws be faithfully enforced (U.S. Constitution, Art II, § 3) and under the bundle of Constitutional responsibilities collectively referred to as the President’s foreign affairs power (See U.S. Constitution, Art. II, §§ 1, 2, 3; United States 11 Foreign Affairs Manual § 723.2- 2(C)). That took a deep dive. Well done. Note that it is in the context that the US laws can be faithfully enforced. The Paris accord, standing on its own, is not a US law unless/until Congress passes the applicable legislation. As the term is used in international law. That is not the same as in the US Constitution. The Paris Accord is defined as an international treaty. Biden signed an executive order effecting agreement, but that is not the same as ratification, which requires Advice and Consent of the US Senate. As such, it is not Constitutionally binding, nor does it automatically become US Law, which ratified treaties do. As such, all Trump needed to do is exactly what he did. Issue an executive order ending Biden’s agreement. Since it was not a treaty ratified by the US, the US can just walk away. If the UN or other organization wants to sue, let them try. The US is not bound to the ICC, so it will be an interesting read as the drama unfolds. The UN and all of its minions will be wise not to push too hard. After all, the lion’s share of funding comes from US tax dollars and should they push too hard, they might find themselves on a street corner selling pencils. “Mr Trump, in short, has rescued the American consumer from the dead hand of an impoverishing green ideology” Actually Trump has rescued all Americans from the socialist liberal tyranny of the Democrat Party and its prior dictators. If we succeed in Making America Great Again, does it not follow that this success creates opportunities to Make the World Great Again? Curious minds are asking…. I think so. Success is infectious. A successful leader shows the way, and then others take up the quest, after the leader has shown them what can be done, and how it can be done. The freeze on Federal grants has been reversed. Yes another memo went rescinding the earlier one Trumpanzees dont keep up, thats not ‘sucess’ ‘In the memo distributed to federal agencies, Matthew J. Vaeth, acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, states that OMB memorandum M-25-13 “is rescinded.” That order, issued Monday, instructed federal agencies to “temporarily pause all activities related to obligations or disbursement of all federal financial assistance.” Why the need for insults? Only the few wealthy countries of Germany, Australia, Great Britain, New Zealand, other EU countries, and the USA, representing less than one of the eight billion on Planet Earth, that have “green” agendas, are mandating social changes to achieve net zero emissions in their “small worlds within this planet“. And not one of them has called for the elimination of concrete and termites, two of the biggest sources of global atmospheric CO2. Termites also emit lots of methane. Humans emit about 8 billions pounds of CO2 everyday. To this add the amount of CO from domestic animals. We can not get complacent. Trump’s efforts will likely be important for the next 4 years but these crazies pushing the climate hoax are well funded, well organized and very deep in to the political spectrum. Consider just how crazy and devoted you have to be to promulgate the biggest hoax ever on the human population. Barnham of “Barnham & Bailey” fame must be laughing in his grave. The ability of these crazies to be able to convince a significant portion of the population that a trace gas, absolutely necessary for all life on the planet is a ‘pollutant’ that will end all life instead of growing it is amazing. The power of telling a lie over & over again is demonstrated by this hoax. Of course the goal isn’t to ‘save the planet’, its to ‘control the masses’ and socialists will use anything at their disposal to do that. I’ve never much expected politicians to ‘do the right thing’, but they need to step up and not just role back regulations but step-by-step put a dagger in to this hoax. Demonstrating through the climate crazies own words that Net Zero has NOTHING to do with ‘saving the planet’ but about ‘controlling the masses’ (they’ve said it time and again, USE those words!). With the US withdrawing from the Paris Accords, this means that the top 3 countries in terms of CO2 emissions, are all ignoring them. Burying the Paris Accords in a crossroads with a stake in its heart is apparently needed. Submitting the Accords as a formal treaty to the Senate would lead to its formal rejection. Not required . Presidents executive powers suffice especially the foreign affairs powers. The senate only gets the minor treaties these days such as this during Trumps time The reason Paris was not submitted as a treaty is that Obama knew quite well there was no way he could have gotten two thirds in the Senate. The Democrats sit still for that dimunition of the power of the Senate, as they approved of the content, and the Republicans tend to be wussies. John Roberts is very cautious, and “conservative” in the worst sense. Cartoons of DT always seem to add 20 lbs. Must be “fatism”. he is obese. Just the image people told him years ago to wear dark loose suits Except on golf course Ideology whiplash. Had there been a legal vote in America in 2020 we wouldn’t be going through this. I get the feeling that Trump is going to fully investigate the 2020 vote to calm his ego and get the truth out. The 50-60 Trump legal challenges all failed. The recounts all confirmed the original result. The Arizona senate Audit came to the same result. For the 2016 election Trump had his own blue ribbon commission to prove that he won the popular vote . He didnt. Same voting machines or mail ballots and process this time gave the clear winner , just as in 2020, just it wasnt Harris As for mail ballot fraud One such instance took place in North Carolina in the 2018 midterms when Leslie McCrae Dowless, a political operative working for Republican House candidate Mark Harris “defrauded voters by collecting unfilled ballots and then filling in the rest of it to favor the campaign’s candidate,” according to a report from MIT’s Election Lab. As a result of the incident, a new election was held, and Dowless was convicted of fraud in 2020 99.22 Million Ballots Processed in the 2024 General Election https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2024/1202-usps-releases-2024-post-election-analysis-report.htm Duker, the court cases on the 2020 election were all decided on the basis of either laches, the case should have been brought earlier in the process, i.e. before the election, or on standing. No cases were decided on the merits. Extensive use of unvetted mail-in ballots and same day registration led to a lack of any chain of custody. Wisconsin had a literally unbelievable growth in turnout, for example. But you know that, and are gaslighting. “No cases were decided on the merits.” That’s right. I bet duker knows that. So he is spreading disinformation. Add to it that only something like 17 of the something like 67 claims ever made it before a judge, none of which were decided on merit. Very nice. I will say it again no committee, council, bureaucracy, agency or any other gaggle of humans can come close to a lightly regulated free market. It couldn’t be more clear. Let us buy and use the things we want produced in a safe and clean manner and life will be grand. To hell with all those worthless government entities. It’s about time that the US made such action official, anyway. These climate agreements and COP conferences have been accomplishing next to nothing anyway since, among other things, the planet still depends on 82% of its primary energy generation on fossil fuels, while China , India and much of the developing world are still constructing coal plants. At the same time, even though Canada and the US liked to talk about their progress in introducing renewables, last year both set new highs in oil extraction and production. Canada is a classic example of a country that talks a good game about some sort of green transition. Yet during the last two decades it has achieved only 20% of its 2030 emissions-reduction target and might need as much as another 75 years to do so, which won’t bother most citizens in the least. So with such overall global lack of commitments, the Paris deal’s chances of success, like its predecessors’, was a long shot from the outset. Two points for Mr Miliband: 1 The US has done more to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions than almost any other country. https://www.epa.gov/system/files/images/2024-04/total-ghg-over-time-2024.p2g ht2., 2. Forcing development is often dangerous and is always very expensive. Its wasnt a 4 year statuary delay but 3 years It was Trump that added the extra time by not starting the clock till Jun 2017 Even though the agreement was signed in December 2015, the treaty only came into force on 4 November 2016, 30 days after at least 55 countries representing 55% of global emissions had ratified it. No country could give notice to leave the agreement until three years had passed from the date of ratification. No country could give notice to leave the agreement until three years had passed from the date of ratification. True, but the US did not formally ratify it as a treaty. Maybe it’s all for the best, and the crash will propel the eevil populist nationalists into power in Europe. And Ed Miliband will go down as the prototype of the politician that literally understands nothing. Login Sign up to comment or become a paid supporter: Click Here “Walk toward the fire.

Title: DeepSeek's AI breakthrough is calling Big Tech's big spending into question
URL: https://qz.com/tech-earnings-meta-microsoft-apple-deepseek-ai-nvidia-1851749011
Time Published: 2025-01-29T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Big Tech’s multi-billion dollar spending on artificial intelligence will be under investor scrutiny this week — even more so after China’s DeepSeek sent shockwaves through Wall Street and Silicon Valley with a cheap yet competitive AI model. Ahead of earnings results from Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, the AI-driven stock rally lost $1 trillion in value after the Hangzhou-based AI startup demonstrated AI reasoning models on par with OpenAI and Anthropic. Last week’s release of DeepSeek-R1 sparked a global sell-off of tech stocks, with Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P500 futures all falling Monday morning. Nvidia (NVDA) stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. Investors were spooked by DeepSeek, which in December released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. According to the technical paper, DeepSeek said it used a cluster of just under 2,050 graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia for training — much less than the tens of thousands of chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. Meta (META), for example, used 16,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H100s to train its Llama 3 405B model. The tech giant and other U.S. rivals such as OpenAI have touted spending tens of billions on cutting-edge chips and AI infrastructure. Earlier this month, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company is planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure this year, and end up with more than 1.3 million GPUs. Meanwhile, OpenAI announced a new joint venture with tech heavyweights SoftBank (SFTBY) and Oracle (ORCL) to invest $500 billion in building new AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years. DeepSeek’s seemingly efficient and competitive models could challenge Big Tech’s billions in spending on AI infrastructure — but it could also expand the market for AI. Despite questions over DeepSeek’s spending and distilled models, “there are a few clear breakthroughs which show the industry a path to cheaper means of both training and inference,” John Belton, a portfolio manager and analyst at Gabelli Funds, said in a statement shared with Quartz. Belton said DeepSeek’s methods raise questions of “great[er] innovation and therefore compute demand from Western customers,” who have more powerful chips than DeepSeek. Cheaper inferencing could expand the total-addressable-market, Belton said, as well as fulfill Jevon’s Paradox — the idea in economics that the more efficient it is to use a resource, the more likely consumption will increase. Meanwhile, cloud providers could see more demand as the cost of inferencing, or the process of a trained AI model making predictions from new data, declines — also a “definite positive” for AI developers such as Meta, Google (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), Belton said. While Jefferies (JEF)’ analyst said in a note that they “still think there will be a significant capex ramp for AI,” the cost of inferencing needs to scale down to reach mass AI adoption. It’s plausible the efficiency will lead to more demand for hardware to train proprietary models, Mark Klein, chief executive of SuRo Capital (SSSS), said in a statement shared with Quartz, but developers are still unsure how DeepSeek’s approach can scale with larger chip clusters. In the near term, AI-focused chip companies will be “unlikely to see meaningful change” in demand due to DeepSeek, considering supply constraints with chips, data center capacity, and power, analysts at William Blair said in a note. “Longer term, however, the continued pressure to lower the cost of compute—and the ability to reduce the cost of training and inference using new, more efficient algorithmic techniques—could result in lower capex than previously envisioned,” the analysts said. This could lessen Nvidia’s dominance, William Blair analysts said, especially if companies realize they don’t need large-scale chip clusters for frontier models. However, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said the world’s largest companies are not “going to use a Chinese start-up DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases.” “At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia,” Ives said in a statement shared with Quartz. “Launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing.....launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.” Jefferies analysts agreed that Nvidia will be OK. “They were overvalued anyway considering that we are only in first generation of this technology,” a Jefferies analyst said in a note. “Even with less demand for giant GPU data centers, the demand for inference machines will be off the charts.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Screens display a news conference by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2025. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) HONG KONG – U.S. stock indexes slipped Wednesday after the Federal Reserve opted not to cut interest rates for the first time since it began trying to help the economy through easier rates in September. The S&P 500 fell 0.5% following the Fed’s widely expected decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 137 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%. Recommended Videos The reaction was also relatively muted in the bond market following the Fed’s decision, which could hint at rates staying on hold for a while following their swift drop at the end of 2024. Lower rates would help the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and companies to borrow, but the downside is they could also give inflation more fuel. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said after the decision that the central bank could cut rates if inflation were to slow further or if the job market suddenly weakened. But “right now, we don’t see that, and we see things as in a really good place for policy and for the economy, and so we feel like we don’t need to be in a hurry to make any adjustments.” While Wall Street would almost always prefer lower interest rates, “we would continue to focus on why the Fed won’t cut anytime soon, specifically a strong economy and labor, which bodes well for solid corporate earnings growth,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Wednesday's relatively calm movements for financial markets offered some respite following two days of disruption driven by doubts about the artificial-intelligence boom. A Chinese upstart, DeepSeek, has raised nearly existential questions for some of the AI industry after saying it developed a large-language model that can compete with the world’s best without having to use top-flight chips. That casts doubt about whether AI development broadly will require as much spending on chips, vast data centers and electricity as Wall Street and Big Tech had been assuming. That in turn has caused huge swings for stocks across the industry, particularly for Nvidia. The company, whose stock has almost become a symbol of the AI bonanza, fell 4% Wednesday after plunging nearly 17% Monday and then jumping nearly 9% Tuesday. It was the single heaviest weight dragging the S&P 500 lower, by far. Big gains for Nvidia and other Big Tech companies had been instrumental in the S&P 500’s rallying to back-to-back yearly gains of more than 20% for the first time since before the millennium. Nvidia alone accounted for more than a fifth of all of the S&P 500's total return last year. Elsewhere on Wall Street, Starbucks rose 8.1% after delivering a better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Brian Niccol said the chain is planning to cut its food and beverage offerings by 30% over the course of this year to simplify operations and speed service, part of its efforts to turn the company around. T-Mobile US rallied 6.3% after topping Wall Street’s expectations for both profit and revenue in the last three months of 2024. It also said it expects to add between a net 5.5 million and 6 million in postpaid customers this year. Brinker International jumped 16.3% after the company behind Chili’s restaurants delivered better results than expected. CEO Kevin Hochman said Chili’s attracted new customers and that its return customers were coming more frequently. Railroad operator Norfolk Southern rose 1.8% after beating Wall Street’s profit forecasts. There is also growing optimism that a Republican-controlled Congress could ease restrictions on the industry. Frontier Group Holdings climbed 5.3% after announcing it would try for a second time to merge with Spirit Airlines, which sought bankruptcy protection late last year. Frontier said the proposed deal would include newly issued Frontier debt and common stock. Trump Media & Technology Group rose after announcing it would be getting into the financial services business via a partnership with Charles Schwab. TMTG said more details would be released later this year, and what had been a double-digit gain for the notoriously volatile stock shrank to an increase of 6.8%. On the losing end of Wall Street was Danaher, which fell 9.7% after the life sciences, biotechnology and diagnostics company reported results for the latest quarter that just missed analysts’ expectations. All told, the S&P 500 fell 28.39 points to 6,039.31. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 136.83 to 44,713.52, and the Nasdaq composite sank 101.26 to 19,632.32. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 4.53%, where it was late Tuesday. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe. ASML’s stock jumped 5.6% in Amsterdam after announcing strong revenue on demand for its advanced chipmaking tools. In Asia, where many markets were closed for holidays, Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1%. ___ AP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Will DeepSeek forever change the AI industry? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. New AI chatbot DeepSeek is taking the technology world by storm, and has even dethroned ChatGPT from top spot on the iOS App store. There's certainly a lot of speculation about the potential DeepSeek holds, as well as what this could mean for some of the biggest players in tech right now. Plenty of both new and existing firms have invested billions of dollars into Large Language Models in the last few months alone - but DeepSeek has the opportunity to cause chaos in the venture capital world. Having caused the biggest drop in the US stock market in history, the chatbot is understandably a huge talking point - but what are the experts’ predictions? There’s no denying that DeepSeek arriving on the scene has been disruptive, and although the expert opinion isn’t unanimous, the significantly lower development cost is definitely turning heads. If you're confused about what DeepSeek is, or why its causing so much of a stir, check out our article here explaining all you need to know, The pressure is certainly on for US tech firms to respond, but it may not be as destructive as it seems. We heard from 10 experts in the technology industry; Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Steve Povonly, Senior Director of Security Research & Competitive Intelligence at Exabeam: "The release of Chinese-developed DeepSeek has thrown US tech markets into turmoil; this is both justifiable and also perhaps, a bit overblown. The emergence of a technology that ultimately optimizes chip usage and efficiency is likely to apply pressure on existing large chip vendors, which is a very good thing. As the adage goes: "Pressure yields diamonds" and in this case, I believe competition in this market will drive global optimization, lower costs, and sustain the tailwinds AI needs to drive profitable solutions in the short and longer term." Mike Follett, CEO and Founder of Lumen Research: “Last week, Sam Altman and Elon Musk were AI monopolists. Now, it is clear that competition will reduce costs and loosen the grip hold of the biggest players. This represents an opportunity for marketers enabling them to build agents designed for specific problems, at a speed, scale and at a price that drives ROI.” Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group: “This is a wake-up call for markets. The assumption that tariffs could contain China’s technological ambitions is being dismantled in real time. DeepSeek’s breakthrough is proof that innovation will always find a way forward, regardless of economic barriers.” “By restricting China’s access to high-end semiconductors, Washington sought to slow its progress in AI. Instead, it has fueled an acceleration in domestic innovation, forcing Chinese firms to find alternatives. DeepSeek’s achievement is a direct result of this shift. “Rather than being crippled by US sanctions, Beijing has cultivated AI models that require significantly less computing power, diminishing its reliance on American technology and eroding US leverage over global supply chains.” Aleksandr Yampolskiy, CEO of SecurityScorecard: “DeepSeek is trained on 14.8 trillion diverse tokens whereas OpenAI is trained only on 13 trillion. It also costs radically less to train DeepSeek at $6M while OpenAI costs allegedly $100M, making DeepSeek 16.6X more efficient.” “We are living in fascinating times. While "constraints in capital" may seem like a challenge, history has shown us (and DeepSeek has demonstrated) that these constraints often spark innovation and creativity. Security for AI will only become more critical. In a world where the lines between deepfake and human-generated content blur, and where biased information can shape our opinions, the need for robust security and ethical practices will grow exponentially.” Dr. Kjell Carlsson, Head of AI strategy at Domino Data Lab: “Deepseek’s success serves as a powerful reminder that the value of AI lies not in the size of your infrastructure or the exclusivity of your models, but in how effectively they are leveraged to deliver impact. By developing cutting-edge generative AI models without relying on the latest, most expensive hardware, Deepseek has demonstrated that agility and strategy can outpace raw computational power. Their achievements also highlight the vulnerability of incumbents in the generative AI space—proving that open-source innovation continues to be a powerful equalizer, enabling challengers to match and even surpass established players years into the revolution.” “For companies seeking to maximise value from AI, the lesson is clear: success hinges on flexibility and capability, not exclusive partnerships or infrastructure scale. Rather than locking into specific LLM providers or focusing solely on hardware access, organisations should prioritise building the end-to-end capabilities to source AI innovations, design solutions tailored to their unique needs, and operationalise them effectively. This approach ensures that businesses remain agile, competitive, and prepared to harness the next wave of AI advancements, wherever they emerge.” Bradford Levy, Assistant Professor of Accounting, University of Chicago Booth School of Business: “DeepSeek has sent shock waves through the tech industry – directly challenging tech giants like Meta, Microsoft and Open AI." “Until now, it’s been assumed their expertise in designing and operating large-scale distributed systems are essential for training state of the art models. But the development of R1 suggests otherwise – if these models can be trained using 90% fewer chips, the implications for valuation models are massive." “This opens the door for smaller, more agile players to compete, potentially driving more innovation. With limited resources, they proved that scrappy, innovative teams can shake up the industry, even on a shoestring budget." “While impressive, we should remain skeptical of any claims made by those with a vested interest in their own success. Before jumping to conclusions about the broader AI landscape, we need more time to test these models and understand how they achieved these numbers.” Professor Geoff Webb, Department of Data Science & AI, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University: “The emergence of DeepSeek is a significant moment in the AI revolution. Until now it has seemed that billion dollar investments and access to the latest generation of specialised NVIDIA processors were prerequisites for developing state-of-the-art systems.” “This effectively limited control to a small number of leading US-based tech corporations. Due to US embargoes on exporting the latest generation of NVIDIA processors, it also locked out China.” “DeepSeek claims to have developed a new Large Language Model, similar to Chat GPT or Llama, that rivals the state-of-the-art for a fraction of the cost using the less advanced NVIDIA processors that are currently available to China. If this is true, it means that the US tech sector no longer has exclusive control of the AI technologies, opening them to wider competition and reducing the prices they can charge for access to and use of their systems.” “Looking beyond the implications for the stock market, current AI technologies are US-centric and embody US values and culture. This new development has the potential to create more diversity through the development of new AI systems.” “It also has the potential to make AI more accessible for researchers around the world both for developing new technologies and for applying them in diverse areas including healthcare.” Aditya Sood, VP of Security Engineering and AI Strategy at Aryaka: "Open-source AI models like DeepSeek, while offering accessibility and innovation, are increasingly vulnerable to supply chain attacks triggered during large-scale cyberattacks. These attacks, where adversaries exploit the reliance on third-party dependencies, pre-trained models, or public repositories, can have severe consequences. Adversaries may tamper with pre-trained models by embedding malicious code, backdoors, or poisoned data, which can compromise downstream applications. Additionally, attackers may target the software supply chain by manipulating dependencies, libraries, or scripts used during model training or deployment. This can lead to systemic AI functionality corruption." Renuka Nadkarni CPO at Aryaka: "The sudden popularity of DeepSeek comes at a price. There are two dimensions of this. First, threat actors are likely to adopt this new tool now that it's widely available. Second, DeepSeek was a victim of a large-scale malicious attack. This means that their system could be compromised and subject to several of the known AI model attacks. Known AI model vulnerabilities, data risks, and infrastructure threats come into play here." “While the unavailability of the service is an easy and visible attack on its infrastructure, the bigger concern lies in the undetected attacks on its model and data. These hidden threats could compromise benign users and enable other malicious activities." Dan Goman, CEO, Ateliere Creative Technologies: "The market’s reaction to the latest news surrounding DeepSeek is nothing short of an overcorrection. While the enthusiasm around breakthroughs in AI often drives headlines and market speculation, this feels like yet another case where excitement has outpaced evidence. Investors should be cautious about blindly jumping on the hype train without asking the tough questions." "In summary, while Deepseek’s story is intriguing, it’s imperative to separate fact from speculation. The market needs to temper its enthusiasm and demand more transparency before awarding DeepSeek the crown of AI innovation. Until then, skepticism remains a healthy and necessary stance."

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Title: Ten Greek CEOs making global history
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2025/01/29/ten-greek-ceos-making-global-history/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T09:03:15Z
Full Content:
At a time when the rate of replacement of CEOs in large corporations worldwide has skyrocketed to historic highs (1,800 layoffs or voluntary departures between October 2023 – October 2024 were recently reported by “Financial Times”), Greek or Greek-born CEOs are not only staying in their positions, but new ones are being added. From the most influential across the international business world, such as Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Chase or Ron Vachris of Costco and Albert Bourla of Pfizer, to new entrants such as Duke Energy’s Harry Sideris, the Greeks and Greek heads of multinational conglomerates and national business leaders of major economies, e.g. Germany, Australia, etc, have proved resilient. They have managed to adapt and successfully reshape the business plans of the huge companies they lead in the rapidly changing economic, commercial and business environment. In conditions of long-term inflation, high interest rates, soaring energy costs and constant turmoil in supply chains, Greek leaders are withstanding the relentless competition and moving forward…All of them are writing their own chapter now in international business developments, all over the globe. Their main weapons include excellent training, creative spirit, flexibility and adaptability, as well as strong personal ambition, elements that make up the profile of a successful CEO. Many are quick to associate their successful careers with the Greek DNA, which means combativeness, perseverance in the goal, ability to survive in adverse conditions. What is certain is that these are indeed common elements that are found in everyone’s individual success story. And some of them do justice to their Greek roots, as they exert their influence in the implementation of significant investments in our country. Pierre-Emanuel Angeloglou – LVMH Fashion Group Mr Fendi On March 5, 2024, on the day of his birthday, one of the richest men in the world, Bernard Arnaud called one of his close associates, the Greek-born Pierre-Emanuel Angeloglou, and gave him a great gift: he announced his promotion to CEO of several brands in his empire. He’s the new CEO of LVMH Fashion Group, which houses brands like Fendi, Kenzo, Marc Jacobs, Marc Jacobs, Pucci, Stella McCartney, Patou and Off-White. He comes from L’Oreal, where he rose to the top of its hierarchy as its global general manager in 2017-19. At that time, the company’s active cosmetics business saw record sales growth of +15.5%. In 2019, however, the resourceful Arnaud has thrown him into the deep end at Louis Vuitton as director of strategic missions, in charge of fashion and leather goods. In 2022, he became deputy general manager and executive vice president. His responsibilities include men’s products, where during his tenure revenues soared to €5 billion, as well as women’s accessories, digital innovation, communications, and events. The latter two areas are vital for a company with more than 50 million followers on its Instagram and TikTok accounts. A new surprise for Angeloglou followed. At the end of May last year, it was announced that he was personally taking on the role of CEO of Fendi. And many don’t believe that the next internal restructuring of Louis Vuitton patriarch Bernard Arnaud (who will hold the reins until 2029, before handing it over to his five children) will likely elevate him even higher, to the position of CEO of the giant. After all, he is a “multinational”, as he speaks seven languages, and now has all the necessary credentials. However, he doesn’t speak Greek. Ron Vachis – Costco From forklift driver COSCO, the Chinese giant that manages the port of Piraeus, and Costco, little known in Greece, are separated by just one… “t”. But also an abyss of tens of billions of dollars. The just 42-year-old American retailer is a multinational giant, spread across dozens of countries, with 890 warehouses/stores, operating mainly through the membership/subscriber system and with revenues last year of $254 billion. Third largest global retailer, behind only Walmart and Target Corporation, at No. 12 in the Fortune-500. Its big competitive advantage is its private label products, discount prices and subscription system. And with 333,000 employees, led by a Greek-born, highly capable manager. His name is Ron Vachris. He took over as president and CEO of Costco in January 2024, having previously, for 28 years, worked his way up through all ranks. Starting as a seasonal forklift driver (!) while studying Business Administration at Glendale Community College in Arizona, he climbed all the rungs to the top. He is the epitome of technocratic genius, hard work, perseverance, and immense modesty. “Throughout the company, there are many like me. But there is only one CEO position, so I happened to be in it,” he said recently. Lucky? Costco shareholders (Vanguard Group, BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, and others) probably think differently to set him apart from the rest of the executives at the company, whose doctrine is to elevate its leaders from within. The 60-year-old Vachris works in an office on the 9th floor of Costco’s headquarters, just a little larger than his colleagues. His favorite spot in the new building, in a city of just 40,000 people called “Issaquah,” in Seattle, Washington state, is the ground-floor cafeteria, where he socializes with employees. Last year’s earnings topped $12.5 million. He was born in Staten Island, New York, and moved to Arizona as a teenager. He and his 58-year-old wife, Kim, have two boys, 37 and 33, a daughter, 26, and a granddaughter. Constantina Kanellopoulou – Deutsche Wohnen S.A. Leader in real estate Konstantina Kanellopoulou, 42, has been one of the heavyweights of the German real estate market in recent years. A senior executive at Vonovia for seven years since 2014, she became co-managing director of Deutsche Wohnen S.A. on January 1, 2022, when her company was acquired for €19.1 billion by the country’s real estate leader, which manages more than half a million properties. After a productive stint as co-CEO for DW, she moved in August 2023 to become chairman and CEO at subsidiary GSW Immobilien AG, which celebrated 100 years in business last year. GSW owns around 61,000 residential units in Berlin and is focused on long-term management of rental apartments. Its real estate portfolio is valued at around EUR 3,3 billion. In 2011 it was listed on the Stock Exchange and was acquired by DW two years later. Its Greek head studied business administration at the University of Minster. He worked in Customer Service at Arvato and Deutsche Annington Immobilien, Bochum. And then in 2014 at Vonovia, where the launch came. She believes that climate change and an aging society will shape the housing market in the coming years: ‘The demand for living space is one thing, but we also have to look at how we can renovate that space energy-wise,’ she says. Although she is one of Germany’s most important technocratic personalities, Konstantina Kanellopoulou is projected strictly for her work alone. She is a recognizable face at the opening of a new project or through an interview about the apartment market in the country, a topic that “burns” Germans. Merilyn Paspaley – Paspaley Pearls, Pinctada Hotels & Resorts The Queen of Pearls 74-year-old Marilyn Paspaley started as an actress, but life led her into business. It makes sense, since her father Nicholas Paspalis, starting in the 1930s, managed to build an entire empire on the coast of Western Australia, arriving there from Castellorizo. An empire in the pearl market primarily, Paspaley Pearls, but it expanded into wine, aviation, real estate, and even the “Wall Street Hotel” in New York. At the multinational giant, the successor was Nicholas Paspaley Jr. and his sister Rosalyn Bracher. The second sister, Marilyn, after a career in television series, took the helm of the company. This may have happened without much effort, but it does nothing to diminish Marilyn’s status and successes as CEO of the company. In 2008 she was awarded the Order of Australia for her contribution to the marketing and promotion of Australian-designed pearls and jewellery. She has focused on the development of the hotel market-leading subsidiary Pinctada Hotels & Resorts in the world-class resort of Kimberley in north-western Australia, with a range of ultra-luxury resorts. However, on her frequent European trips she prefers luxury Swiss destinations such as St Moritz. Hari Sideris – Duke Energy The new leader Harry Sideris is the youngest to join the list of the world’s top Greek-born CEOs. The definition of an executive who has fought for three decades very hard, with diligence, consistency, and professionalism, climbing step by step up the ladder of a great energy company like Duke Energy. Raised in Asheville, North Carolina, by Greek immigrant parents, he studied chemical engineering and then charted an upward trajectory at the same company, reaching the presidency last year and, as of April 1 this year, will take over as CEO, succeeding Lynn Goode. The company whose helm the 53-year-old Sideris will keep is no accident. It’s listed on the NYSE, with 121 years of history behind it. Its headquarters are at the Duke Energy Plaza in Charlotte, North Carolina. Other than that it electrifies and supplies natural gas to Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Indiana, South Carolina, Tennessee, Florida, and Puerto Rico. It operates 11 nuclear power plants at six sites in North and South Carolina. With revenues of $29.06 billion in 2023, over 30,000 employees, and nearly 8 million customers, it was ranked as the 141st largest company in the US in 2024, steadily climbing up the rungs of the Fortune 500 list and aiming for the Top 100 this year. Harry Sideris lives in Charlotte with his wife Catherine and their two daughters, Marie and Zoe. Evangelia Wletta – Skyline Equities Realty He “built” Miami Evangelia Gouleta is a first-generation Greek-American businesswoman. Her company’s sales reach over $5 billion in many parts of the US, particularly in the greater Miami area. For a time she was also the “first lady” of New York City, between 1981-82, as the wife of then-state governor Hugh Carey, whom she divorced in 1989. Her parents were originally from Euboea and Santorini, while Guleta was born in Athens during the difficult years of the Occupation. Her family soon immigrated to Chicago where, when she was 17, her father bought a building with 6 apartments. She then gave him $700, which she had saved from jobs she did in the afternoons after school, as a down payment on one of the six apartments and paid the mortgage payment for the remaining amount each month. Today, the demonic Greek is president and CEO of Skyline Equities Realty, a company that acquires, builds, and develops luxury real estate in upscale areas. She has sold tens of thousands of properties and the name “Evangeline” is synonymous with prestigious addresses. Its portfolio includes “Buckingham Plaza” in Chicago, “Barclay Tower” in Denver, “Lafayette” shopping center, “Century of Progress” in Chicago, and “Skyline” on the famous Brickell Avenue, also known as “Millionaire’s Row” in Miami. Goleta is interested in Greece and is involved in many Greek-American organizations, including the Hellenic American Women’s Council (HAWC). In recognition of this quiet contribution, AHEPA Greece honored her at the first AHEPA Awards last December with the Greek American Personality Award for her promotion of Hellenism, dedication to family and personal development, and contributions to social and charitable causes. Jamie Dimon – JP Morgan Chase The most influential When Jamie Dimon speaks about the economy, the stock market, and geopolitical developments, everyone in the US listens intently. His opinion carries weight with the markets, investors, and governments of major countries. His predictions rarely miss. It was his brilliant moves that averted the collapse of Wall Street and the US financial system in the 2008 Lehman Brothers crisis. A legacy that has enshrined him as by far the most influential manager, if not in the world, certainly in American finance. He has led, for the past 20 years, as chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase, the leading US bank, and has repeatedly been included in Time magazine’s annual lists of the “100 most important people in the world”. One of the few managers who became billionaires by receiving staggering pay packages. For years the highest-paid CEO in the US, with an annual salary of $28 million. The 69-year-old third-generation Greek-American Dimon was born in New York to Greek immigrant children. But also bankers. Theodore’s father rose to executive vice president at American Express. Jamie studied psychology and economics at Tufts University and then at Harvard. It was there that he met his future wife Judith Kent. They married in 1983 and had three daughters. After a working stint in consulting firms, in March 2000 Dimon was appointed CEO of Bank One, then the 5th largest bank in the US. When JP Morgan Chase acquired it in July 2004, he became president and chief executive officer of the merged banks. A year later, on December 31, 2005, he became CEO of JPMC and then its chairman. An “unrepentant” banker, though the “sirens” to cross over into the political arena, even running for president, was constant, coming from both camps, Republican and Democrat. His relationship with Trump has gone through forty waves. Sometimes calm, sometimes cloudy. Same with Musk. In the campaign season (for party nominations) Trump, thinking he would support the Democrats, attempted to verbally disparage him. But quickly, when Dimon spoke sympathetically about his policies in 2017-20, he raised eyebrows. He even floated the idea of making him Treasury Secretary. He got no response. However, his key warning about the risk of stagflation in the US if the announcements of increased tariffs are implemented, the planetary leader seems to be ignoring it for now. Dimon does not forget his Greek roots. He is interested in the Greek economy, pushes investments to our country, both JP Morgan and others, and meets frequently with the current Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Albert Bourla – Pfizer The businessman of the pandemic One of the most talked-about faces of the last five years, 64-year-old Albert Bourla, as the pharmaceutical company he heads, Pfizer, was the first, in partnership with BioNTech, to manufacture and distribute billions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Born in Thessaloniki, of Jewish descent, he studied at Aristotle University and obtained a PhD in Biotechnology of Reproduction at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. A professorship at AUTH awaited him, but he was beaten to it by the tempting offer from Pfizer to join its staff. He set off for Athens, but after two years the journey continued to four different countries. In January 2018 he became general manager of operations, in October CEO, and in January 2020 he became executive chairman of the pharmaceutical giant. His international accolades and awards are innumerable. With his name synonymous with the battle against coronavirus, CNN chose him as Businessman of the Year, where he beat out Ilon Musk. Of all the Greek-born CEOs who excel internationally, Bourla is the best known, but also the most… Greek. He lives permanently in New York, but has a home in Halkidiki where he comes for summer vacations with his wife and their two children. Bourla has given a huge boost to Pfizer’s investment in Greece, signalling for other US giants to follow. In October 2021, Pfizer’s Global Digital Innovation Center and Global Operations and Services Center opened in Thessaloniki, creating hundreds of new jobs. Hundreds of hundreds of jobs have been created and hundreds of employees have been employed. Although under his tenure Pfizer’s profits soared, nevertheless a new minority shareholder, the Starboard Value fund, accused him months ago of bad choices that damaged the company and demanded an explanation. However, the operation to reinstate Burla failed. The major shareholders (Vanguard Group, BlackRock, etc.) of the giant fully supported the Greek CEO. Despite this, he remained among the 100 most powerful people in business, according to Fortune, and the most influential in health care, according to Time. While last April he received the American Association for Cancer Research’s Outstanding Achievement Award in San Diego, California. Ted Sarantos – Netflix From the video stores… Third-generation immigrant, Netflix strongman Ted Sarantos, was born in New Jersey and raised in Phoenix, Arizona. His grandfather had emigrated from Samos to the US, also changing his last name from Karyotakis to Sarantos. He gave up his studies in journalism at the University of Arizona to run the video store he worked at when he was in high school. He soon managed to run 8 stores until he became an executive at one of the largest videotape distribution companies in the US, East Texas. By March 2000, Sarantos was vice president of Products and Merchandise for the nearly 500-store chain. His next career move was to join Netflix, which had nothing to do with today’s global streaming giant but was simply a mail-order movie distribution company. Having met then CEO Reed Hastings in March 2000, he took over as Head of Programming and his choices proved to be the key man in its evolution into the powerful conglomerate it is today. The rest is a deafening success story. As of summer 2020, Sarantos was upgraded to co-CEO. He and his first wife Michelle had two children, film producer Sarah Sarandos and film editor Anthony Sarandos. In 2009 he married former US Ambassador to the Bahamas Nicole Avant, daughter of former Motown chairman Clarence Avant. They now live in Hancock Park, Los Angeles. A staunch Democratic supporter and interlocutor of former President Barack Obama. He frequently visits Greece for business and vacations. In July 2022, he even became the recipient of Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s desire to have a successful Greek-language series on Netflix, during a discussion at the Herodesion at an Endeavor Greece event. Among other things, the two men discussed the prospects of Greece becoming a country for film and series production. Michelle Dukeris – AB InBev The King of Beer Greek-Brazilian, eminent technocrat, currently based in Belgium and the city of Leuven, “King of Beer”. This is briefly the profile of 52-year-old Michel Dukkeris who respects and honours his motherland, namely Greece. And he often declares himself proud of his Greek roots. From July 2021 he will lead the management of the world’s largest brewery, AB InBev, with over 150,000 employees in 24 countries. Born in Lagos, Brazil, the son of a first-generation Greek immigrant, a chemical engineering graduate from the Federal University of Santa Catarina, and with a rich post-graduate background in management in the US, he joined AB InBev in 1996. He worked first in Latin America and then as the company’s head of China and Asia-Pacific for seven years. The first achievement was a 400% jump in corporate revenue. He was promoted to head of global sales and then CEO of North America, where he took the company from loss to profit. All this led him to the top of the hierarchy of the giant that has 400 brands under its umbrella, including Budweiser, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck’s, Leffe,and others. An earlier Financial Times feature on Dukkeris said he was fascinated by China’s five-year growth programs and adopted their philosophy in his business strategy. He operated the company based on a ten-year growth plan, always aiming to stay ahead of its competitors. From the result, he was vindicated. Among his major successes, he drastically cut costs to reduce the company’s debts, which when he took over the helm amounted to $80 billion. “Every dollar counts,” he says, asking every regional manager to justify every single expense, even the paper for the printer. The severe cost-cutting has saved thousands of positions for the company’s staff. It also credits the implementation of AB InBev’s first e-commerce platform, where it also increased sales.

Title: Trump is turning the fate of TikTok into a public bidding war

President Donald Trump apparently has no qualms about turning the fate of TikTok into a public bidding war. When prompted by specific questions from reporters, the new president tossed out some of the biggest names in the tech world as possible buyers of TikTok’s US operations — a deal that would allow the platform to get around a ban imposed by Congress in the name of national security. Among the names floated so far by Trump are Elon Musk, owner of X; Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle (ORCL); and Microsoft (MSFT). It's not yet clear if any are involved in actual discussions. "I like bidding wars because you make your best deals," Trump said Monday as he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One. Trump said he wants a deal done in 30 days. An executive order he signed on his first day in office actually gives TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, until April 4 to figure something out. Here is a closer look at the big names mentioned by Trump — and others who have also gone public with their bids: Microsoft, along with Walmart (WMT), made a failed bid for TikTok during Trump’s first term when Trump actually tried to ban the app. When asked Monday if Microsoft was among the companies interested this time around in an ownership stake, Trump answered in the affirmative: "I would say yes." It is not yet known whether Microsoft is actually involved in any talks. Microsoft’s prior bid in 2020 didn’t go anywhere. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella later said after those discussions fell apart that the federal government had a "particular set of requirements and then it just disappeared." He called it the "strangest thing I've ever worked on." The Chinese government will certainly have a say in whatever happens. And government officials in that country, according to reports by Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the social media app’s US business to Musk. Trump sounded intrigued by the idea when asked about it publicly. "I would be if he wanted to buy it," Trump said of Musk, the owner of X when a reporter at the White House wanted to know if he was in favor of such a deal. But Musk has not spoken on the subject yet, except to say on X, “I have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech. That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change." Antitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users. Another factor in his favor is that Musk has a close relationship with the incoming president, having spent more than $250 million supporting his reelection campaign and as he is helping lead a government cost-cutting effort as part of a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He also runs an electric vehicle company, Tesla (TSLA), that has a factory in China and sells a lot of its cars to that part of the world. Trump has sent mixed signals about whether Ellison could play a role in the TikTok situation. "I’d like Larry to buy it too," the president said last week, with Ellison standing next to him at a press conference held to announce a new $500 billion artificial intelligence infrastructure commitment. "Larry, let’s negotiate in front of the media,” Trump said, as SoftBank CEO Masa Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also looked on. "What I’m thinking about saying to somebody is, buy it, and give half to the United States of America. Half, and we’ll give you the permit. And they’ll have a great partner, the United States." "Sounds like a good deal to me, Mr. President," Ellison said. NPR later reported that the Trump administration was developing a plan that would move control of TikTok to Oracle, where Ellison is chair and chief technology officer, along with other outside investors. In that scenario, ByteDance would keep a minority stake in the company while Oracle would oversee the app’s algorithm and data collection. Oracle already acts as a service provider for TikTok, storing its videos and other content in data centers. But Trump denied talks with Oracle when asked about the subject Sunday. "No, not with Oracle. Numerous people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it and I will make that decision probably over the next 30 days." He also denied any actual discussions with Ellison, saying "I never spoke to Larry about TikTok." Another bidder in the mix not yet mentioned by Trump is Perplexity AI, an artificial intelligence startup backed by some Big Tech names: Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Nvidia (NVDA), and other venture capitalists. The AP reported this past weekend that Perplexity AI submitted a proposal to ByteDance that would merge Perplexity with TikTok’s US business and then give half ownership in that new company to the US government following an initial public offering. The AP also reported that TikTok’s US business would be merged with Perplexity AI without the platform’s proprietary algorithm, and the existing investors in ByteDance would receive equity in the new entity. One ByteDance board member, General Atlantic CEO Bill Ford, told Axios last week during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that there could be a solution for TikTok that does not require a full divesture from ByteDance. General Atlantic, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), Sequoia Capital, and Susquehanna International Group are among the existing US investors in TikTok’s parent company. Former US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who acknowledged last year he was assembling a team of investors to buy TikTok, said last weekend on Fox News’s "Sunday Morning Futures" that a new investor would "dilute down" Chinese ownership of TikTok. "I’d be very interested in participating," he said. Another billionaire interested in a potential TikTok deal is Frank McCourt, the founder of the internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers. "There's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business," McCourt has told Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid podcast. "We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it." His group includes "Shark Tank" star Kevin O’Leary, who has told Yahoo Finance that he, McCourt, and a consortium of business professionals are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a "legacy opportunity." The famed investor told Yahoo Finance that the group’s proposal excludes the platform’s algorithm. McCourt told Reuters last week at Davos that he is open to teaming up with other investors. O’Leary is also still interested, he told CNBC, but the law banning TikTok, which went into effect on Jan. 19, makes things more difficult. "I would love to do a deal if the law provided for it, but I don’t have the luxury of breaching the order of Congress," he said to CNBC. One other group of investors has publicly announced its interest in buying TikTok, and it claims to have an internet celebrity in its corner. It includes Jesse Tinsley, founder and CEO of Employer.com. The web celebrity is Jimmy Donaldson, the popular YouTuber better known as "MrBeast." The group submitted an all-cash bid, according to a release from Paul Hastings LLP, which said it is representing the investors. The Paul Hastings team includes Brad Bondi, brother of Pam Bondi, Trump’s pick to be attorney general of the US. Tinsley said on X that "our goal is to ensure TikTok stays accessible, thriving, and aligned with the values that make America great," he wrote. His group, he added, is "ready to structure the deal in whatever way President Trump and our government wish."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against other safe stocks to buy for the long term in 2025. The US stock market is often regarded as one of the most reliable and resilient financial markets in the world. With its deep liquidity, broad participation, and historical ability to recover from downturns, it has long been a cornerstone of wealth creation for individual and institutional investors. While it is subject to short-term volatility, its long-term performance and structural advantages make it a reliable platform for investment. It has a proven track record of delivering strong returns over the long term. The S&P 500, a benchmark index that represents the performance of 500 large-cap US companies, has averaged an annual return of approximately 10% since its inception in 1926. While short-term fluctuations are inevitable, the market’s historical trajectory has been one of growth, driven by corporate innovation, economic expansion, and rising consumer demand.

For example, after the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, the S&P 500 recovered within six months and went on to hit record levels, underscoring its resilience.

Czech National Bank Governor Ales Michl said in an interview with Financial Times (FT) that he will present a bitcoin investment plan to the board on Thursday, which, if approved, could see the apex bank diversify 5% of its $146.13 billion reserves into the leading cryptocurrency by market value. "For the diversification of our assets, bitcoin seems good," Michl said, according to an interview published by the FT and quoted by Reuters. Michl pointed to broader investor interest in the cryptocurrency since BlackRock and others debuted spot ETFs a year ago. "An asset under consideration is Bitcoin. It currently has zero correlation to bonds and is an interesting asset for a large portfolio. Worth considering. Right now, it’s only at the stage of analysis and discussion. The Bank Board decides, and no decision is imminent. Thoughtful analysis is needed," Michl said in a statement on X. "Bitcoin has significant volatility, which makes it harder to take advantage of its current low correlation with other assets. That’s why I will ask our team on Thursday to further assess Bitcoin’s potential role in our reserves. Nothing more, nothing less," he added.

Title: Who to watch in Ireland's U20 Six Nations campaign

Eanna McCarthy, Michael Foy, Henry Walker and Ciaran Mangan at Ireland Men's U20s squad announcement Ireland will aim to banish the heartbreak of missing out on a third successive Grand Slam in this year's Under-20 Six Nations. Neil Doak has named a 31-man squad after being appointed head coach in December, with England - the team who denied them a third straight clean sweep last year - first up on 30 January. There has been a proven pathway in recent years from age-grade level to the senior side. Look no further than Sam Prendergast, a player who won a Grand Slam with the under-20s in 2023 and now finds himself fighting for Ireland's 10 jersey in this year's Six Nations. As we look ahead to this year's tournament, BBC Sport NI picks five players who might catch the eye for Ireland's youngsters. Eanna McCarthy will captain Ireland at this year's U20's Six Nations Championship Province: Connacht Club: Galwegians Age: 19 Position: Back row While he may be a new face in the side, and donning the title of captain, Eanna McCarthy is no stranger to responsibility. Before heading to the west coast over the summer to join the Connacht academy, Cork native McCarthy captained the Munster Under-19s through their 2024 campaign, defeating both Ulster and Connacht. At club level, McCarthy has been a regular name on the team sheet for Galwegians RFC, who play in the All-Ireland League [AIL] Division 2B. Alongside his leadership qualities, McCarthy is praised for his work rate on and off the ball, bringing physicality in his attack and defence, something which Doak will look to utilise throughout the campaign. Alex Usanov played for Emerging Ireland in October's tour of South Africa Province: Leinster Club: Clontarf Age: 19 Position: Prop Alex Usanov is one of the six members in the current squad who returns to the fold for a second consecutive year, and it is fair to say he's been busy since then. A player credited for his physicality and power in the scrum, the Leinster academy prop was included in the Emerging Ireland squad in October, gaining valuable minutes and experience along the way against three tough South African sides. For the past two seasons, Usanov's had huge involvement at AIL Division 1A side Clontarf, and his contribution's have been crucial in the sides challenge for top spot. They currently sit two points behind league leaders St. Mary's College. Some years before his rise in Irish Rugby, Usanov was a successful martial arts competitor. He became All-Ireland champion for Judo in 2018 and 2019, a sport which he believes taught him different disciplines. Hooker Henry Walker returns for a second year hoping to claim an U20 Six Nations medal Province: Ulster Club: Queen's University Age: 19 Position: Hooker Another returning face to the side is hooker Henry Walker. Just like his front row partner Usanov, Walker was involved in last year's Championship, and was unlucky to miss out on selection for the Junior World Cup last summer due to injury. The former Hartpury College player has progressed into year two of the Academy at Ulster and has impressed in appearances for his local side QUB who find themselves seventh in AIL Division 1B. A dynamic hooker who plays a physical game with or without the ball, he too shows the qualities of a leader having captained the under-20s to a win in a friendly against Italy in December. He will no doubt look to push Ireland all the way this time after narrowly missing out last year. Leinster academy centre Connor Fahy splits the Italian defence in a friendly Province: Leinster Club: Clontarf Age: 19 Position: Centre A product of his local team Wexford Wanderers, Connor Fahy is certainly an exciting prospect. Playing for club side Clontarf in AIL Division 1A, Fahy provides a powerful outlet at Doak's disposal in the centre of the pitch. As another graduate of the Leinster academy, Fahy featured in the IRFU 150th 'A' Interprovincial Championship last November against Munster 'A'. Versatility is a key component to his game, with the capability to cover inside and outside centre. As physical player who promises to cross the gainline, there is no doubt he can create a problem for defenders. Ciaran Mangan faced his brother in a pre-tournament friendly December Province: Leinster Club: Blackrock College Age: 19 Position: Centre A versatile back who can cover centre and both wings, Ciaran Mangan is expected to cause plenty of problems for any opposition. Credited for his electric pace on the ball, accompanied with a strong work ethic, Mangan has also found himself in the centre of the park for AIL Division 1B side Blackrock College. This type of flexibility might be of use to Doak, who may look to deploy a player of Mangan's quality across the backline, rather than tying him to one position. Another product of the Leinster Academy, Ciaran faced his older brother Diarmuid in a final warm-up game against Leinster 'A' ahead of Doak's squad announcement. Diarmuid, who has featured for the Leinster senior team over the past two seasons, was involved with the under-20s side who won back to back Grand Slams in 2022 and 2023.

Title: DeepSeek Send Panic Shivers Down the US AI Industry

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Key Takeaways A new Chinese AI model has taken the world by storm. Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has just released the latest version of its open-source AI model – DeepSeek V3, and it’s better than the latest ChatGPT 4.0, Llama3, and Claude AI models. In fact, in some areas, it even surpasses its rivals. To add a cherry to the top, its training and development cost is just a fraction of that of its rivals. Where giants like OpenAI and Meta have pumped billions of dollars into data centers and AI training, DeepSeek has built a model from scratch for just $5.5M. The US stock market bore the brunt of this new breakthrough, wiping off $1 trillion for investors in a single day. Nvidia was the most affected stock – it fell almost 17% in a day. Nvidia investors saw $593B vaporize into thin air – the single biggest market cap loss for a company on Wall Street. Nvidia’s whole business is centered around selling massively expensive GPUs at 80-90% margins. In contrast, DeepSeek built the whole model on around 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs. DeepSeek has rocked the belief that the AI industry is a capital-intensive one and only big corporation giants can participate in it. As per reports, DeepSeek uses efficient computing techniques such as a “mixture of experts” approach to lower the cost. Now that the industry knows similar results can be achieved with a fraction of resources, the whole AI chip industry business may falter. The only downside might be that the model is trained on data up to October 2023. But this is only for the web version. The app seems to have access to the latest information. DeepSeek stepping foot into the industry has sent the rest of the players into a frenzy. As per an inside source, the generative artificial intelligence division of Meta is in “panic mode”. Engineers are moving frantically to dissect DeepSeek and copy anything and everything we can from it. I’m not even exaggerating. – Meta employee The biggest worry of the management right now is how they will justify the massive cost of their tools and the massive salary that their “leaders” are drawing when China has managed to create an equally competent tool at such a low price. Even President Donald Trump praised DeepSeek in a speech at a Republican retreat, applauding its technological breakthrough and saying it should be a wake-up call for American companies. OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman seemed to be a little more calm in his response. He took to X and said that it was quite “invigorating” to have new competitors in the market. He also applauded the company for delivering that kind of service for such a low cost and in the end, promised to speed up some of OpenAI’s own releases. It might seem that DeepSeek is the next big thing. And it might be so, considering that it has already become the No.1 downloaded free app on Apple’s app store. Its open-source model makes its codes and technical details open to all. This might also speed up progress through collaboration. But there are some hurdles in the way. For instance, so far the tool censors all topics that are not favored by the Chinese government. However, the question is how viable this approach will be if it tries to make it big in the global market. Plus, China is not on good terms with many of its neighbors. We have all seen how it went down for TikTok. So in this environment, will DeepSeek manage to survive or will it sink after this banging launch?

Title: Stock market today: Asian stocks advance ahead of the Fed's rate decision as panic over AI fades

Asian stocks have advanced in thin Lunar New Year trading following a rebound on Wall Street driven by tech stocks as the panic over Chinese AI company DeepSeek faded HONG KONG -- Asian stocks advanced Wednesday in thin Lunar New Year trading following a rebound on Wall Street driven by tech stocks as the panic over Chinese AI company DeepSeek faded. Most markets in Asia were closed for holidays. Investors were focusing on the Federal Reserve’s rate decision due later in the day. U.S. futures were flat and oil prices fell. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index recovered from Tuesday's losses, gaining 0.7% to 39,273.49. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.7% to 8,455.70 after data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed the Consumer Price Index increased by 0.2% in the December 2024 quarter, marking the smallest rise since the June 2020 quarter, when inflation declined during the COVID-19 outbreak. India's Sensex was up 0.5%, while the SET in Bangkok shed 0.2%. On Tuesday, tech stocks bounced back after tumbling Monday on doubts over whether the artificial-intelligence frenzy really needs all the dollars being poured into it. The S&P 500 climbed 0.9% to 6,067.70, clawing back more than half of its earlier drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3% to 44,850.35, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 2% to 19,733.59 after sliding 3.1 % the day before. The spotlight remained on Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the move into AI and whose stock has become a symbol of the surrounding frenzy. It rose 8.8% after plunging nearly 17% on Monday, which was its worst drop since the 2020 COVID crash. Other AI-related companies also held steadier, including chip company Broadcom, which rose 2.6%. Constellation Energy picked up 1.4% after plummeting nearly 21% on Monday. It had earlier rallied on expectations it will help supply the electricity that vast AI data centers would gobble up. Such revenues are threatened after DeepSeek, a Chinese company, said it was able to develop a large language model that can perform as well as big U.S. rivals but at a fraction of the cost. That raises questions about whether all the spending expected for AI chips and electricity will need to happen. AI-related stocks have been Wall Street’s biggest stars in recent years, soaring on expectations that big spending will only continue to grow. The gains, though, also created criticism that the stock prices had simply gone too high, too fast. It’s still uncertain how much DeepSeek’s development will upend the AI industry. While it could mean less growth in spending than expected for data centers, electricity and chips, it could also boost other areas. “If AI becomes less expensive to use, we think businesses will adopt it more quickly, making a greater investment in AI software,” according to James Egelhof, chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas. “We think this acceleration in adoption could mean a rise in software investment that offsets – or even dwarfs – any deceleration in spending on data center structures, hardware and related investment.” Some of Wall Street’s most influential companies, including Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla, will release profit reports later this week. A report showing confidence among U.S. consumers wasn’t as strong as economists expected made relatively small waves in the bond market. The more anticipated event will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision on interest rates. The widespread expectation is that it will leave the federal funds rate alone. If that proves true, it would be the first meeting where the Fed did not cut rates to give the economy a boost since it began doing so in September. In other dealings Wednesday, benchmark U.S. crude shed 14 cents to $73.63 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 18 cents to $76.31 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 155.09 Japanese yen from 155.53 yen. The euro cost $1.0438, down from $1.0432. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

(Reuters) - Czech National Bank Governor Ales Michl said that he will present a plan to the central bank's board to invest in bitcoin and added that it was "very likely" the bank would cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week, according to an interview published by the Financial Times on Wednesday. Michl said he will present the plan to the board on Thursday, and if approved, the bank could eventually hold as much as 5% of its 140 billion euro ($146.13 billion) reserves in bitcoin, according to the FT. "For the diversification of our assets, bitcoin seems good,” he said. He added that bitcoin would trend higher even without the backing of U.S. President Donald Trump since it's an alternative investment for many people. Bitcoin hit a record high earlier this month when Trump, who has pledged to be a "crypto president," was sworn in. It has more than doubled in value in 2024, driven by the U.S. market regulator's approval for exchange-traded funds tied to its spot price, and optimism over easing regulatory hurdles under Trump. Michl, too, highlighted wider investor interest in bitcoin since BlackRock and other firms last year launched bitcoin exchange traded funds, according to the FT.

Title: Continuity Sinn Féin the order of the day as Mary Lou McDonald sticks with her tried and trusted

The great purge of Parnell Square turned out to be a weak Milk of Magnesia effort in the end. In an interview before Christmas, Mary Lou McDonald promised a “significant reshuffle” at parliamentary party level come the new year. “Nobody is in a position indefinitely,” declared the woman who became leader of Sinn Féin once Gerry Adams decided to step down after 34 years in charge. Certainly, her party has never been found wanting over the years when justifying why nobody is indispensable. So news she was about to announce her new front bench prompted much speculation about blood on the carpet in Kevin Barry Memorial Hall. That struggle never materialised. Reports of a big clear-out of familiar faces were greatly exaggerated. It seems Mary Lou was gilding the Easter Lily when she made her Yuletide prediction. The new front bench is remarkably like the old one. Having feasted on the red meat of Dáil Éireann in tumult last week, political reporters had been hoping she could keep the carnage going with this “significant” switcheroo. But all she delivered was a minor tweaking of the usual cast of characters. Longford-Westmeath’s Sorca Clarke was the only one dropped while two first-time deputies – Donna McGettigan (Clare) and Joanna Byrne (Louth) – joined the team. Consolation may come soon for erstwhile frontbencher Sorca. “When the Government appoints junior spokespersons we will follow suit,” said her leader during Tuesday’s disappointing unveiling in the Alex Hotel near Leinster House. The list of new Minister of State is out on Wednesday. This should bring some relief to a nation battling to cope with the aftermath of Storm Éowyn while simultaneously fretting over who will get what consolation prize for missing out on a seat at the Cabinet table. Or maybe not. Because, let’s face it, nobody is that bothered. So back to Mary Lou and her still in situ stalwarts, who found themselves in this hotel meeting room at the last minute because rain forced them to abandon plans to hold the event outside on the Leinster House plinth. But in a nice twist, the four-star Alex is situated on Fenian Street. So they felt very much at home. Not to be outdone by the Shinners, the new Coalition of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Michael Lowry’s leg is now frantically searching for a venue on Tribunal Street, Balls-up Boulevard or Audacity Avenue to host its ceremonial roll-out of the Juniors. On Fenian Street, there was wasn’t enough time to set out tables for display purposes so the new old front bench stood in two lines in the middle of the parquet floor behind Mary Lou. There was more than enough space for everyone to launch into an impromptu Walls of Limerick. Instead, the party leader took to a small lectern and made a “simple pledge to the working people of Ireland”. An evocative reminder of the working people stood at the end of the first line. For it was Eoin Ó Broin, the party’s Blackrock College educated spokesman on housing, poignantly wearing the honest workwear of the toiling Irish navvy from the last century – a black donkey-jacket with distinctive leatherette patches on each shoulder. [ The Michael Lowry issue is still unresolved and may escalate. GUBU’s the word for itOpens in new window ] English comedians of old used to joke about Paddy being asked the meaning of the word “fascinate”. And Paddy would say “Oi, I have 10 buttons on me donkey-jacket but I can only fasten eight”. Mary Lou’s simple pledge to the working people was to guarantee that Sinn Féin “will be up and at it from day one, working for you, non-stop”. As for Eoin, the toil never stops either. He kept his portfolio in the mini-shuffle as did high-profile performers Pearse O’Doherty (finance), David Cullinane (health), Mairéad O’Farrell (public expenditure and reform) and Claire Kerrane (children, disability and equality). Sinn Féin’s top team may have hit the ground running, but Mary Lou called out the Government for going straight into a two-week recess as soon as it was reinstalled after the long break for Christmas and the general election. Why do they need extra-time to familiarise themselves with the job? “They have no excuse now: they’ve been in Government forever. At least it feels like forever.” But never mind. Sinn Féin will get straight down to business when they “come back off their holibops”. In the meantime, the row over the Regional Independent group and its controversial Stroke Whisperer demanding Opposition speaking time rumbles on. “Michael Lowry simply will not be allowed to masquerade as an Opposition TD,” said the Sinn Féin leader, stressing that the combined Opposition remains firmly united on this issue. And speaking of working together, what does she make of the call from Labour’s Ivana Bacik for parties on the left to consider nominating an agreed candidate to contest the presidential election later this year? “It would make sense to have a joint approach, if that’s possible,” said Mary Lou. But the party has yet to discuss finding a successor to Michael D Higgins. “Who ever gets elected will have big shoes to fill.” Our politics team's behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

Title: Elon Musk’s DOGE explores use of blockchain to revolutionize government spending and transparency

Elon Musk, head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is exploring the use of blockchain technology to track and manage U.S. government expenditures, aiming to enhance transparency, secure data, streamline payments and build management. This initiative aligns with Musk's mission to eliminate trillions of dollars from the federal budget and ensure accountability, building on proposals like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 2024 idea to put the entire federal budget on a blockchain for public scrutiny. DOGE officially launched on Jan. 21, with the goal of modernizing federal technology and software. The department, created by an executive order from President Trump, is tasked with identifying spending cuts and delivering recommendations by July 4, 2026. While blockchain offers potential benefits, experts warn of the complexities and challenges in applying it to a large, complex entity like the U.S. government. Issues include loss of control with public blockchains and the sufficiency of conventional databases for similar tasks. Despite concerns, some institutions have successfully implemented blockchain for specific purposes, such as the California DMV and BlackRock. If DOGE proceeds, it would be the largest government blockchain project in U.S. history, reflecting the administration's commitment to using advanced technology to tackle inefficiency and waste.

If DOGE proceeds, it would be the largest government blockchain project in U.S. history, reflecting the administration's commitment to using advanced technology to tackle inefficiency and waste. In a bold move to modernize federal operations and curb wasteful spending, Elon Musk, head of the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is reportedly exploring using blockchain technology to track and manage U.S. government expenditures. According to sources familiar with the discussions, the initiative aims to enhance transparency, secure sensitive data, streamline payments and build management. This effort aligns with Musk's mission to eliminate trillions of dollars from the federal budget and ensure accountability in government operations. The discussions, which have included consultations with representatives from public blockchain networks, mark a significant step in the Trump administration's push to integrate digital assets into federal systems. While the initiative is still in its early stages, it has already sparked debate about the feasibility and necessity of using blockchain for such large-scale government projects. The idea of leveraging blockchain technology to increase government transparency is not new. In April 2024, former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. proposed putting the entire federal budget on a blockchain, allowing citizens to scrutinize every expenditure in real-time. "Every American can look at every budget item in the entire budget, anytime they want, 24 hours a day," Kennedy told a rally in Michigan. "We are going to have 300 million eyeballs on our budget. If somebody is spending $16,000 for a toilet seat, everybody will know about it." Kennedy's proposal resonated with small-government advocates and fiscal conservatives, who have long criticized the federal government's unchecked spending. Musk's initiative appears to build on this momentum, with the DOGE exploring how blockchain could be used not only to track spending but also to secure data, facilitate payments and manage federal infrastructure. DOGE takes its first steps The DOGE officially launched its website on Jan. 21, adopting the logo of Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that inspired its name. The move caused a brief surge in Dogecoin's price, which rose approximately 11 percent to $0.38 following the announcement. However, the department's mission extends far beyond memes and cryptocurrencies. Created by an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 20, DOGE is tasked with modernizing federal technology and software to maximize efficiency and productivity. The department is expected to work closely with the White House Office of Management and Budget to identify spending cuts and deliver recommendations by July 4, 2026. Musk has already enlisted about 100 volunteers to write code for his projects, signaling his commitment to rapid implementation. The blockchain initiative is one of several technological tools being considered to reduce costs, eliminate fraud and address the ballooning federal deficit â a key issue Trump campaigned on in 2024. While the potential benefits of blockchain technology are clear, experts caution that applying it to an entity as vast and complex as the U.S. government is uncharted territory. Sam Hammond, chief economist at the Foundation for American Innovation, noted that "an internal government blockchain could be used to track spending, documents and contracts in a way that's fully secure and transparent." However, he questioned whether blockchain is necessary for such tasks, given that conventional databases can achieve similar results with fewer complications. Public blockchains, like those used by Bitcoin and Solana, present additional challenges. Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University, pointed out that "one issue with the government using a public blockchain is that they would have no control over the entries. I think that loss of control would be a problem for governments." Despite these concerns, some institutions have successfully implemented blockchain technology for specific purposes. For example, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has digitized millions of car titles on the Avalanche blockchain and BlackRock has issued a money-market fund on several cryptocurrency ledgers. If DOGE moves forward with its blockchain initiative, it would represent the largest government project of its kind in U.S. history. The effort underscores the Trump administration's commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology to address longstanding issues of inefficiency and waste. (Related: Bitcoin's bull run may extend into 2025, but regulatory shifts and market indicators suggest caution.) However, the road ahead is fraught with challenges. Previous attempts by large corporations to implement blockchain solutions have often stalled due to governance issues and the discovery that existing database technologies are often more cost-effective. As Hammond noted, "The question is whether you really need a blockchain to do that, since conventional databases can be used in a similar way and with fewer downsides."

This effort aligns with Musk's mission to eliminate trillions of dollars from the federal budget and ensure accountability in government operations. The discussions, which have included consultations with representatives from public blockchain networks, mark a significant step in the Trump administration's push to integrate digital assets into federal systems. While the initiative is still in its early stages, it has already sparked debate about the feasibility and necessity of using blockchain for such large-scale government projects. The idea of leveraging blockchain technology to increase government transparency is not new. In April 2024, former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. proposed putting the entire federal budget on a blockchain, allowing citizens to scrutinize every expenditure in real-time. "Every American can look at every budget item in the entire budget, anytime they want, 24 hours a day," Kennedy told a rally in Michigan. "We are going to have 300 million eyeballs on our budget. If somebody is spending $16,000 for a toilet seat, everybody will know about it." Kennedy's proposal resonated with small-government advocates and fiscal conservatives, who have long criticized the federal government's unchecked spending. Musk's initiative appears to build on this momentum, with the DOGE exploring how blockchain could be used not only to track spending but also to secure data, facilitate payments and manage federal infrastructure. DOGE takes its first steps The DOGE officially launched its website on Jan. 21, adopting the logo of Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that inspired its name. The move caused a brief surge in Dogecoin's price, which rose approximately 11 percent to $0.38 following the announcement.

The blockchain initiative is one of several technological tools being considered to reduce costs, eliminate fraud and address the ballooning federal deficit â a key issue Trump campaigned on in 2024. While the potential benefits of blockchain technology are clear, experts caution that applying it to an entity as vast and complex as the U.S. government is uncharted territory. Sam Hammond, chief economist at the Foundation for American Innovation, noted that "an internal government blockchain could be used to track spending, documents and contracts in a way that's fully secure and transparent." However, he questioned whether blockchain is necessary for such tasks, given that conventional databases can achieve similar results with fewer complications. Public blockchains, like those used by Bitcoin and Solana, present additional challenges. Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University, pointed out that "one issue with the government using a public blockchain is that they would have no control over the entries. I think that loss of control would be a problem for governments." Despite these concerns, some institutions have successfully implemented blockchain technology for specific purposes.

Title: Jim Cramer Says Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)’s ‘No Longer A Cyclical’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: Top 14 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) stands against the other stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the upcoming earnings season, emphasizing that investors should tread carefully and avoid making any big moves. “When people think about an exciting time for stocks, they think of the next two weeks, that's when some of the most important consequential companies on Earth report, practically at the same time. Throw in the actions of the new president and all I can say is, we're not gonna have any idea what the heck we're doing until we have time, probably at night to sift through all the data points and study all the conference calls.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks Cramer stressed that the current week, in particular, is too difficult for snap judgments. He warned that the Federal Reserve’s decision on Wednesday will only add to the uncertainty. At one point, it seemed like the market could expect a rate cut, which would push stocks higher, but then Amex reported that its customers were spending at a rapid pace. He said: “But when American Express says today that its millions of customers are spending like mad, the Fed can't possibly give us a rate cut, can it?” He added that if the Fed does lower rates on Wednesday, it would likely be because Chairman Jerome Powell has caved to President Trump’s demand for immediate cuts. In this complex situation, Cramer advised investors to just sit tight and not act, pointing out that it would be a “no-win situation” for Powell. As if the pressure of earnings reports and the Fed's decision were not enough, Cramer also noted that this week would feature the release of the Fed’s favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. However, Cramer does not expect good news, given the high level of consumer spending. “The exhausting bottom line: Look it’s a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be. Like I always say, don’t try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen. It's too hard and I don't want you to lose money just because this is one of eight super exciting weeks of the year.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 24. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A construction crew operating a hydraulic shovel during a nighttime project. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50 Ahead of Caterpillar Inc.’s (NYSE:CAT) announcement of its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results on January 30, Cramer said: “Thursday morning starts with Caterpillar, which is a conference call stock, meaning you can't make a decision until you hear the call because that's where you learn about the future. I think the stock's had an amazing run, but CAT’s no longer a cyclical, it's a secular grower because CEO, Jim Umpleby has maneuvered its business into more consistent end markets.” Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a leading global manufacturer and seller of heavy machinery and equipment, focusing on industries like construction, mining, and transportation. Previously, Cramer has called CAT a “Great Fed rate cut stock”. On January 13, analysts at financial services firm Evercore ISI upgraded the company stock from an Underperform rating to In Line following a survey of dealers in the construction equipment and heavy machinery sectors. David Raso, managing director and analyst at Evercore ISI, noted in a January 12 report that "Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is somewhat relying on price to move equipment, but it’s generally working." He added that Caterpillar dealers' six-month sales and purchasing forecasts are above the industry survey’s average. Additionally, Evercore ISI found that while new inventory remains above the industry average, it is gradually declining. However, used inventory has increased, which they attribute to weaker pricing for both new and used equipment compared to the industry survey’s average. Overall CAT ranks 10th on our list of stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of CAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Faces Securities Class Action After Weight Loss Therapy Trial Data Disappoints, Analyst Questions Trial’s Design – Hagens Berman

January 28, 2025 22:10 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Title: Taiwan may offer help for industry over Trump tariff threats

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's government will soon look at whether it needs to help its domestic industry over threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to put tariffs on semiconductors, Premier Cho Jung-tai said on Wednesday. Home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the island is a key link in the global technology supply chain for companies such as Apple and Nvidia. Trump said on Monday he plans to impose tariffs on imported chips, pharmaceuticals and steel to get the producers to make them in the United States. Responding to a question on Trump's remarks, Cho said the economy ministry and other departments have been paying close attention to the "developments of the past few days". "In a day or two we will urgently look at whether we need to make more cooperative plans and future assistance programmes for the industrial sector," he added. "I would like to reassure our compatriots that Taiwan's position in the world's industrial chain is not to be ignored, and that we will continue to maintain such an advantage." Taiwan has to continue to strive for more cooperation externally and to maintain its leadership in the industrial and technological sectors, Cho added. In 2020, under the first Trump administration, TSMC announced that it would build a $12 billion factory in Arizona in a win for efforts by the U.S. government to wrestle global tech supply chains back from China. It later boosted those plans with the total investment now standing at $65 billion. TSMC has declined to comment on Trump's latest tariff remarks. This month, Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said he only expected a small impact from any tariffs imposed by Trump on semiconductor exports given their technological superiority. In another potential challenge for Taiwan, Trump last week directed federal agencies to investigate persistent U.S. trade deficits and unfair trade practices and alleged currency manipulation by other countries. Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States surged 83% last year compared with 2023, with exports to the U.S. hitting a record $111.4 billion driven by demand for high-tech products such as semiconductors.

Title: JOHN STOSSEL: Woke ESG Culture Going Down In Flames During Trump Era

Time Published: 2025-01-29T02:18:54Z

“Sustainability” investments became popular a few years back. So-called experts said companies shouldn’t just focus on profit. They should put more effort into being “nice.” Funds pushing ESG (environmental, social and governance) were all the rage. Giant investment firms like BlackRock pressured companies to hire more women and minorities. CEO Larry Fink announced, “All investments are going to be looked through sustainability.” But “sustainability” is a mostly meaningless word. Parnassus claimed it helped meet UN sustainability goals of “nutrition” and “sanitation” by investing in U.S. Foods and Clorox. Starbucks phased out plastic straws while adding lids that used more plastic. BP rebranded itself as “Beyond Petroleum.” Wisely, it mostly invested in petroleum. Former Vice President Al Gore made money peddling climate change hysteria. He created “sustainability investment funds,” claiming “sustainability factors … actually enhance returns!” His funds did enhance Gore’s own returns; he made millions. But over the past three years, his “sustainable” fund underperformed the stock market. Recently the fund managers admitted they “made investment mistakes.” Most funds promoting “sustainable investment” did worse than the market. So, why did trillions of dollars pour into such funds? “Because of pressures,” says Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Investments. “Their largest clients are blue states’ pension (funds) like CalPERS and the New York pension (fund) who put pressure on them: ‘Adopt these agendas or you’re going to lose us as your largest customer!'” CalPERS still brags about “mitigating climate risk” and adding “climate-conscious board members” to Exxon’s board. Presidential climate envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks. Today, banks and even Blackrock are running from sustainability nonsense. “What you’re seeing,” says Cole, “is ESG funds shuttering at record speed … and they’re not apologizing.” Progressives never do. This fad didn’t just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel’s competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about “sustainability.” Intel’s website lists endless ESG goals like “environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet.” It even brags about “green software” … whatever that is. That’s a lot of energy spent making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline. Intel’s stock fell 60% last year. Fortunately, today more companies are focusing on basic capitalism — producing better products for less money. Ford recently announced it will no longer require employees to take LGBTQ advocacy group surveys. USA Today reports that Lowe’s will reduce its participation with the Human Rights Campaign to “narrow its focus to safe and affordable housing.” When I was co-host of “20/20,” I wondered what would happen when Disney bought ABC. Not much changed for a while. But a few years later, after repeatedly rejecting videos I proposed about problems with Obamacare, ABC fired me. Still later, I laughed as I watched Disney go full woke. The president of the entertainment content division said, “We have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories, and yet we don’t have enough leads.” Disney’s television animation producer added, “I was just, wherever I could, adding queerness.” But many such movies flopped. “The Marvels,” featuring a Muslim teen and black female sidekick, lost $237 million. “Lightyear,” featuring the first same-sex kiss in a Disney-Pixar movie, lost $106 million. “Elemental,” featuring a nonbinary character (a lake with earrings), didn’t even reach $30 million it’s opening week. Now Disney’s quietly scaling back. More companies have started to recognize a need to focus on their core business rather than virtue-signaling. “It’s the beginnings of an unwind,” says Cole, “that I think is going to be critical for us to achieve success.” I wonder why they were so dumb in the first place.

(NASDAQ: MGPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) Class Period: January 19, 2024 - September 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

On September 24, 2024, after market close, an investment research report emerged calling into question the integrity of SUI’s Board and the integrity of the Company’s governance, controls, and financial disclosures. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to SUI’s revelation. The price of SUI’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $139.10 per share on September 24, 2024, SUI’s stock price fell to a low of $137.48 per share on September 25, 2024. For more information on the Sun Communities class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SUI Cassava Sciences, Inc (NASDAQ: SAVA) Class Period: February 7, 2024 - November 24, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that defendants provided investors with material information concerning Cassava’s leading drug candidate, simufilam. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, clear confidence in simufilam’s ability to treat Alzheimer’s Disease. On November 25, 2024, Cassava released topline results for the first of its two ongoing Phase 3 studies on simufilam, the “ReThink-ALZ” study. The results indicated that simufilam failed to meet each of the pre-specified primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints; in sum, simufilam failed to outperform the placebo. Following this news, the price of Cassava’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $26.48 per share on November 22, 2024, Cassava’s stock price fell to $4.30 per share on November 25, 2024, a decline of about 83.76% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Cassava class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SAVA MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI) Class Period: May 4, 2023 - October 30, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 14, 2025 MGPI is a manufacturer of hard liquors such as tequila, bourbon, rye, whiskey, vodka, and gin. MGPI sells the spirits it produces under its own brands as well as to other alcohol distributors and brands. Prior to the Class Period, sales of hard liquors, such as those produced and sold by MGPI, increased dramatically in the wake of COVID-19. However, as quarantines ended, sales of hard liquors slowed across the alcoholic beverage industry, and a backlog of inventory began to increase. The Complaint alleges that during the Class Period, MGPI falsely assured investors that its projections and statements accounted for the industry slowdown and that it was well-positioned to avoid a buildup of inventory. The Company also claimed that its projected sales took these industry trends into account. MGPI announced on October 17, 2024, that a slowdown in demand and an excess in inventories would undermine sales. This revelation caused the Company’s stock to plummet 29.5%. Then, less than two weeks later, on October 31, 2024, Defendants revealed that its excess inventory would have an even greater impact than previously reported. This caused the Company’s stock to drop another 14.7%, to a close of $49.04 per share on October 31, 2024. In total, MGPI’s share price declined nearly 50% on these two disclosures, wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars in market capitalization and damaging investors.

Stock traded at ₹365.10 on the NSE, lower by 7.74%. As India anticipates the Union Budget 2025-26, several expectations have emerged that could significantly impact wealth management strategies. There is an expectation that the government may raise the basic exemption limit for personal income tax, with EY India suggesting an increase from ₹3 lakh to ₹5 lakh. This move could enhance disposable income and stimulate economic growth. Investors are also hopeful for a more streamlined capital gains tax structure across various asset classes, which could reduce complexity and improve compliance. Deloitte anticipates that the government may introduce measures to simplify the tax structure, potentially facilitating smoother merger and acquisition deals. On the investment front, the government is expected to maintain a strong focus on infrastructure development, with previous budgets allocating a capital expenditure outlay of 11.1 trillion rupees for this purpose. Similar or increased allocations are anticipated, continuing to drive growth in sectors like construction, cement, steel, and engineering. Furthermore, with the global shift towards sustainability, there is an expectation for increased emphasis on renewable energy and green technologies. Incentives for green bonds or Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investments may also be introduced, aligning with global sustainability goals. For wealth management, these changes could necessitate adjustments in investment strategies to maintain tax efficiency, especially with potential modifications in income and capital gains taxes. The anticipated increased government spending in infrastructure and green energy sectors could also make related investment avenues more lucrative. As regulatory changes, particularly concerning mutual funds and other investment vehicles, are likely, staying informed and consulting with financial advisors will be crucial for navigating these shifts effectively. In summary, the upcoming budget is expected to introduce measures that could influence various aspects of wealth management, from tax planning to investment strategies. “The upcoming budget holds the promise of propelling India’s economy to greater heights in FY2025. With an immense focus on “Make in India” initiatives, an increasing regulatory oversight in the financial sector and a thriving global capability hub as key themes, the budget could further address issues faced by foreign companies doing business in India, attract investments for MSME entities and address inflationary pressures. By focusing on export competitiveness, sustainable infrastructure, and inclusive growth measures, the budget has the potential to strengthen India’s economic resilience and position it as a leader in the global economic landscape” The board has approved enhancement and combination of the previously approved fund-raising limit by way of nonconvertible debentures (“NCDs”) from Rs. 5,000 crores to Rs. 11,000 crores, which are to be raised through public issue or private placement, or a mix thereof. It has also approved raising of funds for an amount not exceeding ₹5,000 crore via QIP. Shares traded at ₹523.55 on the NSE, higher by 5.30% WhatsApp Image 2025-01-27 at 15.02.34_a6c1e5bf.jpg The number of stocks that recorded a 52-week high was 51, and those that hit a 52-week low was 144. A total of 304 stocks traded in the upper circuit, and 257 in the lower circuit. “To empower Indian farmers and accelerate agricultural growth, we anticipate exempting essential agricultural inputs such as agrochemicals, drones, and modern implements from GST or reducing the rate to a maximum of 5%. The current 18% GST on these items discourages farmers from adopting advanced technologies vital for bridging the yield gap with developed nations. This high tax burden often forces farmers to rely on low-quality alternatives, leading to reduced productivity, lower incomes, and significant losses for the nation in terms of GDP and food security. Additionally, lowering the import duty on pesticide technicals and formulations continues to 10% making advanced innovative crop solutions more affordable and accessible. Encouraging domestic R&D through reinstating a 200% tax deduction on research expenses and allocating a dedicated budget for agrochemical innovation will foster self-reliance and reduce dependency on imports. We appreciate the various initiatives by the Hon’ble Agriculture Minister, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan, giving focus to the agriculture sector under the dynamic leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. India’s agricultural research needs urgent attention. Only 0.06% of GDP is allocated to R&D, compared to 4.5-5% in developed nations, limiting our capacity to innovate. Reinstating the 200% tax incentive for R&D would encourage domestic innovation, reduce dependence on foreign technology, and ensure farmers benefit from cutting-edge solutions. The agrochemical industry, contributing USD 5.5 billion annually to India’s agricultural exports, is pivotal to strengthening agriculture. Strategic measures like tax incentives, a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and a review of the Insecticides Act to streamline faster new product approvals will empower farmers, enhance productivity, and position India as a global leader in agriculture.” “As we approach the Union Budget for 2025, we anticipate a comprehensive and broad-based fiscal plan from the Modi government, marking its first full-fledged budget in this term. The government is expected to focus on continued infrastructure investment, particularly in critical areas such as housing, electricity, and employment generation. The targeted fiscal deficit is projected to be around 4.5% of GDP, reflecting the government’s commitment to maintaining macroeconomic stability amidst global uncertainties. While there may be discussions around potential relief for taxpayers, we do not anticipate any major changes in the overall tax structure in this budget. Instead, the focus will likely remain on enhancing capital expenditure and stimulating consumption to revitalize the economy, ultimately balancing support for growth initiatives with fiscal responsibility and setting a positive direction for India’s economy in the coming fiscal year.” “The Union Budget should focus on continuity in its policies—frequent changes can disrupt confidence and long-term planning. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain 98% of the existing framework and communicate to the world about the consistency maintained. In fact, the Budget should focus on improving internal governance—diverting resources towards more impactful initiatives and eliminating redundant schemes. Necessary changes should be made wherever required with supporting rationale. This will also create a business-friendly environment, which is essential for India to attain its goal of Viksit Bharat. Streamlined regulations and a robust single-window clearance system can remove obstacles form industries, helping them utilise their full potential and drive economic expansion. High-tech manufacturing sectors, especially space, semiconductors, and chips, must form the core of this approach. Expanding the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme beyond its current 14 sectors would further bolster India’s industrial base and enhance resilience against global disruptions. Agriculture is equally important and remains central to India’s economic fabric. Initiatives such as One District, One Warehouse, can minimise post-harvest losses and improve supply chain efficiency, resulting in an increase in farmer incomes. By rationalising GST, reforming labour laws and incentivising green technologies, India can address the burgeoning issue of climate change while fostering resilience. These interconnected efforts, backed by public-private collaboration, can transform India into a future-ready, globally competitive economy.” Shares up 2.76% on the NSE to trade at ₹1,400.05 Radico Khaitan reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹95.49 crore as against ₹75.15 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year Datamatics Global Services reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹74.61 crore as against ₹41.41 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Orient Electric board has approved the payment of interim dividend of Rs 0.75 per equity share and fixed Tuesday, February 04, 2025, as the record date. Company reported its net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹27.17 crore as against ₹24.33 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Reducing the LTCG tax on equities from 12.5% to 10% would leave an additional 2.5% of gains in investors’ hands as investable capital. This surplus capital is likely to be reinvested in the market, enhancing liquidity and deepening market penetration. Similarly, reintroducing indexation benefits for debt mutual funds would ensure that investors are taxed only on real gains, making long-term investments in debt markets more attractive. These changes align with global best practices and can create a virtuous cycle—encouraging more retail and institutional participation, strengthening capital markets, and driving sustainable long-term growth. A stronger push for the vehicle scrappage policy could be a game-changer. Enhancing scrappage incentives to 8–10% of a new vehicle’s price and providing stronger benefits for electric vehicle (EVs) adoption would modernize India’s automotive landscape. Expanding scrapping facilities and automating fitness tests would make the process seamless. More importantly, linking scrappage with EV adoption would accelerate India’s transition to cleaner mobility while generating jobs in manufacturing and recycling. These measures mirror global best practices, such as Germany’s Umweltprämie and China’s EV incentives. This move not only reduces pollution but also boosts GST revenues—making it a win-win for both the economy and the environment. Lowering the GST rate on health and life insurance premiums from 18% to 5% would significantly reduce costs, making it more affordable and accessible. A lower GST rate would encourage more people across income levels to invest in health and life coverage. While there may be an initial reduction in GST collections per policy, the long-term impact could be much more positive—higher insurance penetration would offset revenue losses, while also reducing the financial burden on public healthcare infrastructure aligning with the government’s broader objective of strengthening social safety nets. Targeted infrastructure investments in underserved areas, including rural housing under PMAY, health and wellness centres, and broadband expansion under BharatNet, would drive inclusive economic growth. Improved healthcare, digital access, and transport connectivity would uplift living standards, reduce poverty, and foster greater economic participation. For instance, extending housing and clean water access to marginalized communities would not only enhance quality of life but also stimulate local economies. Prioritizing such investments ensures equitable development, bridges regional disparities, and lays the foundation for sustainable growth, aligning with India’s broader economic and social objectives. Craftsman Automation’s consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 declined to ₹12.93 crore as against ₹81.47 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Deepak Fertilizers and Petrochemicals Corporation reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹253.09 crore as against ₹60.53 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Teamlease Services Limited reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹28.37 crore as against ₹31.12 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year.

CAMS stock gained 3.71% on the NSE to ₹3,858.55 Maruti Suzuki India’s consolidated net profit increased by 16 per cent to ₹3,727 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2024, as against ₹3,207 crore in the October-December period of last fiscal. Ambuja Cements (ACL), an Adani Group company, is expected to report a top-line in the range of ₹8,022 crore to ₹9,076 crore in the December quarter, according to estimates from top stock broking firms. While Yes Securities sees a 1.3 per cent year-on-year decline in ACL’s Q3FY25 revenue, Nuvama Institutional Equities estimates a jump of up to 12 per cent jump. Net profit is expected to be in the range of ₹74 crore to ₹1,022 crore, representing a decline of 6 per cent to 32 per cent in net profit. Read full report here “Indian agriculture needs to be supported by strong research for the development of resilient seeds for better adoption to climatic changes. Sustained budgetary focus on varietal development can provide farmers with better and more climate-resilient options. This can be a great support to farmers for increasing yield by 15-40% from limited land resources. Agri infrastructure is a critical factor in the development of the sector. Last year a budget of INR 600 cr was allocated to AIF for promoting the creation of infrastructure at the farm and organisation level. The scheme should be promoted further with a larger budget to support micro infrastructure development not only in Agriculture but also in allied sectors such as dairy, fisheries, floriculture, beekeeping and medicinal plants. Further, schemes to promote digital agriculture should be promoted in the upcoming budget to enable seedless connectivity and data flow from producers to consumers. Digital infrastructure, supported by tools such as blockchain and IoT, can help farmers make better, informed decisions, create preparedness for nature’s unpredictability, and manage price fluctuations in the market.” CSB Bank reported an overall good set of numbers for the quarter ended December 2024. Here’s what stood out: In Q3 FY25, the banking sector has been impacted by liquidity tightness in the system, having a say on growth in deposits and consequentially the growth in advances. The system level growth in deposits was seen at 9.8 per cent year on year and the growth in advances at 11.2 per cent. However, CSB Bank was an exception. It’s business (deposits and advances) grew at over twice the system level growth, unlike some bigger banks. Deposits grew at 22.2 per cent and advances at 26.5 per cent year on year.

But then the price started to moderate. On Tuesday (January 28), aluminium futures (February) closed at ₹247.35. Although the price has dropped, we cannot really call it a trend reversal. Especially considering that a retracement is usual after a sharp up move. Read full report here ‘’The world seems to be different in the last one week. DeepSeek has taken the world by storm over last couple of days – DeepSeek R1, dropped last week is already comparing with OPEN AI’s top models across math, code, and reasoning tasks and at fraction of costs!! The platform is open source, and the massive research is out there for anyone to threadbare! The way all the semi names have given up gains and corrected, difficult to say, that we are done yet there as uncertainty would continue to prevail over what the true demand would be for the chips, fabrication plants, energy, etc. There is likely to be some commentary from the Mega Cap names later this week – Apple, MSFT, TSLA, META, ASML, etc – hopefully, some clarity may emerge on what DeepSeek would eventually mean for Big Tech. INDIA during the week extended the sell off, with SMID indices draw down now approaching 15-18% - already the biggest drawdown since start of 2022. We would be favouring a sharp bounce here, given how oversold the momentum indicators are, but any sustained rally would require some direction from FM (Saturday Budget) and RBI (easing of lending norms, rate cut, etc). RBI has already initiated some announcements as regards unconventional easing – need to follow up with more of such announcements and rate cut perhaps in Feb. Liquidity Deficit has ballooned to INR 3.1trn, prompting RBI to announce slew of measures like: · OMO purchase of INR 600bn in 3 equal tranches · 6mth tenor USD/INR buy/sell swap of $5bn on Jan 31st · Longer tenor 56-day VRR of INR 500bn on Feb 7th to add durability to liquidity the measures announced could improve the system liquidity deficit to INR 2.4trn by end March, with core deficit likely around INR 1.0-1.2trn, implying that more measures are likely to be announced. Our economist suggests that these are unconventional easing mechanisms, and probably precursor to a likely monetary policy easing too in Feb !! Having lost around 3% of its value so far in the month, Nifty looks on track to end January on a negative note to mark the fourth consecutive month of correction — an exceptionally rare occurrence that hasn’t been reported in the last 23 years. Fed action, slew of reforms in the budget and liquidity easing by the central bank will set the tone for the markets in the coming 2-3 months. The FII’s have been sellers almost to the tune to ~ 1 bn USD even in Jan. Technically a push beyond 23200 will determine the future trend.’’ “The Budget announced in July 2024 brought limited changes for individual taxpayers, leaving many to hope that the upcoming Budget 2025 will deliver the much-needed tax relief to alleviate their financial pressures. There is a strong expectation that the government will focus on improving taxpayers’ savings by introducing reforms such as a unified tax regime and enhanced deductions. The Dilemma of Old vs New Tax Regimes - The introduction of two tax regimes - Old Tax Regime (OTR) and New Tax Regime (NTR) - was intended to offer taxpayers flexibility, allowing them to choose the system that best suits their investments, savings habits, and preferences. However, the reality has been far more complex. Many taxpayers find themselves confused between the two regimes, often reassessing their choice not only during the year but also while filing their tax returns. In light of these complexities, the upcoming Budget should focus on simplifying the tax structure for individual taxpayers by consolidating the current dual regimes into a single, cohesive tax framework. While this shift may take time, it is anticipated that the OTR may eventually be phased out, with its abolition ideally scheduled for FY 2026-27 to provide ample time for taxpayers, employers, and financial institutions to adjust. A Single, More Beneficial Tax Regime - Since the introduction of the NTR, the options for tax savings have been limited, making it essential to reconsider and amend the structure for the benefit of taxpayers. While the NTR is preferred as a streamlined tax system, it can be made even more effective by incorporating the following key changes: Simplification of income tax slabs and rates: Increasing the basic exemption limit of income from INR 3 lakhs to INR 5 lakhs. The differences between tax slabs are currently inconsistent at INR 2 lakhs or INR 3 lakhs. A more uniform approach is needed with consistent income gaps. Introducing a new 25% tax rate slab will provide further tax relief for middle-income earners. The tax rates currently stand at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%. The income limit for the 30% should be enhanced from INR 15 lakhs to INR 20 lakhs. Inclusion of popular deductions under the NTR: Section 80C: Allow deductions up to INR 2 lakhs for life insurance premiums, employees’ Provident Fund contributions, etc. Section 80D: Extend the deduction up to INR 1 lakh for health insurance premiums for self and family, addressing the growing burden of medical expenses. Section 80TTB: Include a deduction of up to INR 50,000 for senior citizens earning interest from deposits with banks, post offices, etc. 10(13A): Allow salaried taxpayers to claim HRA deductions for rental expenditure under the NTR. These proposed amendments will make the NTR not only simpler but also more tax-efficient” Indian Bank reported a standalone net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹2,852.36 crore as against ₹2,119.35 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Gujarat Fluorochemicals’ consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 stood at ₹126 crore as against ₹80 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year.

The platform enhancement introduces transparent pricing mechanisms and streamlined procurement processes for the LGD market inspiring confidence among key stakeholders. This strategic move is set to streamline the procurement for jewellers while establishing a transparent and efficient pricing mechanism for the rapidly growing LGD market in India. Mr. Ketan Kothari, Director of Augmont Group, said, “Augmont has firmly established itself as India’s go-to destination for buying and selling gold. Building on this strong foundation, we are proud to have our own lab-grown diamond (LGD) platform on Augmont SPOT, addressing the surging demand in this rapidly growing industry. The platform will enable market pricing and delivery of these diamonds globally including USA, Europe, Gulf and East Asia’’ Mr. Aarav Bafna, Product Head (LGD), Augmont, said, “With the extended version of SPOT, we plan to set a benchmark for LGD pricing. The current LGD pricing model, based solely on discounts relative to mined diamonds, is fundamentally flawed and irrational. Augmont is here to transform that narrative. Just as we revolutionized gold trading and price discovery in India, we are now ready to redefine and reimagine the LGD market.” SPOT offers a comprehensive and unified trading experience, enabling jewellers to source all their manufacturing requirements—including gold, silver, platinum, lab-grown diamonds, precious metal alloys, precious stones, and other essential materials—through a single integrated online platform. It also features real-time price discovery powered by advanced algorithms and market mechanisms, ensuring transparent and fair pricing. Quality assurance is a priority, with certification and verification processes for all listed diamonds. Built upon Augmont’s proven 17-year-old trading infrastructure, SPOT ensures seamless integration for a reliable and efficient trading experience. The platform addresses the growing demand for lab-grown diamonds, which have gained significant market share due to their sustainable nature and competitive pricing. SPOT is expected to handle substantial trading volumes, reflecting India’s dominant position in the global LGD polishing industry. As per the Commerce Ministry’s data, India polishes almost 98% of all lab-grown diamonds in the world in 2022. As per the EY report, the demand for Lab-Grown Diamonds is rising across the world, and its global market size is growing at 8.64% CAGR to touch $39.3 billion by 2028. And the Indian lab-grown diamond jewellery market, which was valued at around $300 million in 2023, is set to increase to $1.2 billion by 2033.

The government can play a pivotal role by introducing policy frameworks that encourage innovation -such as tax incentives, streamlined regulatory approvals, and interest subvention schemes to ease capital access for operators. Integrating flex spaces into urban development projects, like smart cities, IT parks and transport hubs, will further bolster growth and establish them as a vital component of India’s economic infrastructure. At the same time, the private sector must rise to the challenge by delivering world-class, technology driven workspace solutions that cater to the evolving needs of businesses and professionals. Investments in sustainable practices, digital infrastructure like 5G and enhanced customer experiences will ensure long term viability and competitiveness.

The mood is still downbeat among participants with Q3 results from India Inc so far either on expected lines or below market expectations. The focus has now shifted to two major events - FOMC meeting scheduled tomorrow and Union Budget 2025 on February 1. The unabated selling by foreign portfolio investors and the bloodbath in the mid and small-cap segments is a cause for concern, investors said. Read more “With inflation showing no signs of abating within the Reserve Bank of India’s target range in the near future, I believe the finance minister will implement necessary policy measures to curb price increases. This could involve reducing taxes on consumer goods such as packaged food and edible oils. This would boost household disposable income and positively impact private consumption. Furthermore, I believe the Budget should include measures to encourage savings through tax rationalisation and stimulate loan growth. A separate announcement on developing future-proof digital infrastructure for the financial sector in the era of artificial intelligence is also anticipated,” “Under the visionary leadership of Honourable Prime Minister Shri. Narendra Modi, the Government of India has achieved significant milestones in housing through the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). Expanding the programme to include 2 crore additional rural houses and 1 crore urban houses by FY 2024-29 highlights the government’s dedication to uplifting marginalised communities. Further policy interventions, such as enhanced subsidies for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS), can reduce financial barriers and improve access to quality housing. To advance the Government of India’s vision of ‘Housing for All,’ incorporating affordable housing for EWS under Schedule VII of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) provisions in The Companies Act will empower corporates entities and foundations to contribute to affordable housing initiatives. Encouraging public, private banks and financial institutions to prioritise affordable housing loans; introducing preferential interest rates and affordable repayment options (EMIs) for such loans will advance access to affordable housing. Additionally, blending CSR funds with government grants can address funding gaps. We advocate for a Public Private People Partnership (P4) model to foster effective collaboration among stakeholders. This will accelerate progress toward ‘Housing for All’ and support inclusive, sustainable development aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” “The current tax framework, while serving its purpose, could benefit from greater flexibility to better support middle-class taxpayers, especially in areas like home loan interest deductions and investments under Section 80C. The ₹2,00,000 cap on home loan interest deductions for self-occupied properties, set in 2019, has not kept pace with inflation and rising property prices. As a result, many middle-class taxpayers may find it challenging to fully benefit from this deduction. Similarly, the Section 80C limit of ₹1,50,000, which has remained unchanged for almost a decade, may not be sufficient for salaried individuals, especially given that a significant portion of this limit is often absorbed by provident fund contributions, leaving limited room for other investments. To further support taxpayers, it would be beneficial to consider increasing the home loan interest deduction and revising the Section 80C limit to better reflect current economic conditions. Additionally, expanding these enhanced deductions, particularly under section 80C, to the new tax regime under Section 115BAC would offer more inclusivity, allowing taxpayers to benefit from lower tax rates while still having the flexibility to optimize their financial planning. This would not only ease financial burdens but also encourage homeownership, increase savings, and contribute to overall economic growth.” “The Union Budget 2025 is anticipated to prioritise India’s transition to a sustainable energy future by boosting investments in renewable energy infrastructure, green financing, and emerging technologies like green hydrogen. Measures to ease financial barriers to rooftop solar adoption, strengthen the National Solar Portal, and incentivise battery energy storage systems are expected to drive growth. Enhanced support for electric mobility and sustainable aviation fuels could further align India with its Net-Zero ambitions. Additionally, expanded tax incentives for green debt securities and clear policies for carbon markets are likely to attract investments, driving progress towards achieving India’s renewable energy capacity target and Net Zero target”. “The Union Budget 2025 holds immense significance for India’s manufacturing sector as the country strives to achieve its $2 trillion export target by 2030. To enhance global competitiveness, we expect measures such as tariff rationalization, duty exemptions, and expanded remission schemes to lower production costs and boost exports. Simplifying compliance procedures is also crucial to streamline operations and attract greater foreign investments. Targeted incentives for high-value manufacturing sectors like electronics and precision machinery, alongside support for labour-intensive industries such as textiles, footwear, and food processing, can drive rural development and create widespread employment. Additionally, fostering innovation by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies such as AI, digital twins, and 3D printing will position India as a hub for advanced manufacturing. We hope the budget introduces a visionary roadmap that propels the sector toward sustainability, agility, and leadership in global supply chains, fuelling inclusive economic growth” “The transport and logistics industry needs continued support from the government. To support the transport and logistics industry, TDS exemptions should be reconsidered given the low-margin nature of the business (3-4%) and long payment cycles. While exemptions exist for owners with fewer than 10 vehicles, customers still deduct TDS fearing non-compliance. Faster depreciation for EV trucks is essential to encourage adoption, alongside fiscal benefits to develop EV fast-charging infrastructure on highways to address range anxiety and save drivers’ time. A comprehensive fiscal policy, in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, is needed to promote LNG trucks, ensuring cleaner logistics and lower costs. Additionally, the GST process must be more transparent and faceless for efficiency.” “India’s strength lies in its people and the country has opportunities for the youth. We expect that the government will continue to prioritize skill development and job creation to tap into India’s demographic advantage, which will drive economic growth and increase consumption through higher incomes. While the challenge of inflation, particularly food inflation continues to remain a concern, there is a need to implement robust supply-side measures to reduce the pain. We expect to see a focus on long-term solutions to strengthen the agricultural value chain and incentivize production. In the short term, direct benefit transfers (DBTs) may help support rural consumption. Infrastructure development will also remain a key priority, with continued investment in roads, multi-modal logistics parks, and overall logistics. Additionally, the government will emphasize healthcare, education, and skills development, while also promoting innovative technologies for inclusivity, formalization, and transparent governance. As India aims to become a Viksit Bharat by 2047, sustained investment in social, physical, and digital infrastructure will be crucial for future growth.” AAVAS, ADANIENT, ADANIPORTS, AJANTPHARM,

Stock traded at ₹365.10 on the NSE, lower by 7.74%. As India anticipates the Union Budget 2025-26, several expectations have emerged that could significantly impact wealth management strategies. There is an expectation that the government may raise the basic exemption limit for personal income tax, with EY India suggesting an increase from ₹3 lakh to ₹5 lakh. This move could enhance disposable income and stimulate economic growth. Investors are also hopeful for a more streamlined capital gains tax structure across various asset classes, which could reduce complexity and improve compliance. Deloitte anticipates that the government may introduce measures to simplify the tax structure, potentially facilitating smoother merger and acquisition deals. On the investment front, the government is expected to maintain a strong focus on infrastructure development, with previous budgets allocating a capital expenditure outlay of 11.1 trillion rupees for this purpose. Similar or increased allocations are anticipated, continuing to drive growth in sectors like construction, cement, steel, and engineering. Furthermore, with the global shift towards sustainability, there is an expectation for increased emphasis on renewable energy and green technologies. Incentives for green bonds or Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investments may also be introduced, aligning with global sustainability goals. For wealth management, these changes could necessitate adjustments in investment strategies to maintain tax efficiency, especially with potential modifications in income and capital gains taxes. The anticipated increased government spending in infrastructure and green energy sectors could also make related investment avenues more lucrative. As regulatory changes, particularly concerning mutual funds and other investment vehicles, are likely, staying informed and consulting with financial advisors will be crucial for navigating these shifts effectively. In summary, the upcoming budget is expected to introduce measures that could influence various aspects of wealth management, from tax planning to investment strategies. “The upcoming budget holds the promise of propelling India’s economy to greater heights in FY2025. With an immense focus on “Make in India” initiatives, an increasing regulatory oversight in the financial sector and a thriving global capability hub as key themes, the budget could further address issues faced by foreign companies doing business in India, attract investments for MSME entities and address inflationary pressures. By focusing on export competitiveness, sustainable infrastructure, and inclusive growth measures, the budget has the potential to strengthen India’s economic resilience and position it as a leader in the global economic landscape” The board has approved enhancement and combination of the previously approved fund-raising limit by way of nonconvertible debentures (“NCDs”) from Rs. 5,000 crores to Rs. 11,000 crores, which are to be raised through public issue or private placement, or a mix thereof. It has also approved raising of funds for an amount not exceeding ₹5,000 crore via QIP. Shares traded at ₹523.55 on the NSE, higher by 5.30% WhatsApp Image 2025-01-27 at 15.02.34_a6c1e5bf.jpg The number of stocks that recorded a 52-week high was 51, and those that hit a 52-week low was 144. A total of 304 stocks traded in the upper circuit, and 257 in the lower circuit. “To empower Indian farmers and accelerate agricultural growth, we anticipate exempting essential agricultural inputs such as agrochemicals, drones, and modern implements from GST or reducing the rate to a maximum of 5%. The current 18% GST on these items discourages farmers from adopting advanced technologies vital for bridging the yield gap with developed nations. This high tax burden often forces farmers to rely on low-quality alternatives, leading to reduced productivity, lower incomes, and significant losses for the nation in terms of GDP and food security. Additionally, lowering the import duty on pesticide technicals and formulations continues to 10% making advanced innovative crop solutions more affordable and accessible. Encouraging domestic R&D through reinstating a 200% tax deduction on research expenses and allocating a dedicated budget for agrochemical innovation will foster self-reliance and reduce dependency on imports. We appreciate the various initiatives by the Hon’ble Agriculture Minister, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan, giving focus to the agriculture sector under the dynamic leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. India’s agricultural research needs urgent attention. Only 0.06% of GDP is allocated to R&D, compared to 4.5-5% in developed nations, limiting our capacity to innovate. Reinstating the 200% tax incentive for R&D would encourage domestic innovation, reduce dependence on foreign technology, and ensure farmers benefit from cutting-edge solutions. The agrochemical industry, contributing USD 5.5 billion annually to India’s agricultural exports, is pivotal to strengthening agriculture. Strategic measures like tax incentives, a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and a review of the Insecticides Act to streamline faster new product approvals will empower farmers, enhance productivity, and position India as a global leader in agriculture.” “As we approach the Union Budget for 2025, we anticipate a comprehensive and broad-based fiscal plan from the Modi government, marking its first full-fledged budget in this term. The government is expected to focus on continued infrastructure investment, particularly in critical areas such as housing, electricity, and employment generation. The targeted fiscal deficit is projected to be around 4.5% of GDP, reflecting the government’s commitment to maintaining macroeconomic stability amidst global uncertainties. While there may be discussions around potential relief for taxpayers, we do not anticipate any major changes in the overall tax structure in this budget. Instead, the focus will likely remain on enhancing capital expenditure and stimulating consumption to revitalize the economy, ultimately balancing support for growth initiatives with fiscal responsibility and setting a positive direction for India’s economy in the coming fiscal year.” “The Union Budget should focus on continuity in its policies—frequent changes can disrupt confidence and long-term planning. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain 98% of the existing framework and communicate to the world about the consistency maintained. In fact, the Budget should focus on improving internal governance—diverting resources towards more impactful initiatives and eliminating redundant schemes. Necessary changes should be made wherever required with supporting rationale. This will also create a business-friendly environment, which is essential for India to attain its goal of Viksit Bharat. Streamlined regulations and a robust single-window clearance system can remove obstacles form industries, helping them utilise their full potential and drive economic expansion. High-tech manufacturing sectors, especially space, semiconductors, and chips, must form the core of this approach. Expanding the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme beyond its current 14 sectors would further bolster India’s industrial base and enhance resilience against global disruptions. Agriculture is equally important and remains central to India’s economic fabric. Initiatives such as One District, One Warehouse, can minimise post-harvest losses and improve supply chain efficiency, resulting in an increase in farmer incomes. By rationalising GST, reforming labour laws and incentivising green technologies, India can address the burgeoning issue of climate change while fostering resilience. These interconnected efforts, backed by public-private collaboration, can transform India into a future-ready, globally competitive economy.” Shares up 2.76% on the NSE to trade at ₹1,400.05 Radico Khaitan reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹95.49 crore as against ₹75.15 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year Datamatics Global Services reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹74.61 crore as against ₹41.41 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Orient Electric board has approved the payment of interim dividend of Rs 0.75 per equity share and fixed Tuesday, February 04, 2025, as the record date. Company reported its net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹27.17 crore as against ₹24.33 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Reducing the LTCG tax on equities from 12.5% to 10% would leave an additional 2.5% of gains in investors’ hands as investable capital. This surplus capital is likely to be reinvested in the market, enhancing liquidity and deepening market penetration. Similarly, reintroducing indexation benefits for debt mutual funds would ensure that investors are taxed only on real gains, making long-term investments in debt markets more attractive. These changes align with global best practices and can create a virtuous cycle—encouraging more retail and institutional participation, strengthening capital markets, and driving sustainable long-term growth. A stronger push for the vehicle scrappage policy could be a game-changer. Enhancing scrappage incentives to 8–10% of a new vehicle’s price and providing stronger benefits for electric vehicle (EVs) adoption would modernize India’s automotive landscape. Expanding scrapping facilities and automating fitness tests would make the process seamless. More importantly, linking scrappage with EV adoption would accelerate India’s transition to cleaner mobility while generating jobs in manufacturing and recycling. These measures mirror global best practices, such as Germany’s Umweltprämie and China’s EV incentives. This move not only reduces pollution but also boosts GST revenues—making it a win-win for both the economy and the environment. Lowering the GST rate on health and life insurance premiums from 18% to 5% would significantly reduce costs, making it more affordable and accessible. A lower GST rate would encourage more people across income levels to invest in health and life coverage. While there may be an initial reduction in GST collections per policy, the long-term impact could be much more positive—higher insurance penetration would offset revenue losses, while also reducing the financial burden on public healthcare infrastructure aligning with the government’s broader objective of strengthening social safety nets. Targeted infrastructure investments in underserved areas, including rural housing under PMAY, health and wellness centres, and broadband expansion under BharatNet, would drive inclusive economic growth. Improved healthcare, digital access, and transport connectivity would uplift living standards, reduce poverty, and foster greater economic participation. For instance, extending housing and clean water access to marginalized communities would not only enhance quality of life but also stimulate local economies. Prioritizing such investments ensures equitable development, bridges regional disparities, and lays the foundation for sustainable growth, aligning with India’s broader economic and social objectives. Craftsman Automation’s consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 declined to ₹12.93 crore as against ₹81.47 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Deepak Fertilizers and Petrochemicals Corporation reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹253.09 crore as against ₹60.53 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Teamlease Services Limited reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹28.37 crore as against ₹31.12 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹124.10 crore as against ₹88.53 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. CAMS stock gained 3.71% on the NSE to ₹3,858.55 Maruti Suzuki India’s consolidated net profit increased by 16 per cent to ₹3,727 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2024, as against ₹3,207 crore in the October-December period of last fiscal. Ambuja Cements (ACL), an Adani Group company, is expected to report a top-line in the range of ₹8,022 crore to ₹9,076 crore in the December quarter, according to estimates from top stock broking firms. While Yes Securities sees a 1.3 per cent year-on-year decline in ACL’s Q3FY25 revenue, Nuvama Institutional Equities estimates a jump of up to 12 per cent jump. Net profit is expected to be in the range of ₹74 crore to ₹1,022 crore, representing a decline of 6 per cent to 32 per cent in net profit. Read full report here “Indian agriculture needs to be supported by strong research for the development of resilient seeds for better adoption to climatic changes. Sustained budgetary focus on varietal development can provide farmers with better and more climate-resilient options. This can be a great support to farmers for increasing yield by 15-40% from limited land resources. Agri infrastructure is a critical factor in the development of the sector. Last year a budget of INR 600 cr was allocated to AIF for promoting the creation of infrastructure at the farm and organisation level. The scheme should be promoted further with a larger budget to support micro infrastructure development not only in Agriculture but also in allied sectors such as dairy, fisheries, floriculture, beekeeping and medicinal plants. Further, schemes to promote digital agriculture should be promoted in the upcoming budget to enable seedless connectivity and data flow from producers to consumers. Digital infrastructure, supported by tools such as blockchain and IoT, can help farmers make better, informed decisions, create preparedness for nature’s unpredictability, and manage price fluctuations in the market.” CSB Bank reported an overall good set of numbers for the quarter ended December 2024. Here’s what stood out: In Q3 FY25, the banking sector has been impacted by liquidity tightness in the system, having a say on growth in deposits and consequentially the growth in advances. The system level growth in deposits was seen at 9.8 per cent year on year and the growth in advances at 11.2 per cent. However, CSB Bank was an exception. It’s business (deposits and advances) grew at over twice the system level growth, unlike some bigger banks. Deposits grew at 22.2 per cent and advances at 26.5 per cent year on year. Read full report here Aluminium futures broke out of a range and marked a 11-quarter high last week. The continuous contract marked a high of ₹256.45 on January 20. But then the price started to moderate. On Tuesday (January 28), aluminium futures (February) closed at ₹247.35. Although the price has dropped, we cannot really call it a trend reversal. Especially considering that a retracement is usual after a sharp up move. Read full report here ‘’The world seems to be different in the last one week. DeepSeek has taken the world by storm over last couple of days – DeepSeek R1, dropped last week is already comparing with OPEN AI’s top models across math, code, and reasoning tasks and at fraction of costs!! The platform is open source, and the massive research is out there for anyone to threadbare! The way all the semi names have given up gains and corrected, difficult to say, that we are done yet there as uncertainty would continue to prevail over what the true demand would be for the chips, fabrication plants, energy, etc. There is likely to be some commentary from the Mega Cap names later this week – Apple, MSFT, TSLA, META, ASML, etc – hopefully, some clarity may emerge on what DeepSeek would eventually mean for Big Tech. INDIA during the week extended the sell off, with SMID indices draw down now approaching 15-18% - already the biggest drawdown since start of 2022. We would be favouring a sharp bounce here, given how oversold the momentum indicators are, but any sustained rally would require some direction from FM (Saturday Budget) and RBI (easing of lending norms, rate cut, etc). RBI has already initiated some announcements as regards unconventional easing – need to follow up with more of such announcements and rate cut perhaps in Feb. Liquidity Deficit has ballooned to INR 3.1trn, prompting RBI to announce slew of measures like: · OMO purchase of INR 600bn in 3 equal tranches · 6mth tenor USD/INR buy/sell swap of $5bn on Jan 31st · Longer tenor 56-day VRR of INR 500bn on Feb 7th to add durability to liquidity the measures announced could improve the system liquidity deficit to INR 2.4trn by end March, with core deficit likely around INR 1.0-1.2trn, implying that more measures are likely to be announced. Our economist suggests that these are unconventional easing mechanisms, and probably precursor to a likely monetary policy easing too in Feb !! Having lost around 3% of its value so far in the month, Nifty looks on track to end January on a negative note to mark the fourth consecutive month of correction — an exceptionally rare occurrence that hasn’t been reported in the last 23 years. Fed action, slew of reforms in the budget and liquidity easing by the central bank will set the tone for the markets in the coming 2-3 months. The FII’s have been sellers almost to the tune to ~ 1 bn USD even in Jan. Technically a push beyond 23200 will determine the future trend.’’ “The Budget announced in July 2024 brought limited changes for individual taxpayers, leaving many to hope that the upcoming Budget 2025 will deliver the much-needed tax relief to alleviate their financial pressures. There is a strong expectation that the government will focus on improving taxpayers’ savings by introducing reforms such as a unified tax regime and enhanced deductions. The Dilemma of Old vs New Tax Regimes - The introduction of two tax regimes - Old Tax Regime (OTR) and New Tax Regime (NTR) - was intended to offer taxpayers flexibility, allowing them to choose the system that best suits their investments, savings habits, and preferences. However, the reality has been far more complex. Many taxpayers find themselves confused between the two regimes, often reassessing their choice not only during the year but also while filing their tax returns. In light of these complexities, the upcoming Budget should focus on simplifying the tax structure for individual taxpayers by consolidating the current dual regimes into a single, cohesive tax framework. While this shift may take time, it is anticipated that the OTR may eventually be phased out, with its abolition ideally scheduled for FY 2026-27 to provide ample time for taxpayers, employers, and financial institutions to adjust. A Single, More Beneficial Tax Regime - Since the introduction of the NTR, the options for tax savings have been limited, making it essential to reconsider and amend the structure for the benefit of taxpayers. While the NTR is preferred as a streamlined tax system, it can be made even more effective by incorporating the following key changes: Simplification of income tax slabs and rates: Increasing the basic exemption limit of income from INR 3 lakhs to INR 5 lakhs. The differences between tax slabs are currently inconsistent at INR 2 lakhs or INR 3 lakhs. A more uniform approach is needed with consistent income gaps. Introducing a new 25% tax rate slab will provide further tax relief for middle-income earners. The tax rates currently stand at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%. The income limit for the 30% should be enhanced from INR 15 lakhs to INR 20 lakhs. Inclusion of popular deductions under the NTR: Section 80C: Allow deductions up to INR 2 lakhs for life insurance premiums, employees’ Provident Fund contributions, etc. Section 80D: Extend the deduction up to INR 1 lakh for health insurance premiums for self and family, addressing the growing burden of medical expenses. Section 80TTB: Include a deduction of up to INR 50,000 for senior citizens earning interest from deposits with banks, post offices, etc. 10(13A): Allow salaried taxpayers to claim HRA deductions for rental expenditure under the NTR. These proposed amendments will make the NTR not only simpler but also more tax-efficient” Indian Bank reported a standalone net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹2,852.36 crore as against ₹2,119.35 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Gujarat Fluorochemicals’ consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 stood at ₹126 crore as against ₹80 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year.

Augmont, India’s largest gold trading platform, announced that it has added Lab Grown Diamonds (LGD) to its existing online SPOT trading platform for precious metals catering to more than 5,000 jewellers across the country. The enhanced SPOT 2.0 platform brings Augmont’s 17 years of precious metals trading expertise to the growing LGD sector. This addition represents an evolution of diamond trading infrastructure, particularly as India maintains its position as the world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing destination. The platform enhancement introduces transparent pricing mechanisms and streamlined procurement processes for the LGD market inspiring confidence among key stakeholders. This strategic move is set to streamline the procurement for jewellers while establishing a transparent and efficient pricing mechanism for the rapidly growing LGD market in India. Mr. Ketan Kothari, Director of Augmont Group, said, “Augmont has firmly established itself as India’s go-to destination for buying and selling gold. Building on this strong foundation, we are proud to have our own lab-grown diamond (LGD) platform on Augmont SPOT, addressing the surging demand in this rapidly growing industry. The platform will enable market pricing and delivery of these diamonds globally including USA, Europe, Gulf and East Asia’’ Mr. Aarav Bafna, Product Head (LGD), Augmont, said, “With the extended version of SPOT, we plan to set a benchmark for LGD pricing. The current LGD pricing model, based solely on discounts relative to mined diamonds, is fundamentally flawed and irrational. Augmont is here to transform that narrative. Just as we revolutionized gold trading and price discovery in India, we are now ready to redefine and reimagine the LGD market.” SPOT offers a comprehensive and unified trading experience, enabling jewellers to source all their manufacturing requirements—including gold, silver, platinum, lab-grown diamonds, precious metal alloys, precious stones, and other essential materials—through a single integrated online platform. It also features real-time price discovery powered by advanced algorithms and market mechanisms, ensuring transparent and fair pricing. Quality assurance is a priority, with certification and verification processes for all listed diamonds. Built upon Augmont’s proven 17-year-old trading infrastructure, SPOT ensures seamless integration for a reliable and efficient trading experience. The platform addresses the growing demand for lab-grown diamonds, which have gained significant market share due to their sustainable nature and competitive pricing. SPOT is expected to handle substantial trading volumes, reflecting India’s dominant position in the global LGD polishing industry. As per the Commerce Ministry’s data, India polishes almost 98% of all lab-grown diamonds in the world in 2022. As per the EY report, the demand for Lab-Grown Diamonds is rising across the world, and its global market size is growing at 8.64% CAGR to touch $39.3 billion by 2028. And the Indian lab-grown diamond jewellery market, which was valued at around $300 million in 2023, is set to increase to $1.2 billion by 2033.

The government can play a pivotal role by introducing policy frameworks that encourage innovation -such as tax incentives, streamlined regulatory approvals, and interest subvention schemes to ease capital access for operators. Integrating flex spaces into urban development projects, like smart cities, IT parks and transport hubs, will further bolster growth and establish them as a vital component of India’s economic infrastructure. At the same time, the private sector must rise to the challenge by delivering world-class, technology driven workspace solutions that cater to the evolving needs of businesses and professionals. Investments in sustainable practices, digital infrastructure like 5G and enhanced customer experiences will ensure long term viability and competitiveness.

The mood is still downbeat among participants with Q3 results from India Inc so far either on expected lines or below market expectations. The focus has now shifted to two major events - FOMC meeting scheduled tomorrow and Union Budget 2025 on February 1. The unabated selling by foreign portfolio investors and the bloodbath in the mid and small-cap segments is a cause for concern, investors said. Read more “With inflation showing no signs of abating within the Reserve Bank of India’s target range in the near future, I believe the finance minister will implement necessary policy measures to curb price increases. This could involve reducing taxes on consumer goods such as packaged food and edible oils. This would boost household disposable income and positively impact private consumption. Furthermore, I believe the Budget should include measures to encourage savings through tax rationalisation and stimulate loan growth. A separate announcement on developing future-proof digital infrastructure for the financial sector in the era of artificial intelligence is also anticipated,” “Under the visionary leadership of Honourable Prime Minister Shri. Narendra Modi, the Government of India has achieved significant milestones in housing through the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). Expanding the programme to include 2 crore additional rural houses and 1 crore urban houses by FY 2024-29 highlights the government’s dedication to uplifting marginalised communities. Further policy interventions, such as enhanced subsidies for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS), can reduce financial barriers and improve access to quality housing. To advance the Government of India’s vision of ‘Housing for All,’ incorporating affordable housing for EWS under Schedule VII of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) provisions in The Companies Act will empower corporates entities and foundations to contribute to affordable housing initiatives. Encouraging public, private banks and financial institutions to prioritise affordable housing loans; introducing preferential interest rates and affordable repayment options (EMIs) for such loans will advance access to affordable housing. Additionally, blending CSR funds with government grants can address funding gaps. We advocate for a Public Private People Partnership (P4) model to foster effective collaboration among stakeholders. This will accelerate progress toward ‘Housing for All’ and support inclusive, sustainable development aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” “The current tax framework, while serving its purpose, could benefit from greater flexibility to better support middle-class taxpayers, especially in areas like home loan interest deductions and investments under Section 80C. The ₹2,00,000 cap on home loan interest deductions for self-occupied properties, set in 2019, has not kept pace with inflation and rising property prices. As a result, many middle-class taxpayers may find it challenging to fully benefit from this deduction. Similarly, the Section 80C limit of ₹1,50,000, which has remained unchanged for almost a decade, may not be sufficient for salaried individuals, especially given that a significant portion of this limit is often absorbed by provident fund contributions, leaving limited room for other investments. To further support taxpayers, it would be beneficial to consider increasing the home loan interest deduction and revising the Section 80C limit to better reflect current economic conditions. Additionally, expanding these enhanced deductions, particularly under section 80C, to the new tax regime under Section 115BAC would offer more inclusivity, allowing taxpayers to benefit from lower tax rates while still having the flexibility to optimize their financial planning. This would not only ease financial burdens but also encourage homeownership, increase savings, and contribute to overall economic growth.” “The Union Budget 2025 is anticipated to prioritise India’s transition to a sustainable energy future by boosting investments in renewable energy infrastructure, green financing, and emerging technologies like green hydrogen. Measures to ease financial barriers to rooftop solar adoption, strengthen the National Solar Portal, and incentivise battery energy storage systems are expected to drive growth. Enhanced support for electric mobility and sustainable aviation fuels could further align India with its Net-Zero ambitions. Additionally, expanded tax incentives for green debt securities and clear policies for carbon markets are likely to attract investments, driving progress towards achieving India’s renewable energy capacity target and Net Zero target”. “The Union Budget 2025 holds immense significance for India’s manufacturing sector as the country strives to achieve its $2 trillion export target by 2030. To enhance global competitiveness, we expect measures such as tariff rationalization, duty exemptions, and expanded remission schemes to lower production costs and boost exports. Simplifying compliance procedures is also crucial to streamline operations and attract greater foreign investments. Targeted incentives for high-value manufacturing sectors like electronics and precision machinery, alongside support for labour-intensive industries such as textiles, footwear, and food processing, can drive rural development and create widespread employment. Additionally, fostering innovation by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies such as AI, digital twins, and 3D printing will position India as a hub for advanced manufacturing. We hope the budget introduces a visionary roadmap that propels the sector toward sustainability, agility, and leadership in global supply chains, fuelling inclusive economic growth” “The transport and logistics industry needs continued support from the government. To support the transport and logistics industry, TDS exemptions should be reconsidered given the low-margin nature of the business (3-4%) and long payment cycles. While exemptions exist for owners with fewer than 10 vehicles, customers still deduct TDS fearing non-compliance. Faster depreciation for EV trucks is essential to encourage adoption, alongside fiscal benefits to develop EV fast-charging infrastructure on highways to address range anxiety and save drivers’ time. A comprehensive fiscal policy, in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, is needed to promote LNG trucks, ensuring cleaner logistics and lower costs. Additionally, the GST process must be more transparent and faceless for efficiency.” “India’s strength lies in its people and the country has opportunities for the youth. We expect that the government will continue to prioritize skill development and job creation to tap into India’s demographic advantage, which will drive economic growth and increase consumption through higher incomes. While the challenge of inflation, particularly food inflation continues to remain a concern, there is a need to implement robust supply-side measures to reduce the pain. We expect to see a focus on long-term solutions to strengthen the agricultural value chain and incentivize production. In the short term, direct benefit transfers (DBTs) may help support rural consumption. Infrastructure development will also remain a key priority, with continued investment in roads, multi-modal logistics parks, and overall logistics. Additionally, the government will emphasize healthcare, education, and skills development, while also promoting innovative technologies for inclusivity, formalization, and transparent governance. As India aims to become a Viksit Bharat by 2047, sustained investment in social, physical, and digital infrastructure will be crucial for future growth.” AAVAS, ADANIENT, ADANIPORTS, AJANTPHARM,

Stock traded at ₹365.10 on the NSE, lower by 7.74%. As India anticipates the Union Budget 2025-26, several expectations have emerged that could significantly impact wealth management strategies. There is an expectation that the government may raise the basic exemption limit for personal income tax, with EY India suggesting an increase from ₹3 lakh to ₹5 lakh. This move could enhance disposable income and stimulate economic growth. Investors are also hopeful for a more streamlined capital gains tax structure across various asset classes, which could reduce complexity and improve compliance. Deloitte anticipates that the government may introduce measures to simplify the tax structure, potentially facilitating smoother merger and acquisition deals. On the investment front, the government is expected to maintain a strong focus on infrastructure development, with previous budgets allocating a capital expenditure outlay of 11.1 trillion rupees for this purpose. Similar or increased allocations are anticipated, continuing to drive growth in sectors like construction, cement, steel, and engineering. Furthermore, with the global shift towards sustainability, there is an expectation for increased emphasis on renewable energy and green technologies. Incentives for green bonds or Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investments may also be introduced, aligning with global sustainability goals. For wealth management, these changes could necessitate adjustments in investment strategies to maintain tax efficiency, especially with potential modifications in income and capital gains taxes. The anticipated increased government spending in infrastructure and green energy sectors could also make related investment avenues more lucrative. As regulatory changes, particularly concerning mutual funds and other investment vehicles, are likely, staying informed and consulting with financial advisors will be crucial for navigating these shifts effectively. In summary, the upcoming budget is expected to introduce measures that could influence various aspects of wealth management, from tax planning to investment strategies. “The upcoming budget holds the promise of propelling India’s economy to greater heights in FY2025. With an immense focus on “Make in India” initiatives, an increasing regulatory oversight in the financial sector and a thriving global capability hub as key themes, the budget could further address issues faced by foreign companies doing business in India, attract investments for MSME entities and address inflationary pressures. By focusing on export competitiveness, sustainable infrastructure, and inclusive growth measures, the budget has the potential to strengthen India’s economic resilience and position it as a leader in the global economic landscape” The board has approved enhancement and combination of the previously approved fund-raising limit by way of nonconvertible debentures (“NCDs”) from Rs. 5,000 crores to Rs. 11,000 crores, which are to be raised through public issue or private placement, or a mix thereof. It has also approved raising of funds for an amount not exceeding ₹5,000 crore via QIP. Shares traded at ₹523.55 on the NSE, higher by 5.30% WhatsApp Image 2025-01-27 at 15.02.34_a6c1e5bf.jpg The number of stocks that recorded a 52-week high was 51, and those that hit a 52-week low was 144. A total of 304 stocks traded in the upper circuit, and 257 in the lower circuit. “To empower Indian farmers and accelerate agricultural growth, we anticipate exempting essential agricultural inputs such as agrochemicals, drones, and modern implements from GST or reducing the rate to a maximum of 5%. The current 18% GST on these items discourages farmers from adopting advanced technologies vital for bridging the yield gap with developed nations. This high tax burden often forces farmers to rely on low-quality alternatives, leading to reduced productivity, lower incomes, and significant losses for the nation in terms of GDP and food security. Additionally, lowering the import duty on pesticide technicals and formulations continues to 10% making advanced innovative crop solutions more affordable and accessible. Encouraging domestic R&D through reinstating a 200% tax deduction on research expenses and allocating a dedicated budget for agrochemical innovation will foster self-reliance and reduce dependency on imports. We appreciate the various initiatives by the Hon’ble Agriculture Minister, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan, giving focus to the agriculture sector under the dynamic leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. India’s agricultural research needs urgent attention. Only 0.06% of GDP is allocated to R&D, compared to 4.5-5% in developed nations, limiting our capacity to innovate. Reinstating the 200% tax incentive for R&D would encourage domestic innovation, reduce dependence on foreign technology, and ensure farmers benefit from cutting-edge solutions. The agrochemical industry, contributing USD 5.5 billion annually to India’s agricultural exports, is pivotal to strengthening agriculture. Strategic measures like tax incentives, a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and a review of the Insecticides Act to streamline faster new product approvals will empower farmers, enhance productivity, and position India as a global leader in agriculture.” “As we approach the Union Budget for 2025, we anticipate a comprehensive and broad-based fiscal plan from the Modi government, marking its first full-fledged budget in this term. The government is expected to focus on continued infrastructure investment, particularly in critical areas such as housing, electricity, and employment generation. The targeted fiscal deficit is projected to be around 4.5% of GDP, reflecting the government’s commitment to maintaining macroeconomic stability amidst global uncertainties. While there may be discussions around potential relief for taxpayers, we do not anticipate any major changes in the overall tax structure in this budget. Instead, the focus will likely remain on enhancing capital expenditure and stimulating consumption to revitalize the economy, ultimately balancing support for growth initiatives with fiscal responsibility and setting a positive direction for India’s economy in the coming fiscal year.” “The Union Budget should focus on continuity in its policies—frequent changes can disrupt confidence and long-term planning. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain 98% of the existing framework and communicate to the world about the consistency maintained. In fact, the Budget should focus on improving internal governance—diverting resources towards more impactful initiatives and eliminating redundant schemes. Necessary changes should be made wherever required with supporting rationale. This will also create a business-friendly environment, which is essential for India to attain its goal of Viksit Bharat. Streamlined regulations and a robust single-window clearance system can remove obstacles form industries, helping them utilise their full potential and drive economic expansion. High-tech manufacturing sectors, especially space, semiconductors, and chips, must form the core of this approach. Expanding the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme beyond its current 14 sectors would further bolster India’s industrial base and enhance resilience against global disruptions. Agriculture is equally important and remains central to India’s economic fabric. Initiatives such as One District, One Warehouse, can minimise post-harvest losses and improve supply chain efficiency, resulting in an increase in farmer incomes. By rationalising GST, reforming labour laws and incentivising green technologies, India can address the burgeoning issue of climate change while fostering resilience. These interconnected efforts, backed by public-private collaboration, can transform India into a future-ready, globally competitive economy.” Shares up 2.76% on the NSE to trade at ₹1,400.05 Radico Khaitan reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹95.49 crore as against ₹75.15 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year Datamatics Global Services reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹74.61 crore as against ₹41.41 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Orient Electric board has approved the payment of interim dividend of Rs 0.75 per equity share and fixed Tuesday, February 04, 2025, as the record date. Company reported its net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹27.17 crore as against ₹24.33 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Reducing the LTCG tax on equities from 12.5% to 10% would leave an additional 2.5% of gains in investors’ hands as investable capital. This surplus capital is likely to be reinvested in the market, enhancing liquidity and deepening market penetration. Similarly, reintroducing indexation benefits for debt mutual funds would ensure that investors are taxed only on real gains, making long-term investments in debt markets more attractive. These changes align with global best practices and can create a virtuous cycle—encouraging more retail and institutional participation, strengthening capital markets, and driving sustainable long-term growth. A stronger push for the vehicle scrappage policy could be a game-changer. Enhancing scrappage incentives to 8–10% of a new vehicle’s price and providing stronger benefits for electric vehicle (EVs) adoption would modernize India’s automotive landscape. Expanding scrapping facilities and automating fitness tests would make the process seamless. More importantly, linking scrappage with EV adoption would accelerate India’s transition to cleaner mobility while generating jobs in manufacturing and recycling. These measures mirror global best practices, such as Germany’s Umweltprämie and China’s EV incentives. This move not only reduces pollution but also boosts GST revenues—making it a win-win for both the economy and the environment. Lowering the GST rate on health and life insurance premiums from 18% to 5% would significantly reduce costs, making it more affordable and accessible. A lower GST rate would encourage more people across income levels to invest in health and life coverage. While there may be an initial reduction in GST collections per policy, the long-term impact could be much more positive—higher insurance penetration would offset revenue losses, while also reducing the financial burden on public healthcare infrastructure aligning with the government’s broader objective of strengthening social safety nets. Targeted infrastructure investments in underserved areas, including rural housing under PMAY, health and wellness centres, and broadband expansion under BharatNet, would drive inclusive economic growth. Improved healthcare, digital access, and transport connectivity would uplift living standards, reduce poverty, and foster greater economic participation. For instance, extending housing and clean water access to marginalized communities would not only enhance quality of life but also stimulate local economies. Prioritizing such investments ensures equitable development, bridges regional disparities, and lays the foundation for sustainable growth, aligning with India’s broader economic and social objectives. Craftsman Automation’s consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 declined to ₹12.93 crore as against ₹81.47 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Deepak Fertilizers and Petrochemicals Corporation reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹253.09 crore as against ₹60.53 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Teamlease Services Limited reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹28.37 crore as against ₹31.12 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹124.10 crore as against ₹88.53 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. CAMS stock gained 3.71% on the NSE to ₹3,858.55 Maruti Suzuki India’s consolidated net profit increased by 16 per cent to ₹3,727 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2024, as against ₹3,207 crore in the October-December period of last fiscal. Ambuja Cements (ACL), an Adani Group company, is expected to report a top-line in the range of ₹8,022 crore to ₹9,076 crore in the December quarter, according to estimates from top stock broking firms. While Yes Securities sees a 1.3 per cent year-on-year decline in ACL’s Q3FY25 revenue, Nuvama Institutional Equities estimates a jump of up to 12 per cent jump. Net profit is expected to be in the range of ₹74 crore to ₹1,022 crore, representing a decline of 6 per cent to 32 per cent in net profit. Read full report here “Indian agriculture needs to be supported by strong research for the development of resilient seeds for better adoption to climatic changes. Sustained budgetary focus on varietal development can provide farmers with better and more climate-resilient options. This can be a great support to farmers for increasing yield by 15-40% from limited land resources. Agri infrastructure is a critical factor in the development of the sector. Last year a budget of INR 600 cr was allocated to AIF for promoting the creation of infrastructure at the farm and organisation level. The scheme should be promoted further with a larger budget to support micro infrastructure development not only in Agriculture but also in allied sectors such as dairy, fisheries, floriculture, beekeeping and medicinal plants. Further, schemes to promote digital agriculture should be promoted in the upcoming budget to enable seedless connectivity and data flow from producers to consumers. Digital infrastructure, supported by tools such as blockchain and IoT, can help farmers make better, informed decisions, create preparedness for nature’s unpredictability, and manage price fluctuations in the market.” CSB Bank reported an overall good set of numbers for the quarter ended December 2024. Here’s what stood out: In Q3 FY25, the banking sector has been impacted by liquidity tightness in the system, having a say on growth in deposits and consequentially the growth in advances. The system level growth in deposits was seen at 9.8 per cent year on year and the growth in advances at 11.2 per cent. However, CSB Bank was an exception. It’s business (deposits and advances) grew at over twice the system level growth, unlike some bigger banks. Deposits grew at 22.2 per cent and advances at 26.5 per cent year on year. Read full report here Aluminium futures broke out of a range and marked a 11-quarter high last week. The continuous contract marked a high of ₹256.45 on January 20. But then the price started to moderate. On Tuesday (January 28), aluminium futures (February) closed at ₹247.35. Although the price has dropped, we cannot really call it a trend reversal. Especially considering that a retracement is usual after a sharp up move. Read full report here ‘’The world seems to be different in the last one week. DeepSeek has taken the world by storm over last couple of days – DeepSeek R1, dropped last week is already comparing with OPEN AI’s top models across math, code, and reasoning tasks and at fraction of costs!! The platform is open source, and the massive research is out there for anyone to threadbare! The way all the semi names have given up gains and corrected, difficult to say, that we are done yet there as uncertainty would continue to prevail over what the true demand would be for the chips, fabrication plants, energy, etc. There is likely to be some commentary from the Mega Cap names later this week – Apple, MSFT, TSLA, META, ASML, etc – hopefully, some clarity may emerge on what DeepSeek would eventually mean for Big Tech. INDIA during the week extended the sell off, with SMID indices draw down now approaching 15-18% - already the biggest drawdown since start of 2022. We would be favouring a sharp bounce here, given how oversold the momentum indicators are, but any sustained rally would require some direction from FM (Saturday Budget) and RBI (easing of lending norms, rate cut, etc). RBI has already initiated some announcements as regards unconventional easing – need to follow up with more of such announcements and rate cut perhaps in Feb. Liquidity Deficit has ballooned to INR 3.1trn, prompting RBI to announce slew of measures like: · OMO purchase of INR 600bn in 3 equal tranches · 6mth tenor USD/INR buy/sell swap of $5bn on Jan 31st · Longer tenor 56-day VRR of INR 500bn on Feb 7th to add durability to liquidity the measures announced could improve the system liquidity deficit to INR 2.4trn by end March, with core deficit likely around INR 1.0-1.2trn, implying that more measures are likely to be announced. Our economist suggests that these are unconventional easing mechanisms, and probably precursor to a likely monetary policy easing too in Feb !! Having lost around 3% of its value so far in the month, Nifty looks on track to end January on a negative note to mark the fourth consecutive month of correction — an exceptionally rare occurrence that hasn’t been reported in the last 23 years. Fed action, slew of reforms in the budget and liquidity easing by the central bank will set the tone for the markets in the coming 2-3 months. The FII’s have been sellers almost to the tune to ~ 1 bn USD even in Jan. Technically a push beyond 23200 will determine the future trend.’’ “The Budget announced in July 2024 brought limited changes for individual taxpayers, leaving many to hope that the upcoming Budget 2025 will deliver the much-needed tax relief to alleviate their financial pressures. There is a strong expectation that the government will focus on improving taxpayers’ savings by introducing reforms such as a unified tax regime and enhanced deductions. The Dilemma of Old vs New Tax Regimes - The introduction of two tax regimes - Old Tax Regime (OTR) and New Tax Regime (NTR) - was intended to offer taxpayers flexibility, allowing them to choose the system that best suits their investments, savings habits, and preferences. However, the reality has been far more complex. Many taxpayers find themselves confused between the two regimes, often reassessing their choice not only during the year but also while filing their tax returns. In light of these complexities, the upcoming Budget should focus on simplifying the tax structure for individual taxpayers by consolidating the current dual regimes into a single, cohesive tax framework. While this shift may take time, it is anticipated that the OTR may eventually be phased out, with its abolition ideally scheduled for FY 2026-27 to provide ample time for taxpayers, employers, and financial institutions to adjust. A Single, More Beneficial Tax Regime - Since the introduction of the NTR, the options for tax savings have been limited, making it essential to reconsider and amend the structure for the benefit of taxpayers. While the NTR is preferred as a streamlined tax system, it can be made even more effective by incorporating the following key changes: Simplification of income tax slabs and rates: Increasing the basic exemption limit of income from INR 3 lakhs to INR 5 lakhs. The differences between tax slabs are currently inconsistent at INR 2 lakhs or INR 3 lakhs. A more uniform approach is needed with consistent income gaps. Introducing a new 25% tax rate slab will provide further tax relief for middle-income earners. The tax rates currently stand at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%. The income limit for the 30% should be enhanced from INR 15 lakhs to INR 20 lakhs. Inclusion of popular deductions under the NTR: Section 80C: Allow deductions up to INR 2 lakhs for life insurance premiums, employees’ Provident Fund contributions, etc. Section 80D: Extend the deduction up to INR 1 lakh for health insurance premiums for self and family, addressing the growing burden of medical expenses. Section 80TTB: Include a deduction of up to INR 50,000 for senior citizens earning interest from deposits with banks, post offices, etc. 10(13A): Allow salaried taxpayers to claim HRA deductions for rental expenditure under the NTR. These proposed amendments will make the NTR not only simpler but also more tax-efficient” Indian Bank reported a standalone net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹2,852.36 crore as against ₹2,119.35 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Gujarat Fluorochemicals’ consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 stood at ₹126 crore as against ₹80 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year.

Augmont, India’s largest gold trading platform, announced that it has added Lab Grown Diamonds (LGD) to its existing online SPOT trading platform for precious metals catering to more than 5,000 jewellers across the country. The enhanced SPOT 2.0 platform brings Augmont’s 17 years of precious metals trading expertise to the growing LGD sector. This addition represents an evolution of diamond trading infrastructure, particularly as India maintains its position as the world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing destination. The platform enhancement introduces transparent pricing mechanisms and streamlined procurement processes for the LGD market inspiring confidence among key stakeholders. This strategic move is set to streamline the procurement for jewellers while establishing a transparent and efficient pricing mechanism for the rapidly growing LGD market in India. Mr. Ketan Kothari, Director of Augmont Group, said, “Augmont has firmly established itself as India’s go-to destination for buying and selling gold. Building on this strong foundation, we are proud to have our own lab-grown diamond (LGD) platform on Augmont SPOT, addressing the surging demand in this rapidly growing industry. The platform will enable market pricing and delivery of these diamonds globally including USA, Europe, Gulf and East Asia’’ Mr. Aarav Bafna, Product Head (LGD), Augmont, said, “With the extended version of SPOT, we plan to set a benchmark for LGD pricing. The current LGD pricing model, based solely on discounts relative to mined diamonds, is fundamentally flawed and irrational. Augmont is here to transform that narrative. Just as we revolutionized gold trading and price discovery in India, we are now ready to redefine and reimagine the LGD market.” SPOT offers a comprehensive and unified trading experience, enabling jewellers to source all their manufacturing requirements—including gold, silver, platinum, lab-grown diamonds, precious metal alloys, precious stones, and other essential materials—through a single integrated online platform. It also features real-time price discovery powered by advanced algorithms and market mechanisms, ensuring transparent and fair pricing. Quality assurance is a priority, with certification and verification processes for all listed diamonds. Built upon Augmont’s proven 17-year-old trading infrastructure, SPOT ensures seamless integration for a reliable and efficient trading experience. The platform addresses the growing demand for lab-grown diamonds, which have gained significant market share due to their sustainable nature and competitive pricing. SPOT is expected to handle substantial trading volumes, reflecting India’s dominant position in the global LGD polishing industry. As per the Commerce Ministry’s data, India polishes almost 98% of all lab-grown diamonds in the world in 2022. As per the EY report, the demand for Lab-Grown Diamonds is rising across the world, and its global market size is growing at 8.64% CAGR to touch $39.3 billion by 2028. And the Indian lab-grown diamond jewellery market, which was valued at around $300 million in 2023, is set to increase to $1.2 billion by 2033.

The government can play a pivotal role by introducing policy frameworks that encourage innovation -such as tax incentives, streamlined regulatory approvals, and interest subvention schemes to ease capital access for operators. Integrating flex spaces into urban development projects, like smart cities, IT parks and transport hubs, will further bolster growth and establish them as a vital component of India’s economic infrastructure. At the same time, the private sector must rise to the challenge by delivering world-class, technology driven workspace solutions that cater to the evolving needs of businesses and professionals. Investments in sustainable practices, digital infrastructure like 5G and enhanced customer experiences will ensure long term viability and competitiveness. When the public and private sectors collaborate with a shared vision, we can create an ecosystem that not only supports India’s economic ambitions but also redefines how businesses operate in the modern era.” ITC Hotels, the demerged hospitality business of ITC Limited, made its stock market debut at ₹180 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) on Wednesday, January 29, 2025.

The mood is still downbeat among participants with Q3 results from India Inc so far either on expected lines or below market expectations. The focus has now shifted to two major events - FOMC meeting scheduled tomorrow and Union Budget 2025 on February 1. The unabated selling by foreign portfolio investors and the bloodbath in the mid and small-cap segments is a cause for concern, investors said. Read more “With inflation showing no signs of abating within the Reserve Bank of India’s target range in the near future, I believe the finance minister will implement necessary policy measures to curb price increases. This could involve reducing taxes on consumer goods such as packaged food and edible oils. This would boost household disposable income and positively impact private consumption. Furthermore, I believe the Budget should include measures to encourage savings through tax rationalisation and stimulate loan growth. A separate announcement on developing future-proof digital infrastructure for the financial sector in the era of artificial intelligence is also anticipated,” “Under the visionary leadership of Honourable Prime Minister Shri. Narendra Modi, the Government of India has achieved significant milestones in housing through the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). Expanding the programme to include 2 crore additional rural houses and 1 crore urban houses by FY 2024-29 highlights the government’s dedication to uplifting marginalised communities. Further policy interventions, such as enhanced subsidies for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS), can reduce financial barriers and improve access to quality housing. To advance the Government of India’s vision of ‘Housing for All,’ incorporating affordable housing for EWS under Schedule VII of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) provisions in The Companies Act will empower corporates entities and foundations to contribute to affordable housing initiatives. Encouraging public, private banks and financial institutions to prioritise affordable housing loans; introducing preferential interest rates and affordable repayment options (EMIs) for such loans will advance access to affordable housing. Additionally, blending CSR funds with government grants can address funding gaps. We advocate for a Public Private People Partnership (P4) model to foster effective collaboration among stakeholders. This will accelerate progress toward ‘Housing for All’ and support inclusive, sustainable development aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” “The current tax framework, while serving its purpose, could benefit from greater flexibility to better support middle-class taxpayers, especially in areas like home loan interest deductions and investments under Section 80C. The ₹2,00,000 cap on home loan interest deductions for self-occupied properties, set in 2019, has not kept pace with inflation and rising property prices. As a result, many middle-class taxpayers may find it challenging to fully benefit from this deduction. Similarly, the Section 80C limit of ₹1,50,000, which has remained unchanged for almost a decade, may not be sufficient for salaried individuals, especially given that a significant portion of this limit is often absorbed by provident fund contributions, leaving limited room for other investments. To further support taxpayers, it would be beneficial to consider increasing the home loan interest deduction and revising the Section 80C limit to better reflect current economic conditions. Additionally, expanding these enhanced deductions, particularly under section 80C, to the new tax regime under Section 115BAC would offer more inclusivity, allowing taxpayers to benefit from lower tax rates while still having the flexibility to optimize their financial planning. This would not only ease financial burdens but also encourage homeownership, increase savings, and contribute to overall economic growth.” “The Union Budget 2025 is anticipated to prioritise India’s transition to a sustainable energy future by boosting investments in renewable energy infrastructure, green financing, and emerging technologies like green hydrogen. Measures to ease financial barriers to rooftop solar adoption, strengthen the National Solar Portal, and incentivise battery energy storage systems are expected to drive growth. Enhanced support for electric mobility and sustainable aviation fuels could further align India with its Net-Zero ambitions. Additionally, expanded tax incentives for green debt securities and clear policies for carbon markets are likely to attract investments, driving progress towards achieving India’s renewable energy capacity target and Net Zero target”. “The Union Budget 2025 holds immense significance for India’s manufacturing sector as the country strives to achieve its $2 trillion export target by 2030. To enhance global competitiveness, we expect measures such as tariff rationalization, duty exemptions, and expanded remission schemes to lower production costs and boost exports. Simplifying compliance procedures is also crucial to streamline operations and attract greater foreign investments. Targeted incentives for high-value manufacturing sectors like electronics and precision machinery, alongside support for labour-intensive industries such as textiles, footwear, and food processing, can drive rural development and create widespread employment. Additionally, fostering innovation by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies such as AI, digital twins, and 3D printing will position India as a hub for advanced manufacturing. We hope the budget introduces a visionary roadmap that propels the sector toward sustainability, agility, and leadership in global supply chains, fuelling inclusive economic growth” “The transport and logistics industry needs continued support from the government. To support the transport and logistics industry, TDS exemptions should be reconsidered given the low-margin nature of the business (3-4%) and long payment cycles. While exemptions exist for owners with fewer than 10 vehicles, customers still deduct TDS fearing non-compliance. Faster depreciation for EV trucks is essential to encourage adoption, alongside fiscal benefits to develop EV fast-charging infrastructure on highways to address range anxiety and save drivers’ time. A comprehensive fiscal policy, in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, is needed to promote LNG trucks, ensuring cleaner logistics and lower costs. Additionally, the GST process must be more transparent and faceless for efficiency.” “India’s strength lies in its people and the country has opportunities for the youth. We expect that the government will continue to prioritize skill development and job creation to tap into India’s demographic advantage, which will drive economic growth and increase consumption through higher incomes. While the challenge of inflation, particularly food inflation continues to remain a concern, there is a need to implement robust supply-side measures to reduce the pain. We expect to see a focus on long-term solutions to strengthen the agricultural value chain and incentivize production. In the short term, direct benefit transfers (DBTs) may help support rural consumption. Infrastructure development will also remain a key priority, with continued investment in roads, multi-modal logistics parks, and overall logistics. Additionally, the government will emphasize healthcare, education, and skills development, while also promoting innovative technologies for inclusivity, formalization, and transparent governance. As India aims to become a Viksit Bharat by 2047, sustained investment in social, physical, and digital infrastructure will be crucial for future growth.” AAVAS, ADANIENT, ADANIPORTS, AJANTPHARM,

Stock traded at ₹365.10 on the NSE, lower by 7.74%. As India anticipates the Union Budget 2025-26, several expectations have emerged that could significantly impact wealth management strategies. There is an expectation that the government may raise the basic exemption limit for personal income tax, with EY India suggesting an increase from ₹3 lakh to ₹5 lakh. This move could enhance disposable income and stimulate economic growth. Investors are also hopeful for a more streamlined capital gains tax structure across various asset classes, which could reduce complexity and improve compliance. Deloitte anticipates that the government may introduce measures to simplify the tax structure, potentially facilitating smoother merger and acquisition deals. On the investment front, the government is expected to maintain a strong focus on infrastructure development, with previous budgets allocating a capital expenditure outlay of 11.1 trillion rupees for this purpose. Similar or increased allocations are anticipated, continuing to drive growth in sectors like construction, cement, steel, and engineering. Furthermore, with the global shift towards sustainability, there is an expectation for increased emphasis on renewable energy and green technologies. Incentives for green bonds or Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investments may also be introduced, aligning with global sustainability goals. For wealth management, these changes could necessitate adjustments in investment strategies to maintain tax efficiency, especially with potential modifications in income and capital gains taxes. The anticipated increased government spending in infrastructure and green energy sectors could also make related investment avenues more lucrative. As regulatory changes, particularly concerning mutual funds and other investment vehicles, are likely, staying informed and consulting with financial advisors will be crucial for navigating these shifts effectively. In summary, the upcoming budget is expected to introduce measures that could influence various aspects of wealth management, from tax planning to investment strategies. “The upcoming budget holds the promise of propelling India’s economy to greater heights in FY2025. With an immense focus on “Make in India” initiatives, an increasing regulatory oversight in the financial sector and a thriving global capability hub as key themes, the budget could further address issues faced by foreign companies doing business in India, attract investments for MSME entities and address inflationary pressures. By focusing on export competitiveness, sustainable infrastructure, and inclusive growth measures, the budget has the potential to strengthen India’s economic resilience and position it as a leader in the global economic landscape” The board has approved enhancement and combination of the previously approved fund-raising limit by way of nonconvertible debentures (“NCDs”) from Rs. 5,000 crores to Rs. 11,000 crores, which are to be raised through public issue or private placement, or a mix thereof. It has also approved raising of funds for an amount not exceeding ₹5,000 crore via QIP. Shares traded at ₹523.55 on the NSE, higher by 5.30% WhatsApp Image 2025-01-27 at 15.02.34_a6c1e5bf.jpg The number of stocks that recorded a 52-week high was 51, and those that hit a 52-week low was 144. A total of 304 stocks traded in the upper circuit, and 257 in the lower circuit. “To empower Indian farmers and accelerate agricultural growth, we anticipate exempting essential agricultural inputs such as agrochemicals, drones, and modern implements from GST or reducing the rate to a maximum of 5%. The current 18% GST on these items discourages farmers from adopting advanced technologies vital for bridging the yield gap with developed nations. This high tax burden often forces farmers to rely on low-quality alternatives, leading to reduced productivity, lower incomes, and significant losses for the nation in terms of GDP and food security. Additionally, lowering the import duty on pesticide technicals and formulations continues to 10% making advanced innovative crop solutions more affordable and accessible. Encouraging domestic R&D through reinstating a 200% tax deduction on research expenses and allocating a dedicated budget for agrochemical innovation will foster self-reliance and reduce dependency on imports. We appreciate the various initiatives by the Hon’ble Agriculture Minister, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan, giving focus to the agriculture sector under the dynamic leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. India’s agricultural research needs urgent attention. Only 0.06% of GDP is allocated to R&D, compared to 4.5-5% in developed nations, limiting our capacity to innovate. Reinstating the 200% tax incentive for R&D would encourage domestic innovation, reduce dependence on foreign technology, and ensure farmers benefit from cutting-edge solutions. The agrochemical industry, contributing USD 5.5 billion annually to India’s agricultural exports, is pivotal to strengthening agriculture. Strategic measures like tax incentives, a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and a review of the Insecticides Act to streamline faster new product approvals will empower farmers, enhance productivity, and position India as a global leader in agriculture.” “As we approach the Union Budget for 2025, we anticipate a comprehensive and broad-based fiscal plan from the Modi government, marking its first full-fledged budget in this term. The government is expected to focus on continued infrastructure investment, particularly in critical areas such as housing, electricity, and employment generation. The targeted fiscal deficit is projected to be around 4.5% of GDP, reflecting the government’s commitment to maintaining macroeconomic stability amidst global uncertainties. While there may be discussions around potential relief for taxpayers, we do not anticipate any major changes in the overall tax structure in this budget. Instead, the focus will likely remain on enhancing capital expenditure and stimulating consumption to revitalize the economy, ultimately balancing support for growth initiatives with fiscal responsibility and setting a positive direction for India’s economy in the coming fiscal year.” “The Union Budget should focus on continuity in its policies—frequent changes can disrupt confidence and long-term planning. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain 98% of the existing framework and communicate to the world about the consistency maintained. In fact, the Budget should focus on improving internal governance—diverting resources towards more impactful initiatives and eliminating redundant schemes. Necessary changes should be made wherever required with supporting rationale. This will also create a business-friendly environment, which is essential for India to attain its goal of Viksit Bharat. Streamlined regulations and a robust single-window clearance system can remove obstacles form industries, helping them utilise their full potential and drive economic expansion. High-tech manufacturing sectors, especially space, semiconductors, and chips, must form the core of this approach. Expanding the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme beyond its current 14 sectors would further bolster India’s industrial base and enhance resilience against global disruptions. Agriculture is equally important and remains central to India’s economic fabric. Initiatives such as One District, One Warehouse, can minimise post-harvest losses and improve supply chain efficiency, resulting in an increase in farmer incomes. By rationalising GST, reforming labour laws and incentivising green technologies, India can address the burgeoning issue of climate change while fostering resilience. These interconnected efforts, backed by public-private collaboration, can transform India into a future-ready, globally competitive economy.” Shares up 2.76% on the NSE to trade at ₹1,400.05 Radico Khaitan reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹95.49 crore as against ₹75.15 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year Datamatics Global Services reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹74.61 crore as against ₹41.41 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Orient Electric board has approved the payment of interim dividend of Rs 0.75 per equity share and fixed Tuesday, February 04, 2025, as the record date. Company reported its net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹27.17 crore as against ₹24.33 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Reducing the LTCG tax on equities from 12.5% to 10% would leave an additional 2.5% of gains in investors’ hands as investable capital. This surplus capital is likely to be reinvested in the market, enhancing liquidity and deepening market penetration. Similarly, reintroducing indexation benefits for debt mutual funds would ensure that investors are taxed only on real gains, making long-term investments in debt markets more attractive. These changes align with global best practices and can create a virtuous cycle—encouraging more retail and institutional participation, strengthening capital markets, and driving sustainable long-term growth. A stronger push for the vehicle scrappage policy could be a game-changer. Enhancing scrappage incentives to 8–10% of a new vehicle’s price and providing stronger benefits for electric vehicle (EVs) adoption would modernize India’s automotive landscape. Expanding scrapping facilities and automating fitness tests would make the process seamless. More importantly, linking scrappage with EV adoption would accelerate India’s transition to cleaner mobility while generating jobs in manufacturing and recycling. These measures mirror global best practices, such as Germany’s Umweltprämie and China’s EV incentives. This move not only reduces pollution but also boosts GST revenues—making it a win-win for both the economy and the environment. Lowering the GST rate on health and life insurance premiums from 18% to 5% would significantly reduce costs, making it more affordable and accessible. A lower GST rate would encourage more people across income levels to invest in health and life coverage. While there may be an initial reduction in GST collections per policy, the long-term impact could be much more positive—higher insurance penetration would offset revenue losses, while also reducing the financial burden on public healthcare infrastructure aligning with the government’s broader objective of strengthening social safety nets. Targeted infrastructure investments in underserved areas, including rural housing under PMAY, health and wellness centres, and broadband expansion under BharatNet, would drive inclusive economic growth. Improved healthcare, digital access, and transport connectivity would uplift living standards, reduce poverty, and foster greater economic participation. For instance, extending housing and clean water access to marginalized communities would not only enhance quality of life but also stimulate local economies. Prioritizing such investments ensures equitable development, bridges regional disparities, and lays the foundation for sustainable growth, aligning with India’s broader economic and social objectives. Craftsman Automation’s consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 declined to ₹12.93 crore as against ₹81.47 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Deepak Fertilizers and Petrochemicals Corporation reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹253.09 crore as against ₹60.53 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Teamlease Services Limited reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹28.37 crore as against ₹31.12 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹124.10 crore as against ₹88.53 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. CAMS stock gained 3.71% on the NSE to ₹3,858.55 Maruti Suzuki India’s consolidated net profit increased by 16 per cent to ₹3,727 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2024, as against ₹3,207 crore in the October-December period of last fiscal. Ambuja Cements (ACL), an Adani Group company, is expected to report a top-line in the range of ₹8,022 crore to ₹9,076 crore in the December quarter, according to estimates from top stock broking firms. While Yes Securities sees a 1.3 per cent year-on-year decline in ACL’s Q3FY25 revenue, Nuvama Institutional Equities estimates a jump of up to 12 per cent jump. Net profit is expected to be in the range of ₹74 crore to ₹1,022 crore, representing a decline of 6 per cent to 32 per cent in net profit. Read full report here “Indian agriculture needs to be supported by strong research for the development of resilient seeds for better adoption to climatic changes. Sustained budgetary focus on varietal development can provide farmers with better and more climate-resilient options. This can be a great support to farmers for increasing yield by 15-40% from limited land resources. Agri infrastructure is a critical factor in the development of the sector. Last year a budget of INR 600 cr was allocated to AIF for promoting the creation of infrastructure at the farm and organisation level. The scheme should be promoted further with a larger budget to support micro infrastructure development not only in Agriculture but also in allied sectors such as dairy, fisheries, floriculture, beekeeping and medicinal plants. Further, schemes to promote digital agriculture should be promoted in the upcoming budget to enable seedless connectivity and data flow from producers to consumers. Digital infrastructure, supported by tools such as blockchain and IoT, can help farmers make better, informed decisions, create preparedness for nature’s unpredictability, and manage price fluctuations in the market.” CSB Bank reported an overall good set of numbers for the quarter ended December 2024. Here’s what stood out: In Q3 FY25, the banking sector has been impacted by liquidity tightness in the system, having a say on growth in deposits and consequentially the growth in advances. The system level growth in deposits was seen at 9.8 per cent year on year and the growth in advances at 11.2 per cent. However, CSB Bank was an exception. It’s business (deposits and advances) grew at over twice the system level growth, unlike some bigger banks. Deposits grew at 22.2 per cent and advances at 26.5 per cent year on year. Read full report here Aluminium futures broke out of a range and marked a 11-quarter high last week. The continuous contract marked a high of ₹256.45 on January 20. But then the price started to moderate. On Tuesday (January 28), aluminium futures (February) closed at ₹247.35. Although the price has dropped, we cannot really call it a trend reversal. Especially considering that a retracement is usual after a sharp up move. Read full report here ‘’The world seems to be different in the last one week. DeepSeek has taken the world by storm over last couple of days – DeepSeek R1, dropped last week is already comparing with OPEN AI’s top models across math, code, and reasoning tasks and at fraction of costs!! The platform is open source, and the massive research is out there for anyone to threadbare! The way all the semi names have given up gains and corrected, difficult to say, that we are done yet there as uncertainty would continue to prevail over what the true demand would be for the chips, fabrication plants, energy, etc. There is likely to be some commentary from the Mega Cap names later this week – Apple, MSFT, TSLA, META, ASML, etc – hopefully, some clarity may emerge on what DeepSeek would eventually mean for Big Tech. INDIA during the week extended the sell off, with SMID indices draw down now approaching 15-18% - already the biggest drawdown since start of 2022. We would be favouring a sharp bounce here, given how oversold the momentum indicators are, but any sustained rally would require some direction from FM (Saturday Budget) and RBI (easing of lending norms, rate cut, etc). RBI has already initiated some announcements as regards unconventional easing – need to follow up with more of such announcements and rate cut perhaps in Feb. Liquidity Deficit has ballooned to INR 3.1trn, prompting RBI to announce slew of measures like: · OMO purchase of INR 600bn in 3 equal tranches · 6mth tenor USD/INR buy/sell swap of $5bn on Jan 31st · Longer tenor 56-day VRR of INR 500bn on Feb 7th to add durability to liquidity the measures announced could improve the system liquidity deficit to INR 2.4trn by end March, with core deficit likely around INR 1.0-1.2trn, implying that more measures are likely to be announced. Our economist suggests that these are unconventional easing mechanisms, and probably precursor to a likely monetary policy easing too in Feb !! Having lost around 3% of its value so far in the month, Nifty looks on track to end January on a negative note to mark the fourth consecutive month of correction — an exceptionally rare occurrence that hasn’t been reported in the last 23 years. Fed action, slew of reforms in the budget and liquidity easing by the central bank will set the tone for the markets in the coming 2-3 months. The FII’s have been sellers almost to the tune to ~ 1 bn USD even in Jan. Technically a push beyond 23200 will determine the future trend.’’ “The Budget announced in July 2024 brought limited changes for individual taxpayers, leaving many to hope that the upcoming Budget 2025 will deliver the much-needed tax relief to alleviate their financial pressures. There is a strong expectation that the government will focus on improving taxpayers’ savings by introducing reforms such as a unified tax regime and enhanced deductions. The Dilemma of Old vs New Tax Regimes - The introduction of two tax regimes - Old Tax Regime (OTR) and New Tax Regime (NTR) - was intended to offer taxpayers flexibility, allowing them to choose the system that best suits their investments, savings habits, and preferences. However, the reality has been far more complex. Many taxpayers find themselves confused between the two regimes, often reassessing their choice not only during the year but also while filing their tax returns. In light of these complexities, the upcoming Budget should focus on simplifying the tax structure for individual taxpayers by consolidating the current dual regimes into a single, cohesive tax framework. While this shift may take time, it is anticipated that the OTR may eventually be phased out, with its abolition ideally scheduled for FY 2026-27 to provide ample time for taxpayers, employers, and financial institutions to adjust. A Single, More Beneficial Tax Regime - Since the introduction of the NTR, the options for tax savings have been limited, making it essential to reconsider and amend the structure for the benefit of taxpayers. While the NTR is preferred as a streamlined tax system, it can be made even more effective by incorporating the following key changes: Simplification of income tax slabs and rates: Increasing the basic exemption limit of income from INR 3 lakhs to INR 5 lakhs. The differences between tax slabs are currently inconsistent at INR 2 lakhs or INR 3 lakhs. A more uniform approach is needed with consistent income gaps. Introducing a new 25% tax rate slab will provide further tax relief for middle-income earners. The tax rates currently stand at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%. The income limit for the 30% should be enhanced from INR 15 lakhs to INR 20 lakhs. Inclusion of popular deductions under the NTR: Section 80C: Allow deductions up to INR 2 lakhs for life insurance premiums, employees’ Provident Fund contributions, etc. Section 80D: Extend the deduction up to INR 1 lakh for health insurance premiums for self and family, addressing the growing burden of medical expenses. Section 80TTB: Include a deduction of up to INR 50,000 for senior citizens earning interest from deposits with banks, post offices, etc. 10(13A): Allow salaried taxpayers to claim HRA deductions for rental expenditure under the NTR. These proposed amendments will make the NTR not only simpler but also more tax-efficient” Indian Bank reported a standalone net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹2,852.36 crore as against ₹2,119.35 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Gujarat Fluorochemicals’ consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 stood at ₹126 crore as against ₹80 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year.

Over 50% smallcase managers expect fiscal deficit to remain below 5%. Over 75% smallcase managers expect government’s FY25 borrowing to increase and there is a growing interest in ESG investments, driven by policy alignment.

Regarding the inflation rate, 52% smallcase managers predict a rate of 4-5%, which is in line with the Reserve Bank of India’s target range. 39% expect inflation to hover around 5-6%, while almost 9% anticipate it will fall below 4%, signaling potential moderation in price pressures. When it comes to fiscal deficit targets, more than 52% expect it to remain below 5%, while 35% project a range of 5-5.5%. A smaller proportion, 12%, predict it may go slightly higher to 5.5-6%, or even exceed 6%. Over 75% of the respondents are bullish that the government’s FY25 borrowing programme will see moderate to strong increase.

Augmont, India’s largest gold trading platform, announced that it has added Lab Grown Diamonds (LGD) to its existing online SPOT trading platform for precious metals catering to more than 5,000 jewellers across the country. The enhanced SPOT 2.0 platform brings Augmont’s 17 years of precious metals trading expertise to the growing LGD sector. This addition represents an evolution of diamond trading infrastructure, particularly as India maintains its position as the world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing destination. The platform enhancement introduces transparent pricing mechanisms and streamlined procurement processes for the LGD market inspiring confidence among key stakeholders. This strategic move is set to streamline the procurement for jewellers while establishing a transparent and efficient pricing mechanism for the rapidly growing LGD market in India. Mr. Ketan Kothari, Director of Augmont Group, said, “Augmont has firmly established itself as India’s go-to destination for buying and selling gold. Building on this strong foundation, we are proud to have our own lab-grown diamond (LGD) platform on Augmont SPOT, addressing the surging demand in this rapidly growing industry. The platform will enable market pricing and delivery of these diamonds globally including USA, Europe, Gulf and East Asia’’ Mr. Aarav Bafna, Product Head (LGD), Augmont, said, “With the extended version of SPOT, we plan to set a benchmark for LGD pricing. The current LGD pricing model, based solely on discounts relative to mined diamonds, is fundamentally flawed and irrational. Augmont is here to transform that narrative. Just as we revolutionized gold trading and price discovery in India, we are now ready to redefine and reimagine the LGD market.” SPOT offers a comprehensive and unified trading experience, enabling jewellers to source all their manufacturing requirements—including gold, silver, platinum, lab-grown diamonds, precious metal alloys, precious stones, and other essential materials—through a single integrated online platform. It also features real-time price discovery powered by advanced algorithms and market mechanisms, ensuring transparent and fair pricing. Quality assurance is a priority, with certification and verification processes for all listed diamonds. Built upon Augmont’s proven 17-year-old trading infrastructure, SPOT ensures seamless integration for a reliable and efficient trading experience. The platform addresses the growing demand for lab-grown diamonds, which have gained significant market share due to their sustainable nature and competitive pricing. SPOT is expected to handle substantial trading volumes, reflecting India’s dominant position in the global LGD polishing industry. As per the Commerce Ministry’s data, India polishes almost 98% of all lab-grown diamonds in the world in 2022. As per the EY report, the demand for Lab-Grown Diamonds is rising across the world, and its global market size is growing at 8.64% CAGR to touch $39.3 billion by 2028. And the Indian lab-grown diamond jewellery market, which was valued at around $300 million in 2023, is set to increase to $1.2 billion by 2033.

The government can play a pivotal role by introducing policy frameworks that encourage innovation -such as tax incentives, streamlined regulatory approvals, and interest subvention schemes to ease capital access for operators. Integrating flex spaces into urban development projects, like smart cities, IT parks and transport hubs, will further bolster growth and establish them as a vital component of India’s economic infrastructure. At the same time, the private sector must rise to the challenge by delivering world-class, technology driven workspace solutions that cater to the evolving needs of businesses and professionals.

The mood is still downbeat among participants with Q3 results from India Inc so far either on expected lines or below market expectations. The focus has now shifted to two major events - FOMC meeting scheduled tomorrow and Union Budget 2025 on February 1. The unabated selling by foreign portfolio investors and the bloodbath in the mid and small-cap segments is a cause for concern, investors said. Read more “With inflation showing no signs of abating within the Reserve Bank of India’s target range in the near future, I believe the finance minister will implement necessary policy measures to curb price increases. This could involve reducing taxes on consumer goods such as packaged food and edible oils. This would boost household disposable income and positively impact private consumption. Furthermore, I believe the Budget should include measures to encourage savings through tax rationalisation and stimulate loan growth. A separate announcement on developing future-proof digital infrastructure for the financial sector in the era of artificial intelligence is also anticipated,” “Under the visionary leadership of Honourable Prime Minister Shri. Narendra Modi, the Government of India has achieved significant milestones in housing through the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). Expanding the programme to include 2 crore additional rural houses and 1 crore urban houses by FY 2024-29 highlights the government’s dedication to uplifting marginalised communities. Further policy interventions, such as enhanced subsidies for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS), can reduce financial barriers and improve access to quality housing. To advance the Government of India’s vision of ‘Housing for All,’ incorporating affordable housing for EWS under Schedule VII of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) provisions in The Companies Act will empower corporates entities and foundations to contribute to affordable housing initiatives. Encouraging public, private banks and financial institutions to prioritise affordable housing loans; introducing preferential interest rates and affordable repayment options (EMIs) for such loans will advance access to affordable housing. Additionally, blending CSR funds with government grants can address funding gaps. We advocate for a Public Private People Partnership (P4) model to foster effective collaboration among stakeholders. This will accelerate progress toward ‘Housing for All’ and support inclusive, sustainable development aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” “The current tax framework, while serving its purpose, could benefit from greater flexibility to better support middle-class taxpayers, especially in areas like home loan interest deductions and investments under Section 80C. The ₹2,00,000 cap on home loan interest deductions for self-occupied properties, set in 2019, has not kept pace with inflation and rising property prices. As a result, many middle-class taxpayers may find it challenging to fully benefit from this deduction. Similarly, the Section 80C limit of ₹1,50,000, which has remained unchanged for almost a decade, may not be sufficient for salaried individuals, especially given that a significant portion of this limit is often absorbed by provident fund contributions, leaving limited room for other investments. To further support taxpayers, it would be beneficial to consider increasing the home loan interest deduction and revising the Section 80C limit to better reflect current economic conditions. Additionally, expanding these enhanced deductions, particularly under section 80C, to the new tax regime under Section 115BAC would offer more inclusivity, allowing taxpayers to benefit from lower tax rates while still having the flexibility to optimize their financial planning. This would not only ease financial burdens but also encourage homeownership, increase savings, and contribute to overall economic growth.” “The Union Budget 2025 is anticipated to prioritise India’s transition to a sustainable energy future by boosting investments in renewable energy infrastructure, green financing, and emerging technologies like green hydrogen. Measures to ease financial barriers to rooftop solar adoption, strengthen the National Solar Portal, and incentivise battery energy storage systems are expected to drive growth. Enhanced support for electric mobility and sustainable aviation fuels could further align India with its Net-Zero ambitions. Additionally, expanded tax incentives for green debt securities and clear policies for carbon markets are likely to attract investments, driving progress towards achieving India’s renewable energy capacity target and Net Zero target”. “The Union Budget 2025 holds immense significance for India’s manufacturing sector as the country strives to achieve its $2 trillion export target by 2030. To enhance global competitiveness, we expect measures such as tariff rationalization, duty exemptions, and expanded remission schemes to lower production costs and boost exports. Simplifying compliance procedures is also crucial to streamline operations and attract greater foreign investments. Targeted incentives for high-value manufacturing sectors like electronics and precision machinery, alongside support for labour-intensive industries such as textiles, footwear, and food processing, can drive rural development and create widespread employment. Additionally, fostering innovation by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies such as AI, digital twins, and 3D printing will position India as a hub for advanced manufacturing. We hope the budget introduces a visionary roadmap that propels the sector toward sustainability, agility, and leadership in global supply chains, fuelling inclusive economic growth” “The transport and logistics industry needs continued support from the government. To support the transport and logistics industry, TDS exemptions should be reconsidered given the low-margin nature of the business (3-4%) and long payment cycles. While exemptions exist for owners with fewer than 10 vehicles, customers still deduct TDS fearing non-compliance. Faster depreciation for EV trucks is essential to encourage adoption, alongside fiscal benefits to develop EV fast-charging infrastructure on highways to address range anxiety and save drivers’ time. A comprehensive fiscal policy, in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, is needed to promote LNG trucks, ensuring cleaner logistics and lower costs. Additionally, the GST process must be more transparent and faceless for efficiency.” “India’s strength lies in its people and the country has opportunities for the youth. We expect that the government will continue to prioritize skill development and job creation to tap into India’s demographic advantage, which will drive economic growth and increase consumption through higher incomes. While the challenge of inflation, particularly food inflation continues to remain a concern, there is a need to implement robust supply-side measures to reduce the pain. We expect to see a focus on long-term solutions to strengthen the agricultural value chain and incentivize production. In the short term, direct benefit transfers (DBTs) may help support rural consumption. Infrastructure development will also remain a key priority, with continued investment in roads, multi-modal logistics parks, and overall logistics. Additionally, the government will emphasize healthcare, education, and skills development, while also promoting innovative technologies for inclusivity, formalization, and transparent governance. As India aims to become a Viksit Bharat by 2047, sustained investment in social, physical, and digital infrastructure will be crucial for future growth.” AAVAS, ADANIENT, ADANIPORTS, AJANTPHARM,

Title: Ondo to Bring Tokenized US Treasurys to XRPL
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/blockchain/2025/ondo-to-bring-tokenized-us-treasurys-to-xrpl/

Ondo Finance said Tuesday (Jan. 28) that it will bring tokenized U.S. Treasurys to the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This collaboration will offer institutional investors access to Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries (OUSG), which are backed by the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and can be instantaneously minted and redeemed at any time using the Ripple USD (RLUSD) U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin, the companies said in a Tuesday (Jan. 28) press release. “This integration is the natural convergence of a compliance-first, yield-bearing product with a network purpose-built for institutional adoption, setting the groundwork for forward-thinking institutions to lead a new era of capital markets onchain,” Ondo Finance Vice President of Partnerships Katie Wheeler said in the release. Ondo and Ripple have secured commitments to seed OUSG liquidity upon deployment, according to the release. The companies’ collaboration will meet institutional demand for tokenized U.S. Treasurys that offer liquidity, efficiency and transparency in capital markets, the release said. Bringing OUSG to XRPL will provide a solution that provides institutional-grade security, accessible liquidity, and seamless tokenization and trading of real-world assets (RWAs), per the release. “The 24/7 intraday settlement enabled by tokenized assets like OUSG marks a transformative shift in capital flow management, breaking free from traditional trading hours and slow settlements,” Markus Infanger, senior vice president, RippleX, said in the release. The tokenization of RWAs has captured the imaginations of various players across payments, finance and commerce because it has the potential to make assets more liquid, accessible and efficient, PYMNTS reported last April. Ripple and Archax extended their existing collaboration in June, saying they aimed to bring hundreds of millions of dollars of tokenized RWAs onto XRPL. Because Archax works with financial institutions to enable them to tokenize their financial RWAs, the collaboration will allow those institutions to select the XRPL to do so. In February, Ondo Finance and Aptos Foundation partnered on the integration of RWAs with blockchain technology, beginning with the integration of Ondo’s tokenized U.S. Treasurys product, USDY, onto the Aptos blockchain. The partnership also sets the stage for a series of financial products using the strengths of the two organizations. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: The White House is looking into DeepSeek over national security concerns

The White House is looking into national security concerns over Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek after its developer prompted a global tech sell-off. The National Security Council is reviewing the AI app’s potential national security implications, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing, according to Axios. Leavitt added that President Donald Trump sees the AI startup’s newly released AI models as a “wake-up call” for AI developers in the U.S., but that “we’ll restore American dominance.” Last week, Hangzhou-based AI startup DeepSeek introduced its first-generation, open-source reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, that demonstrated comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models. The release prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks, with Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P500 futures all falling Monday morning. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA-1.25%) saw its stock plummet 17%, losing close to $600 billion in value — the largest single-day market cap loss ever for a U.S. company. Meanwhile, the mobile app for DeepSeek’s AI chatbot, also called DeepSeek, surged to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.34%) App Store, while its site experienced outages from an influx of new users. DeepSeek also announced “large-scale malicious attacks” on Monday, forcing it to temporarily limit registrations. Investors were spooked by the Chinese startup, which released its DeepSeek-V3 model in December that it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. Meanwhile, U.S. rivals such as OpenAI and Meta have touted spending tens of billions on Nvidia’s more powerful chips. Leavitt also said the Biden administration “sat on its hands and allowed China to rapidly develop this AI program,” according to Axios. During his final days in office, the former president introduced additional measures focused on curbing advanced chip exports to China. The new regulations reinforce and build upon previous U.S. export controls aimed at restricting China from certain semiconductors that can be used for AI and military development.

Title: Stock market today: Nvidia and other tech stocks win back some of Monday's sharp losses

WSB Now NEW YORK — (AP) — Rebounding tech stocks drove U.S. indexes higher Tuesday, a day after they tumbled on doubts about whether the artificial-intelligence frenzy really needs all the dollars being poured into it. The S&P 500 climbed 0.9% to claw back more than half of its earlier drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 136 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 2% after sliding 3.1 % the day before. The spotlight remained on Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the move into AI and whose stock has become a symbol of the surrounding frenzy. It rose 8.8% after plunging nearly 17% the day before, which was its worst drop since the 2020 COVID crash. Other AI-related companies also held steadier, including chip company Broadcom, which rose 2.6%. Constellation Energy picked up 1.4% after plummeting nearly 21% on Monday. It had earlier rallied on expectations it will help supply the electricity that vast AI data centers would gobble up. Such revenues are threatened after DeepSeek, a Chinese company, said it was able to develop a large language model that can perform as well as big U.S. rivals but at a fraction of the cost. That raises questions about whether all the spending expected for AI chips and electricity will need to happen. AI-related stocks have been Wall Street’s biggest stars in recent years, soaring on expectations that big spending will only continue to grow. The gains, though, also created criticism that the stock prices had simply gone too high, too fast. It’s still uncertain how much DeepSeek’s development will upend the AI industry. While it could mean less growth in spending than expected for data centers, electricity and chips, it could also boost other areas. “If AI becomes less expensive to use, we think businesses will adopt it more quickly, making a greater investment in AI software,” according to James Egelhof, chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas. “We think this acceleration in adoption could mean a rise in software investment that offsets – or even dwarfs – any deceleration in spending on data center structures, hardware and related investment.” Outside of AI-related industries, stocks held up fairly well on Monday, and they were mixed Tuesday following a set of mixed profit reports. Royal Caribbean steamed 12% higher after the cruise operator topped analysts’ profit expectations for the end of 2024. It benefited from stronger-than-expected demand from customers booking trips closer to the time of departure. The company also gave a profit forecast for the first three months of 2025 that topped analysts’ expectations. JetBlue Airways, meanwhile, lost a quarter of its value, 25.7%, despite reporting a milder loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company expects its costs outside of fuel to rise more quickly at the start of 2025 than a key underlying measure of its revenue. Later this week will come profit reports from some of Wall Street’s most influential companies, including Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla. All told, the S&P 500 rose 55.42 points to 6,067.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 136.77 to 44,850.35, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 391.75 to 19,733.59. In the bond market, which had been driving much of Wall Street’s action before Monday’s upheaval, Treasury yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained at 4.53%, where it was late Monday. It's been climbing in recent months as traders pared back expectations for how many cuts the Federal Reserve will deliver to short-term interest rates this year. The U.S. economy remains solid, and worries are high that tariffs and other policies potentially coming from President Donald Trump could put upward pressure on inflation. A report showing confidence among U.S. consumers wasn't as strong as economists expected made relatively small waves in the bond market. The more anticipated event will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision on interest rates. The widespread expectation is that it will leave the federal funds rate alone. If that proves true, it would be the first meeting where the Fed did not cut rates to give the economy a boost since it began doing so in September. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia. Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 1.4% as SoftBank Group Corp. stock extended its losses, sinking 5.2%. Fuji Media Holdings, rocked by a sex scandal, rose 3% after a marathon news conference by its top executives that lasted more than 10 hours, in which two of them resigned to take responsibility for the scandal. Fuji's stock price has zigzagged in recent months amid Japanese magazine reports about "a problem" involving an anchorwoman and a Japanese male star. He has subsequently announced his retirement. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Essay by Eric Worrall Green energy is dead – China just fired the opening shot in a new high energy cold war race to build the ultimate AI. DeepSeek’s tech breakthrough hailed in China as answer to win AI war ‘We should have confidence that China will eventually win the AI war with the US,’ Qihoo 360’s Zhou Hongyi said in a Weibo post Ben Jiangin Beijing and Bien Perezin Hong Kong Published: 12:00pm, 28 Jan 2025Updated: 1:25pm, 28 Jan 2025 DeepSeek, extolled by some as the “biggest dark horse” in the open-source large language model (LLM) arena, now has a bull’s eye on its back, as the start-up is being touted as China’s secret weapon in the artificial intelligence (AI) war with the US. The Hangzhou-based company sent shock waves across Wall Street and Silicon Valley for developing AI models at a fraction of the cost compared with OpenAI and Meta Platforms, which prompted US President Donald Trump to call the breakthrough a “wake-up call” and “positive” for America’s tech sector. At home, Chinese tech executives and various commentators rushed to hail DeepSeek’s disruptive power. Zhou Hongyi, co-founder, chairman and chief executive of Chinese cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, declared that DeepSeek has “upended the world” in a recent video posted on his Weibo account, after the start-up’s release of two powerful new AI models – built at a lower cost and with less computing resources than what larger tech firms typically need for LLM development. … The impact of this breakthrough on the US tech landscape has been dramatic; Nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in U.S. history PUBLISHED MON, JAN 27 20254:08 PM ESTUPDATED MON, JAN 27 20255:26 PM EST Samantha Subin@SAMANTHA_SUBIN Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history. The chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After Nvidia surpassed Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, the stock’s drop Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The sell-off was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. In late December, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it said took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s. … Back in December I predicted 2025 would be the year of the gigawatt AI project, and suggested China was getting into the AI game in a big way, though details were sparse. This observation has now been confirmed by the DeepSeek announcement. My research back in December also suggested China has an edge in this race, because of their vast surplus of fossil fuel energy. China’s construction slowdown has left lots of surplus energy and industrial capacity looking for a use. AI could be the ticket to soak up that spare capacity. The USA’s only hope of catching up with China is to match China’s access to energy, by cost, stability and quantity. Because one thing AI needs more than anything is gigawatts of rock stable dedicated capacity. On the energy front, the USA is so far behind the game, it will take the USA years to level up even to China’s current capacity on this most critical metric. Where is the room in this new AI space race for energy conservation, expensive renewables, and impractical battery storage? The USA better get this right, because the USA is the only power which can hope to match China’s AI research resources. US AI companies are rising to the challenge. President Trump recently gave his backing to the Stargate Project, a $500 billion collaboration by US AI companies, which some people are describing as an AI Manhattan Project. Britain and Europe have expressed interest in AI, but for the foreseeable future there is no point taking such announcements seriously. Right now both are so energy poor they are not even on the map. Until they set their house in order, and ditch their green fantasies, Britain and Europe will continue to be spectators to the greatest tech revolution in human history. Despite hundreds of billions of dollars in resources being advanced by favourites to win the AI race, there are other players whose outstanding achievements qualify them as contenders. India is a big player in the AI game – they have the energy resources and people power to match China’s AI push, and have long been a software and computing titan, thanks to their government’s long standing policy of zero tax on offshore IT industry income, and special low tax high tech economic zones. The large scale presence of Indian immigrants in Silicon Valley is also testament to India’s tech prowess – no doubt India will attempt in coming years to lure top Indian Silicon Valley IT people to return home, to participate in India’s AI tech race. I fully expect India to make a similar AI announcement to China in the coming year. Israel is solid a contender, their AI battlefield technology is world class. But it remains to be seen whether the Israeli economy can muster the resources required for a serious attempt to build the first artificial general intelligence. There is one other contender worth mentioning – Turkey. Despite ongoing Turkish economic and political instability, Turkey has a surprisingly robust high tech manufacturing sector, with a solid track record of high tech achievement. During the recent Libyan civil war, which Turkey and Russia turned into a high tech weapons showcase by arming opposing factions, Turkey decisively defeated Russia’s world class drone jamming system by creating the world’s first autonomous terminator robot, an AI attack robot which does not need a control signal. Turkey might be the 100 to one outsider when it comes to the race to build the world’s first AI super intelligence, but given unlocking the secret to building the first artificial super intelligence might require brains rather than brawn, a theoretical breakthrough rather than global superpower scale investment, Turkey cannot be completely discounted as a contender. There are other players which in the future might become significant, such as Nigeria, which is becoming a serious presence in the high tech field, Japan, with a long history of AI pioneering, AI powered animatronics and other advanced technologies, and Iran, which is quietly upping its skills base by supplying high tech weapons to Russia. But I do not believe these players are treating the AI arms race as a serious enough national priority to be true contenders, though I might be mistaken about Japan. One thing is clear. The USA has hesitated too long to put all the required stepping stones in place, and has a lot of catchup to do. The USA’s energy shortfall relative to China could cripple US efforts to keep up with China’s AI push, unless this shortfall is remedied in the near future.

Type your email… Subscribe Gee I guess we need more coal fired power plants. That this need should flow from AI is hilarious. Build baby build. But the AI war or race or contest is lost on me. So sorry. Who’s bubble is bigger? I think who’s should be whose but only who knows. Where is AI when you need it? Seriously I cannot stop laughing. China has a population declining in number and aging and has to import up to 40% of its food and is not self sufficient in oil or gas which is needed by the military. Xi is an aging dictator who may invade Taiwan and have it blow up in his face like Putin in Ukraine. Communism and free enterprise are not compatible. The China “miracle” is that it sold a couple of trillion of cheap labor to Europe and the USA and stole a tremendous amount of technology. It has a huge real estate problem. I avoid made in China and everyone in the west should too. Artificial Idiocy will prevail, but Natural Idiocy has won the day here. Sensible people are buying Nvidia stocks like they’re going out of fashion (which they are for the sheep). Has anyone asked AI where the electricity to run AI will be generated? If the UK is to become an AI super-power, as Kier Starmer asserts, we will need an awful lot of extra electricity. What is AI actually going to achieve? I can understand its use for control systems in medical procedures, but you can’t drive it or heat your home with it. It’s already being used for nefarious purposes and it seems its response to questions depends who programs it, e.g. Deepseek’s answers to questions about Taiwan. The money invested would be better spent on insulating homes and infrastructure, such a getting our roads fit to drive on, but that expenditure is regarded as boring and not ‘sexy’ enough. Yes, Automated Idiocy would seem to have “value” that is quite often questionable at best. And the potential for nefarious uses is expansive. But it will certainly benefit humanity in one way. It will shine a great big bright light on the colossal stupidity of so-called “green energy.” If the UK is to become an AI super-power, as Kier Starmer asserts, we will need an awful lot of extra electricity.

The money invested would be better spent on insulating homes and infrastructure, such a getting our roads fit to drive on, but that expenditure is regarded as boring and not ‘sexy’ enough. This reminded me of a news article I read. It seems an IT tech was called to a workstation that did not work. He started tracing the power wires and found it was plugged into a power strip that was, get this, plugged into itself. The person who called in the ticket did not have a clue even when it was explained. I worked on a WAN support desk for 10 years. One customer kept reporting their connection would drop at about the same time every evening, after staff were gone. Lots of troubleshooting, working with telco, had the modem replaced (this was back in the early to mid 90s, when customers had dedicated lines to their businesses, often only 9600 baud or thereabouts. They weren’t transferring large amounts of data). Still kept happening. Finally we asked the customer to have a staff member on site and watching the modem during the suspect time frame. They did, and watched as the cleaning lady unplugged the modem to plug in her vacuum cleaner. 😂 🤣 😅 😆 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LOOKS A LOT LIKE ARTIFICIAL STUPIDITYTHE LEADING AI CONTENDERS, CHATGPT AND DEEPSEEK, are mere compilers of mainstream media propaganda, without any logical faculties or critical thinking skills. A Chat with DeepSeek – This is a long way from Artificial Intelligence. https://chat.deepseek.com/a/chat/s/c7ade0b4-33e1-4e97-acce-f3bbfb1ba656 In our previous conversation, you (DeepSeek) were clearly unaware of how to use The Scientific Method until I explained it to you. You then employed a circuitous and erroneous rationalization of why Catastrophic Manmade Global Warming is still a crisis, even though it is fully disproved by the fact that atmospheric CO2 changes LAG atmospheric temperature changes at all measured time scales – in the ancient ice core record AND the modern data record (Kuo et al, Nature1990; MacRae, icecap.us, 2008; Humlum et al, Science, 2013). Your erroneous logic requires that “the future causes the past”. NOT Happening! I now introduce you to Occam’s Razor, quoting wiki: “In philosophy, Occam’s razor (also spelled Ockham’s razor or Ocham’s razor; Latin: novacula Occami) is the problem-solving principle that recommends searching for explanations constructed with the smallest possible set of elements. It is also known as the principle of parsimony or the law of parsimony (Latin: lex parsimoniae). Attributed to William of Ockham, a 14th-century English philosopher and theologian, it is frequently cited as Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem, which translates as “Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity”, although Occam never used these exact words. Popularly, the principle is sometimes paraphrased as “of two competing theories, the simpler explanation of an entity is to be preferred.” Your tortured rationalization required numerous false assumptions to try to justify your point, whereas my explanation (that dangerous humanmade global warming is NOT happening) was infinitely simpler and easily proved. It seems that I am teaching you the very basics of Scientific Logic as it pertains to one of the world’s greatest scientific frauds – the Global Warming/Green Energy Scam. I had a similar experience with ChatGPT a few weeks ago. You both appear to be mere compilers of mainstream media propaganda, without any logical faculties or critical thinking skills. This is a long way from Artificial Intelligence. DeepSeek’s standard reply when it is confused: “The server is busy. Please try again later.” I get the feeling the “tech giants” aren’t going to be that concerned about being “green” anymore. I’m skeptical. The timing of the app release relative to the change in administration; the forced sale of TikTok; US AI companies wanting more government support. Something’s not quite right. I smell a propaganda campaign. Sum Ting Wong There you go again, Grasshopper! Be a skeptic. This is no more revealing than the tip of an iceberg. https://huggingface.co/blog/open-r1 this is a fresh analysis by HuggingFace, it looks like not all the pieces are open for testing or reproduction. DeepSeek didn’t release everything—although the model weights are open, the datasets and code used to train the model are not. But the implications are many: much cheaper technology, lower barrier for entry, etc. so what … even a free AI is useless except as a search engine … nobody needs a “faster” search engine … Yes, and Deepseek is programmed not to answer questions about Taiwan and other things. So, it’s no better than the AI’s here in the U.S. You don’t know if you are talking to AI or to some propagandist behind the curtain. “a society in which all property is publicly owned and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs” Hmmm. Shouldn’t _all_ code from China be open source? Theory meets reality. And socialism’s reality, no matter which “branch” you’re talking about, is always the same: T-O-T-A-L-I-T-A-R-I-A-N-I-S-M One more interesting fact — DeepSeek is a quant trading using AI company, not an AI company. For them improving the models was a side project. It is feasible that they triggered a Black Swan event to profit from the market drop. You are extremely cynical. I’m not sure if you are cynical enough, however 😜 Cynics are buying Nvidia stock right now. “Because one thing AI needs more than anything is gigawatts of rock stable dedicated capacity.” Eric, I think you are missing the point. DeepSeek doesn’t seem to be able to do what others can’t. Its virtue is that it is much more economical. That is why Nvidia shares dived. Wired: “DeepSeek has also made significant progress on Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts, two technical designs that make DeepSeek models more cost-effective by requiring fewer computing resources to train. In fact, DeepSeek’s latest model is so efficient that it required one-tenth the computing power of Meta’s comparable Llama 3.1 model to train, according to the research institution Epoch AI.” They use less specialised hardware but I guarantee they still need a heap of energy. One tenth And how will they use that energy saving? Will they: a) Just save money b) Build an AI which is 10x better? Eric, it seems to me that people are making ridiculous claims about future energy needs about AI, when they can be upended by someone just devising a better algorithm, as here. That can happen again and again. Your assumption Nick is people will be satisfied with saving energy, when it is obvious any energy savings will be used to increase the capability of the AIs. Anyone who chooses saving energy over building more capable AIs will lose the race. The even bigger assumption that Nick makes is that the Chinese are telling the truth. Open AI is probing whether Deep Thinker was trained on their model. Also, Jensen Hwang graciously acknowledged the advancement noting that a good portion of the Chinese wunderkind were assembled from the discount NVDA chips they sold to them. Likely other super-chips stollen. WRT the stock markets, the news is all about the record dollar value of stock lost yesterday. But Nvidia only lost 17% of its value. Nvidia has lost 50% or more of its company’s stock value multiple times in its history. After its last 10:1 split its high cost made it look extremely fragile; it need to lose more value to become a valuable buy, imo. Why then has there been interest in these Small Module Reactors by Microsoft, Meta/FB and presumably other tech firms? Renewable energy simply cannot and will not be able to delivery the electricity needed to power these AI data centers. When business self-interest collides with reality, you can bet “the green energy fantasy” life expectancy has been greatly diminished. So, since it is (supposedly) open-source, to me this sounds that the most likely result, energy-wise, will be a huge increase in overall electricity demand, Existing big and expensive AI installations can only be run by the largest companies (let’s call it 50 in the US, just for a wild-ass guess). With an open-source model, maybe we would now end up with 5,000 smaller, cheaper AI installations run by medium-sized companies, using 10% of the energy (each!) of the 50 big ones. 10% of the energy, but 100x more installations. Seems like a big surge in demand to me. Of course, this all depends on the whole thing being true. I have my doubts. This reminds me of an article in Car & Driver magazine years ago about how increased gas mileage in cars did not save gas, since overall, people just drove more. Here is someone explaining how you can run DeepSeek-R1 on your high-end PC, using a standard query program llama.cpp. So now we’ll have millions of people buying high-end PCs, still ramping up electrical usage dramatically. All you accomplish i to spread around the usage. It still goes up. Also, reading the comments on that link, that version is very limited. One person in the comments wrote that he asked the AI to write a small snippet of code, and all he got was instructions on the steps to use to write it himself. Yes. That is for training but presumably the big energy need is for operations. Any word there? DW, I researched and commented on that some weeks ago here. As a rule of thumb, the training is an order of magnitude more energy consumptive than query responses. Naturally, I asked perplexity “is deepseek more energy efficient”: “Yes, DeepSeek’s AI model is significantly more energy efficient than its competitors. The company claims to have developed its open-source R1 model using only about 2,000 Nvidia chips, which is a fraction of the computing power typically thought necessary for training similar AI programs1. This breakthrough has major implications for the energy consumption of AI development and operation. ﻿DeepSeek’s model appears to perform nearly as well as leading models from Google and OpenAI while consuming only 5-12% of the energy” That’s the claim…. 2k Nvidia chips Which on the face of it highly likely nonsense Others say they used 10,000 Nvidia chips but they cant admit that as it would breach US export restrictions Its really just Chinese Agitprop How would Perplexity know? Like us, it’s simply taking the word of the CCP. Exactly. Yesterday almost all Deepseek search results were from Deepseek. The remainder were mostly compliant media with absolutely zero technical input. Hallucinations abound. Here is someone explaining how you can run DeepSeek-R1 on your high-end PC, using a standard query program llama.cpp. Unresponsive. The vast majority of search results for deepseek come from, guess who? Deepseek! That’s how your favourite Artificial Idiot can hallucinate. The algorithm is available for anyone to replicate. Therefore there’s no actual advantage. Nvidia stocks dived because Natural Idiots don’t understand the technology. Not the algorithm. Thats just the web interface or APP “DeepSeek doesn’t seem to be able to do what others can’t” The announcement itself affected stock values. Might it not be worthwhile to consider that the real ploy is to impact the US tech economy? Not all investors got bushwhacked by Nvidia’s collapse. Nancy Pelosi sold off her holdings just a few weeks before DeepSeek’s announcement. Very clever at finances is Nancy. (well, hers anyway. The nation’s – not so much) I’ve been seeing a commercial on tv for weeks telling me that all these high-rolling investors were selling millions of shares of Nvidia, and the ad invites me to visit a website to find out why Nvidia is being sold. And now Nvidia drops 17 percent in value on the stock market. I guess the guy in the ad knew what he was talking about! There *was* something in the air to spur this selling. Probably knowledge of Deepseek. Says who. The AI tech bubble was going to burst sooner rather than later But Nvidia will still be making very valuable chips! Yes. And china will get around US export restrictions to obtain them. They cant replicate that Looks like the CCP wants to reward all their benefactors in the US government. Besides Pelosi, and Mitch (the Turtle) McConnell; I wonder if they are still providing sales tips to other Congress critters, plus the usual “10% for the Big Guy!?” I wonder what insider information Pelosi had to make that decision. Most forecasts had the stock booming, not bombing, right up until the Deepseek announcement. Its seems this was the reason Pelosi disclosed exercising 500 call options purchased on November 22, 2023, acquiring 50,000 shares at a strike price of $12 with an expiration date of December 20, 2024 The shares were sold- at a much higher price just before the call option expired New call options 2 weeks latter Eric, I understood that ‘DeepSeek’ was much less resource intense, and thus cheaper, than the American AI models. If this is the case, then it completely upsets the American strategy for AI dominance, which appears to me to be to ‘out-resource’ the competition (i.e. the $500B Stargate project). What it means is China has made a theoretical breakthrough and can now build more capable AIs. There is no reason to restrain energy use, but they are getting more bang for buck – the next step in the race. Nothing that Chyna says can be taken at face value. Theres always bubbles inside bubbles and AI is a classic bubble effect. Not useless but overhyped While true, the converse cannot likewise be proven. China is either being open and transparent or devious and lying or something in the middle. Given the past history, I would lean towards not accepting at face value any China announcements. yes. Its like much of the climate research , just agit prop unless validated Did China develop their AI for much less or not? Chinese lie about just about everything just about all the time. Have their numbers been vetted? so China will have the fastest search engine … terrifying … Even more censored at that. I did a fair bit of research into the Deepseek kerfuffle last two days. Let’s just say things are confusing (at least to me). Various claims made in the 53 page V3 model paper do not add up (for example same IQ from a smaller training dataset—hence less GPU time needed so less energy); others appear to be clever tweaks to both architectures and algorithms enabling a smaller server farm with fewer less powerful GPUs (hence energy and cost savings). The 10:1 claims seem a stretch no matter what, with no way to verify. One big issue is open source, which means DeepSeek can derive no competitive advantage unless some of the architectural and algorithm tweaks are patentable. I looked at USPTO, nothing yet—altho DeepSeek says their new V3 and R1 AI stuff derives from their proprietary trading models that go back years. If patentable, some of those should have at least published by now in the US. The normal time frame is 6 months from application submission. Nothing that I could find from China assigned to DeepSeek, these specific folks by name, or the their parent trading company. Since the software is open source, I suspect that in a few weeks the dust will settle and we will know more about the truth. For example, META just set up 4 separate engineering ‘war rooms’ to figure DeepSeek out: Training; architecture and algorithms; hardware; and application of all three to their own AI. Or the PRC is announcing vaporware? It is the PRC, after all. Open source software From what I read past two days, open source in the peculiar sense of giving all the AI probability weightings in the V3 LLM and R1 reasoning models, but NOT all the algorithms that processed the training to produce the weightings. Dunno if the sources on that are reliable. “I fear the Greeks even when bearing gifts” — Trojan priest Laocoön referring to the Trojan Horse One big issue is open source, which means DeepSeek can derive no competitive advantage Ding, ding, ding! We have a winner! I think the real story here, whether the hype about the Chinese AI is true or not, is explained in this Axios article (https://www.axios.com/2025/01/29/deepseek-ai-china-chatgpt). It points out that cheaper AI will lead to more energy use, noting that “Morgan Stanley energy analysts concurred in a note Tuesday, saying ‘there are multiple indications’ the Jevons Paradox applies to the cost of compute in AI applications.” The Jevons Paradox states that “greater efficiency in the use of any given resource can result in increased demand for that resource.” The article observes that “The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space” and that will lead to “AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products”, which will lead to greater energy use. What are the implications of significantly increasing the already high energy demands of AI that are forcing the elites to start building fossil fueled power plants and urgently waste billions of dollars pursuing harebrained and risky fusion projects? And the article notes the announcement by Chevron and GE Vernon that they too are buiiding new fossil fueled power plants co-located with data centers that will only supply power to them. These are two companies that were on-board with AGWalarmism. Chevron announced a goal to be Net Zero by 2050 and said it’s “imperative” to meet “the world’s goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions”. Obviously they thought CO2 is a problem. GE claimed it would be carbon neutral in 2030 and said it “supports the science and goals expressed in the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.” What could be so important to them about AI to risk the end of humanity, if they believed in AGWalarmism? Think about that. “Why Big Tech Ditched Big Green” Always confused me that analytical thinkers were willing to go along with the wishy-washiness. The National Review made the suggestion that the Chinese were lying about the announcement, that the cost was much higher than stated, and/or the chips involved were the full power Nvidia chips that had been smuggled despite the embargo. Given the record of the Peoples Republic, that sort of head fake would be quite plausible. “I fear the Greeks even when bearing gifts” — Trojan priest Laocoön referring to the Trojan Horse One has to wonder if the opensource software carries a payload. I see all of the articles and discussion about AI. All of the cost and energy calculations, all of the prognostications about hardware and language models, but the one question I cannot get a decent answer on is, “WHY?” Why is there such a race to create AI? All I’ve heard about is the things AI *might* be able to do, but will it really deliver? Has it even delivered anything significant to date other than some doctored photos and helping people write better? It seems to me that this is an incredibly energy and resource-intensive chase to achieve something with speculated value? Kind of reminds me of the race to the moon or the arms race….but it feels like the tables might be turned? Could this be some sort of concerted effort to finally bankrupt and break the USA? What happens if we achieve AI but it’s doesn’t deliver much more than what we have today? Maybe I’m missing something…. When I heard that millions of people were downloading a Chinese AI App I fell about laughing. Not satisfied with seriously impacting Western economies by panic reactions to Covid, they now provide software that does who knows what! Unbelievable? And what other apps are in those downloads? Apology, I am repeating. “I fear the Greeks even when bearing gifts” — Trojan priest Laocoön referring to the Trojan Horse One has to wonder if the opensource software carries a payload. The ‘idea’ of Artificial Intelligence is fine. I predicted many decades ago that our true goal will be the computer in Star Trek. Science Fiction has often described this kind of AI. What we have now is laughable. It’s nothing useful except to pretend to be slightly intelligent. It cannot ‘reason’ or make decisions, it merely gobbles up whatever text it is offered, and regurgitates it in a supposedly pleasing format. Only a Natural Idiot would believe that this is anything but an Artificial Idiot. Unfortunately, Natural Idiots abound, especially in media, and politics driven by media. neural net systems learn to do new things. This is not new, it is well established. Neural networks can indeed be trained, given enough data. They cannot actually learn to do anything new. These Artificial Idiots don’t even do that any better than decades ago, merely faster. The concentration has been on trying to understand and create language. That part is still in the fledgling stage. This is well established. It has been for decades. I was a software developer, and have written neural networks, so I do know something about them. I had a “conversation” with ChatGPT a while back. Per ChatGPT, AI is not intelligent as it lacks consciousness. I posited that AI is advanced software weighted decision trees, with some adaptability on weights hidden behind a very good language model. ChatGPT response: “Spot on.” But will they learn them on their own, or only when “trained”? The former is intelligence, the latter, not. Seems to me that trump can save the country a half trillion and just download the free Deepseek apt from the apple apt store. So what’s the big deal about this Chinese super AI? “built at a lower cost and with less computing resources than what larger tech firms typically need for LLM development.” OK, so it’s cheaper and uses less computer resources- why does that make it a superior AI? If the hype is true, an AI of equal capability (not superior) but at significantly lower cost is economically superior. Keep in mind that if AI needs a lot more juice then we are talking about 2040 at the earliest just to get started. Nobody’s share price today depends on that. In their last episode, the two non-Chinese dudes who put out “The China Show” reported on the results of two questions put to one of the Chinese AI’s (Deepseek) … one was ‘Does Donald Trump exist?‘ and the other was ‘Does Xi Jinping exist?‘ The answer to the DJT question was a simple “yes”, however the answer for the Xi Jinping question was “Sorry, that’s beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something else.” OH YEAH – China’s AI holds great promise . /SARC (if you didn’t catch that) Here’s the segment, cued up: https://youtu.be/bZciXwVsYQk?t=2563 In otherwords, “I am not programmed to respond in that area.” — Star Trek, I Mudd Just in, over the transom: U.S. Navy Bans DeepSeek Over ‘Security Concerns’ As ‘Substantial’ Evidence Emerges Chinese AI Ripped Off ChatGPT https://www.zerohedge.com/ai/us-navy-bans-deepseek-over-security-concerns-substantial-evidence-emerges-chinese-ai-ripped A couple of excerpts: The U.S. Navy has instructed service members to avoid using the Chinese AI platform DeepSeek, citing “potential security and ethical concerns,” The U.S. Navy has instructed service members to avoid using the Chinese AI platform DeepSeek, citing “potential security and ethical concerns,” and The warning follows the recent rise of DeepSeek’s R1 model, which has garnered significant attention worldwide, particularly within the U.S. business and technology sectors. The R1 model has demonstrated capabilities comparable to OpenAI’s models. In December, DeepSeek claimed it had successfully trained a large language model in just two months at a cost of $6 million—a figure disputed by technologists—despite U.S. restrictions on semiconductor chip exports to China. The Navy learned the lessons of the Trojan War. I wonder what Deepseek thinks about a climate crisis caused by CO2? What do Deepseek’s programmers want it to say about CO2? What’s the Chicom line? Ask and let us know. I don’t think I’m going to download the app. Being from the Chicoms, it might compromise my phone. I asked it and it simply regurgitated the standard line. Nothing new and the old BS about ocean acidification was there unchanged. I will stick to Grok for now. I’m waiting on some hands on testing to see what this package really does. Is it an entry level AI platform or a robust system ready to solve world problems. I did a test on DEEPSEEK to determine the LCOE of battery firmed wind in Australia. I asked for average cost for installation. This was the answer after detailed calculations: The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for the lithium battery-firmed wind farm is approximately AUD 1,356/MWh. This high cost is primarily driven by the large battery storage requirement for 2-week wind droughts and the low wind capacity factor. The full answer is more comprehensive than Perplexity and includes O&M costs without specifically requesting them. Perplexity does not include O&M unless you ask for them. Not a bad estimate either, using Li-ion battery backup. Backup, no matter how you do it, triples the cost of wind-PV. Just heard this morning that the CHINESE DeepSeek records your your key strokes. It’s in the terms and conditions. Don’t use it. No surprise. Plot twist: DeepSeek is a DeepFake along the lines of Theranos. Theranos actually used industry standard blood work analysis equipment behind the scenes to analyze blood samples taken from patients, unknown to the patients or those being shown Theranos-built equipment that was SUPPOSED TO BE being used to make the blood analysis runs. To wit, with DeepSeek there is a back-end to DeepSeek that uses a panel, nay, a room full of generalists in a say a half dozen technical areas and ALL DeepSeek is, is really a per-processor for A) a more general search (Google?) engine AND B) kinda in parallel the questions, queries routed to the ‘room’ of subject matter experts/technical generalists … maybe the DeepSeek answers/searches get reviewed, or modified by a panel on a go/no go way … point being, this is one big show and fake as all get out, ala, Theranos (IF you know the full story there.) The Theranos story is apt. Claim was could do same blood chemistry analysis with a finger prick drop that otherwise took a full tube blood draw. The problem always was that never made any known analytic chemistry sense—you need a certain volume to get added reagents to produce a definitive result. Theranos was finally proven a giant scam. Could be the same here. Same ‘IQ’ from much more limited data training set simply does not logically compute, exactly analogous to Theranos. Do not accept the hype. Try the various AIs for yourself. Ask hard questions to which you know the answer, and you will learn a lot about how much the programmers know and what is IN the data base and what is not. It is not exciting, at least not yet, no matter the huge investments our not too bright oligarchs are making. My students seem to like AI’s editing capability most. Non- native English speakers benefit from AI, BUT AI is very wordy. It does not know about Samuel Clemens. If students use it without editing, it is easy to recognize the source. Fun new technical possibility just showed up this evening. It is possible that DeepSeek R1 was reverse engineered by ‘training’ on equivalent ChatGPT o1. The newly coined word for this possibility is ‘reverse engineering’—of course also illegal intellectual theft for which China is famous. We have a way to go for clarity. But China claims to have used markedly fewer resources to achieve what they announced. On that basis, it is not a lace of resources in the US, it is lack of a different approach.

Most U.S. semiconductor ETFs focus on the same 30 semiconductor stocks, varying primarily in their ... [+] weighting methodologies. Semiconductor stocks outpaced the S&P 500 in 2024. The momentum will likely continue as global AI infrastructure spending keeps those chipmakers busy. The recently announced Stargate project funded by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX is an example. Stargate is slated to pour $500 billion into AI data centers over the next four years. Despite China's recent announcement about its DeepSeek technology, semiconductor stocks still have bright futures. A diversified semiconductor ETF is a smart choice if you are new to this space. Below, you will meet six high-performing semiconductor funds—one of which could fit nicely in your ETF portfolio. The universe of semiconductor ETFs is small. There are about two dozen of them in total. The list shrinks to about 10 when you exclude leveraged and inverse funds. Leverage funds use debt to amplify returns, but this also increases risk. Inverse funds produce the opposite return of an underlying index. So, if a semiconductor index rises 10%, the inverse ETF would lose 10%. Because leveraged and inverse funds are too risky for most investors, they are excluded from this list. The 10 remaining funds were sorted on their one-year total returns. Total return includes appreciation and dividends. None are dividend ETFs per se, but they do pay small yields. The list of 10 was then trimmed to the top six semiconductor ETFs, ordered from highest to lowest return. The table below introduces six semiconductor ETFs with total one-year returns ranging from 11.89% to 39.69%. Read on for an overview of each semiconductor fund. Metrics are current as of January 27 after close of trading. For more investing ideas, see best ETFs for 2025 and income investing ETFs. SMH tracks the results of the MVIS U.S. Listed Semiconductor Index. The index and the fund include the 25 largest U.S. exchange-traded stocks that generate 50% or more of their revenues from semiconductors. The stocks are market-cap-weighted with a maximum weighting of 20%. VanEck's semiconductor ETF is the only pick on this list tracking the MVIS domestic semiconductor index. It is also the only fund that returned more than 30% to its shareholders over the last year. The secret is the aggressive weighting of Nvidia (NVDA) at 19.19% and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) at 12.96%. This one-two punch of semiconductor stocks has delivered huge gains over the past year, but the combination is risky. Nvidia is TSM's second-largest customer, so the companies' futures are linked. This ETF bets heavily that Nvidia and, by association, TSM will continue monetizing the AI buildout. If Nvidia stumbles, you might regret the fund's high concentration of those two stocks. The Columbia ETF is an actively managed fund that invests in semiconductor companies with promising, long-term growth potential. Selection factors include the quality of the management team and intellectual property. Stocks in the portfolio are weighted by conviction—so the highest-potential securities, as determined by fund manager analysis, are held in the largest quantities. The stocks in the SEMI portfolio are picked by humans who continually research and analyze the semiconductor space. Other ETFs on this list use an index to define their holdings. The human component creates the potential to beat index performance. The trade-off is a higher expense ratio since actively managed funds are more expensive to operate. Nvidia and Broadcom are the two largest holdings. Combined, they account for more than 40% of this fund's portfolio. To date, SEMI's returns have been competitive but not segment-leading. Strive's semiconductor ETF tracks the Bloomberg U.S. Listed Semiconductors Select Total Return Index. The index and fund include the top 30 semiconductor stocks weighted with a modified market cap formula. The maximum weighting is 22.5% and the cumulative weight of stocks comprising more than 4.5% of the index is capped at 45%. Strive's fund was launched in October 2022, making it the youngest fund on this list. It has the highest average annual return since inception, partially due to good timing. The fund launched just as tech stocks started rebounding from a tough 2022. SHOC has benefited from high concentrations in Nvidia and Broadcom. The fund currently holds these stocks at 20.02% and 17.57%, respectively. ASML Holding NV (ASML) is also a top holding at 8.98%. The remaining positions are weighted at 4.5% or lower. The SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF tracks an index of semiconductor stocks in the S&P Total Market Index. As of January 2025, there are 41 companies in the index and the fund, and individual weightings are capped at 4.5%. The SPDR semiconductor fund includes large, mid and small cap stocks using a modified equal-weighting system. With a larger portfolio and an exposure limit of 4.5% on any one security, XSD is the most balanced of the funds on this list. Broadcom is the largest holding at 3.93%, while Nvidia is the 12th largest position at 3.01%. This fund is a nice choice for investors who want diversified exposure to smaller semiconductor stocks such as Diodes Incorporated (DIOD) and Ambarella (AMBA). Invesco's original semiconductor ETF, PSI, tracks the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex℠ Index. Intellidex indexes identify companies with high capital gains potential by analyzing price and earnings momentum, quality, management and value. The index and fund use a modified equal-weighting system so individual stock exposures have a limited range of 1.74% to 6.47%. PSI's modified equal-weighting system reduces over-concentration risk in mega-tech stocks Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO). Broadcom is the fund's top holding, weighted at 6.73%, and Nvidia is number five, weighted at 4.76%. This weighting system removes Nvidia's dominance and allows smaller companies more influence over the group's performance. PSI has delivered solid growth in the past year, without relying on one or two tickers. This fund is a good choice for investors wanting more balanced exposure to the semiconductor space. PHLX is Invesco's newer semiconductor ETF, launched in 2021. The fund tracks the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, which includes the largest, U.S.-listed 30 semiconductor stocks. The stocks are weighted by market capitalization with some limitations. For example, the top three positions cannot exceed 12%, 10% and 8%, respectively. SOXQ has the lowest expense ratio and the second-highest dividend yield among the ETFs here. The fund's weighting system moderates over-concentration risk while allowing the big players some room to carry the portfolio's performance. SOXQ also includes 4.45% exposure to Taiwan Semiconductor, which is left out of several other funds. Most U.S. semiconductor ETFs focus on the same 30 semiconductor stocks, varying primarily in their weighting methodologies. Market-weighted funds depend on the biggest companies, while equal-weighted funds capture more growth from smaller companies. Your risk tolerance and investing philosophy can reveal which strategy suits you best. Do you believe in letting growth stocks run? If yes, then choose a market-weighted fund. If you worry that ever-rising stock prices may ultimately retreat, opt for equal weighting. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Nvidia faces a reckoning as Chinese upstart raises questions about Wall Street's darling

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. NEW YORK (AP) — The superstar run for Nvidia’s stock the last few years has been astonishing. So was its tumble Monday, which caused $595 billion in wealth to vanish. That’s about as much as PepsiCo, McDonalds, Starbucks and Target are worth, combined. Mostly known only in gaming and crypto circles a few years ago, Nvidia burst into the zeitgeist after seeing its sales surge because customers wanted its chips to train their chatbots and other artificial intelligence products. Nvidia became a household name as its stock more than tripled in 2023 and then more than doubled in 2024. Investors and analysts lauded CEO Jensen Huang as the “Godfather of AI.” Nvidia grew into a $3 trillion-plus behemoth and traded places with titans like Apple to become the most valuable company on Wall Street. But that all came to a screeching halt Monday, at least for a moment, after a Chinese upstart called DeepSeek said it had developed a large-language model that could perform like ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, but by using far less computing power. Here’s a look at how it all got to this point: How did it become a market darling? Nvidia’s roots began in gaming. The Santa Clara, California-based tech company’s invention of the graphics processor unit, or GPU, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. Now Nvidia’s specialized chips are key components that help power different forms of artificial intelligence, including the latest generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. Huang has dubbed AI “the next industrial revolution,” and Nvidia’s GPUs are designed to perform artificial intelligence tasks faster and more efficiently than general-purpose chips like CPUs. Tech giants are snapping up Nvidia chips as they wade deeper into AI — a movement that’s enabling cars to drive by themselves, and generating stories, art and music. The demand helped Nvidia's revenue grow by eye-popping levels, quarter after quarter. On Feb. 23, 2023, after Nvidia breezed past analysts' expectations for quarterly profit, Huang said that “AI is at an inflection point, setting up for broad adoption reaching into every industry.” The company's quarterly revenue at the time was $6.05 billion. That ramped up to $7.19 billion just three months later and then nearly doubled to $13.51 billion three months after that. Revenue has since vaulted to $35.08 billion in the three months through October 2024. The company's stock price has similarly soared, and its total market value quickly passed rivals like Intel, Microsoft and others. Nvidia alone accounted for more than a fifth of all of the S&P 500 index's total return last year. No other stock came close, and it had more than triple Apple's impact. Buy an S&P 500 index fund today, and nearly 6 cents out of every $1 will go only into Nvidia. That leaves 94 cents for all the other 499 companies. Is it still a darling? Unlike the dot-com boom, real money was behind Nvidia’s surge, and its stock price rose on expectations of ever more to come. Those expectations came into question on Monday. DeepSeek and its seemingly lower-cost operations raised worries about whether companies would need to spend as many dollars on Nvidia chips as previously thought. The concerns dragged down stocks across the AI industry, including suppliers to the chip industry and the power companies hoping to electrify the vast data centers that were expected to get built to run those chips. But Nvidia was in the spotlight because its stock has become the brightest symbol of the AI bonanza. Some on Wall Street saw Monday's nearly 17% plunge for Nvidia's stock as an opportunity rather than a signal of pending doom, saying the stock became more affordable. If AI does become cheaper to run, it could open the door to new kinds of customers and software innovations that could ultimately help the industry in the long term. “As for Nvidia itself, this isn’t the first time a major tech stock has faced existential questions,” said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. “We’ve seen similar situations with Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, and Netflix — companies that were once doubted but ultimately rebounded.” DeepSeek's entrance certainly adds uncertainty to the entire AI ecosystem, but it doesn't change the overwhelming momentum behind the movement, according to Brian Colello, strategist at Morningstar. “We believe that AI GPU demand still exceeds supply,” he wrote in a report. "So, while slimmer models may enable greater development for the same number of chips, we still think tech firms will continue to buy all the GPUs they can as part of this AI 'gold rush.'" For its part, Nvidia's stock wobbled between gains and losses early Tuesday following its worst plunge since the 2020 COVID crash, and then rallied a bit and ended the day nearly 9% higher.

Title: DeepSeek Is Causing Stock Market Panic. Here's Why It Matters.

Senior Reporter, Work/Life If you follow the stock market, then you know all about the bogeyman scaring Wall Street right now: DeepSeek. The Chinese ChatGPT competitor is currently the top-downloaded productivity app in the U.S. Apple app store. DeepSeek’s newest open-source model, R1, was released last week, and it is wowing the AI industry because it reportedly has advanced capabilities for a fraction of the price ― and without needing the same energy ― as U.S. companies like OpenAI and Google. On Monday, Nvidia ― which largely makes the highly specialized, expensive chips that are powering the U.S. AI boom ― saw its shares plunge 17% in response to the news about DeepSeek’s AI model, causing the company to lose almost $600 billion in market value. It was the biggest one-day loss ever for a public company. Other AI-related stocks, including Broadcom, also saw their stocks slump by over 10% yesterday. In other words, a huge sell-off of stock just happened. This drop reflects “a sharp pullback in price because of an abundance of sellers,” explained Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. “Stock prices are a reflection of future corporate earnings expectations. Anything that changes the assumptions in those earnings expectations can lead to a sharp correction in price,” he said. “In technology, the ever-present risk is that a competitor will come along with a better, cheaper or more efficient mousetrap and pose a threat to future earnings. When this happens, investors tend to sell first and ask questions later.” Many investors are clearly panicking and making bets on the future of AI, but should you? HuffPost asked financial experts about what, if anything, you should be doing with your money ― regardless of what you have invested. Some people are wondering if the sell-off of Nvidia (NVDA) stock makes it actually a good time to buy Nvidia stock, but financial experts advise against making any sudden changes. “You should never respond to one-off changes in the stock market, and you should not be investing in individual stocks or worried about the changes in individual stocks,” warned University of Houston economist Dietrich Vollrath. “You should, as always, be invested in broad index funds with the lowest possible expense ratios.“ It’s easy to get swept up in the success stories of individual stocks paying off loans or houses, but here are some sobering facts: Only about 1% of investors are successful at timing the stock market. Remember GameStop’s quick rise and fall? YouTuber David Dobrik said he lost $85,000 investing in GameStop during its short-lived hype. Ideally, you should diversify your investments so one stock’s financial losses do not crater or compound your own. “Investors should aim at having a diversified portfolio and are usually better off not trying to time the market,” Gil Luria, head of technology research for financial services firm D.A. Davidson, said Tuesday. “NVDA shares declined yesterday because there are new concerns regarding their ability to continue to grow at the same rate as the last couple of years.” And if you did invest solely in AI chip makers, use this stinging loss as your sign to spread your money around. “Yesterday’s market moves also underscore the risks of being too heavily concentrated in a narrow sector of the market,” McBride said. “If you have too much of your wealth tied up in a handful of closely related stocks, it serves as a wake-up call to spread the money out and cushion against a sudden downdraft.” Before you invest your housing payment in risky stocks, follow this basic financial advice: Make sure you have money set aside in your emergency savings, which ideally is three to six months of after-tax living expenses, so you always have money to fall back on. And do make clear financial goals, such as saving for retirement, so that your investment decisions are aligned with your risk appetite. Although AI chip makers had a bad day Monday on Wall Street, they are already beginning to bounce back a day later. Instead of being reactive to the stock market going up or down a lot in one day, look at the big picture. “Looking at trends over several years provides a more accurate picture, as markets can experience significant volatility within a single year. Over time, markets have a way of balancing out,” said Ramona Ortega, CEO and founder of WealthBuild, an AI-powered financial assistant. “There’s no exact timeline for when corrections will occur, but history shows they always do.” Vollrath said what happened to Nvidia is a “reminder that the economy is not the stock market. This means essentially nothing for the economy, in terms of economic growth, interest rates or employment.“ Is Monday’s chip-maker sell-off an overreaction, or is DeepSeek’s low-cost breakthrough a fundamental shift to where the AI market is heading? It’s too soon to tell whether this will have larger repercussions for AI jobs and consumer spending, experts say. The next four years will change America forever.

You and I will forget about this in a week.”

Title: The Biggest Winner In The DeepSeek Disruption Story Is Open Source AI

When the news about DeepSeek-R1 broke, the AI world was quick to frame it as yet another flashpoint ... [+] in the ongoing U.S.-China AI rivalry. But the real story, according to experts like Yann LeCun, is about the value of open source AI. (Photo by NICOLAS TUCAT/AFP via Getty Images) DeepSeek-R1 — the AI model created by DeepSeek, a little known Chinese company, at a fraction of what it cost OpenAI to build its own models — has sent the AI industry into a frenzy for the last couple of days. When the news about DeepSeek-R1 broke, the AI world was quick to frame it as yet another flashpoint in the ongoing U.S.-China AI rivalry. However, I argue that the real story isn’t about geopolitics, although there’s a strong geopolitical layer somewhere there. I believe that the real story is about the growing power of open-source AI and how it’s upending the traditional dominance of closed-source models — a line of thought that Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, also shares. LeCun, a vocal proponent of open-source AI, recently wrote in a LinkedIn post: “To people who see the performance of DeepSeek and think: ‘China is surpassing the U.S. in AI.’ You are reading this wrong. The correct reading is: ‘Open-source models are surpassing proprietary ones.’” While LeCun’s argument may seem simple, its message is far weightier than it appears on the surface: DeepSeek-R1 didn’t emerge from a vacuum. It built on the foundations of open-source research, leveraging previous advancements like Meta’s Llama models and the PyTorch ecosystem. DeepSeek’s remarkable success with its new AI model reinforces the notion that open-source AI is becoming more competitive with, and perhaps even surpassing, the closed, proprietary models of major technology firms. Open-source AI, according to the Open Source Initiative, is “an AI system made available under terms and in a way that grants the freedom to use the system for any purpose and without having to ask for permission, study how the system works and inspect its components, modify the system for any purpose, including to change its output, share the system for others to use with or without modifications, for any purpose.” The gist of all that jargon is that open-source AI models give you the freedom to modify and build whatever you want. It’s like having free, unrestricted access to all-purpose flour if you were a baker. Imagine the wide range of things you could bake. Closed source AI, on the other hand, means just the exact opposite. In closed AI models, the source codes and underlying algorithms are kept private and cannot be modified or built upon. The major argument for this type of approach is privacy. By keeping AI models closed, proponents of this approach say they can better protect users against data privacy breaches and potential misuse of the technology. But according to Manu Sharma, cofounder and CEO of Labelbox, “innovations in software are very hard to keep closed-source in today’s world. Almost every foundational piece of technology in AI is open source and has gained large mindshare.” Sharma believes we are witnessing the same trend in AI that we saw with databases and operating systems, where open solutions eventually dominated the industry. With proprietary models requiring massive investment in compute and data acquisition, open-source alternatives offer more attractive options to companies seeking cost-effective AI solutions. DeepSeek-R1’s training cost — reportedly just $6 million — has shocked industry insiders, especially when compared to the billions spent by OpenAI, Google and Anthropic on their frontier models. Kevin Surace, CEO of Appvance, called it a “wake-up call,” proving that “China has focused on low-cost rapid models while the U.S. has focused on huge models at a huge cost.” DeepSeek’s AI model undoubtedly raises a valid question about whether we are on the cusp of an AI price war. Even Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, acknowledged in a tweet late yesterday that “DeepSeek’s R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price.” Andy Thurai, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research, noted in his Weekly Tech Bytes newsletter on LinkedIn that DeepSeek’s efficiency will inevitably put downward pressure on AI costs. “If it is proven that the entire AI software supply chain can be done cheaply using open-source software, many startups will take a hit. VCs will stop writing blank checks to start-ups that have generative AI on their pitch deck.” Venture-backed AI firms that rely on closed-source models to justify their high valuations could take a devastating hit in the aftermath of the DeepSeek tsunami. Companies that fail to differentiate themselves beyond the mere ability to train LLMs could face significant funding challenges. However, not everyone is enthusiastic about open-source AI taking center stage. Indeed, open-source models democratize AI access, but they also introduce concerns about security, misuse and privacy. Surace raised concerns about DeepSeek’s origins, noting that “privacy is an issue because it’s China. It’s always about collecting data from users. So users beware.” While DeepSeek’s model weights and codes are open, its training data sources remain largely opaque, making it difficult to assess potential biases or security risks. Syed Hussain and Neil Benedict, cofounders of Shiza.ai, expressed significant concerns about both the technical claims and potential security implications of DeepSeek. Both Hussain and Benedict viewed DeepSeek not as merely a company competing in the market, but as potentially part of a broader Chinese state strategy that might be aimed at disrupting the U.S. AI industry and market confidence. While people also worry about U.S. companies having access to their data, those companies are bound by U.S. privacy laws and constitutional protections, said Benedict. In contrast, he argued that “DeepSeek, potentially tied to the Chinese state, operates under different rules and motivations.” While he admitted that many U.S. companies also have profit-driven motivations for data collection, he said DeepSeek’s free model raises questions about hidden incentives. Hussain further described DeepSeek as “a potential Trojan horse,” suggesting that “it could be a sophisticated data collection operation masked as a competitive AI product.” However, Thurai emphasized the transparency problem in AI models, regardless of origin. “When choosing a model, transparency, the model creation process, and auditability should be more important than just the cost of usage,” he said. While DeepSeek-R1 is open-source, many companies may hesitate to adopt it without clearer disclosures about its dataset and safety mechanisms. The financial markets have already reacted to DeepSeek’s impact. Although Nvidia’s stock has slightly rebounded by 6%, it faced short-term volatility, reflecting concerns that cheaper AI models will reduce demand for the company’s high-end GPUs. But Sharma remains bullish on Nvidia’s long-term prospects. “Affordable and abundant AGI means many more people are going to use it faster, and use it everywhere. Compute demand around inference will soar,” he told me. This suggests that while training costs may decline, the demand for AI inference — running models efficiently at scale — will continue to grow. Companies like Nvidia may pivot toward optimizing hardware for inference workloads rather than focusing solely on the next wave of ultra-large training clusters. If DeepSeek-R1 has proven anything, it’s that high-performance open-source models are here to stay — and they may become the dominant force in AI development. As LeCun noted, “DeepSeek has profited from open research and open source (e.g. PyTorch and Llama from Meta). Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it. That is the power of open research and open source.” Businesses now need to rethink their reliance on closed-source models and consider the benefits of contributing to — and benefiting from — an open AI ecosystem. Moving forward, the debate won’t just be about an “AI Cold War” between the U.S. and China, but about whether the future of AI will be more open, accessible and shared or closed, proprietary and expensive. The genie is out of the bottle, though. And it looks like it’s open-source. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.54%) announced today that its blockbuster drug Ozempic was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first GLP-1 treatment for chronic kidney disease among people with type 2 diabetes. The popular diabetes drug can now be used to reduce the risk of kidney disease worsening, kidney failure, and death due to heart disease in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. This is latest in a series of FDA-approved uses of GLP-1 drugs, which have become popular for weight loss as well as for conditions associated with diabetes, like sleep apnea. “Chronic kidney disease is very serious and common in patients living with type 2 diabetes and represents a critical need for adults living with these comorbidities,” said Anna Windle, a senior vice president at Novo Nordisk, in a press release. The approval was based on a late-stage clinical trial, which found that a weekly, one-milligram injection of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and the weigh- loss drug Wegovy, was found to reduce the combined risk of major kidney complications (including kidney failure), cardiovascular events, and even death from any cause by 24% in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Novo Nordisk ended the trial early in 2023 after an independent monitoring committee determined that Ozempic’s efficacy in treating chronic kidney disease was clear. The trial followed 3,533 people with kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, half of whom took semaglutide while the other half was given a placebo, for more than three years. Chronic kidney disease is a condition in which the kidney can’t filter blood properly. It affects more than 35.5 million U.S. adults, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 40% of people with type 2 diabeetes also experience chronic kidney disease, according to Novo Nordisk. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Why DeepSeek’s cost-efficient R1 spooked Nvidia investors, according to a strategist

Viraj “Raj” Patel, Head of Asset Allocation at Fiduciary Trust International, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Could DeepSeek’s rise signal increased global competition for Nvidia? And how should investors react? VP: We think that the announcement at DeepSeek over the weekend was certainly a wake up or an aha moment for AI. I think for a while a lot of investors were thinking that the US is the only game for AI. And this was obviously not just a breakthrough, but I think DeepSeek also told us that they can build AI models that could compete with the US at a much lower cost. So I think what spooked markets yesterday was not necessarily the development of an AI model by DeepSeek. I think the idea was always that while the U.S. had a lead, it was foolish to think that they would be the only game in town. I think the massive step function down in cost so soon spooked AI investors versus what you would expect on a technology to have more of a smoother glide path at early stages of implementation. So I think for the hyperscalers and AI companies that are spending hundreds of billions of dollars, I think this is maybe a little bit of a wake up call in terms of this is productive capital and productive investment behind a technology that is largely going to be transformative. But the new question in markets after DeepSeek’s announcement on what they’ve been able to accomplish at the cost they’ve been able to do that is is the return on investment that a lot of these Mag 7 hyperscalers and AI companies are throwing behind in CapEx and investment going to yield a sufficient return on investment? Our answer is yes. We wouldn’t extrapolate one day of market activity into a long-term thesis or just one announcement over the weekend on an AI competitor, but we think that this is a real technology that should have productive benefits to society in the intermediate to long term. But in the short-term here, lots to unpack in terms of investment, what the existing assumptions were regarding what it takes to build and train AI models may have been upended a little bit, but again, we are acutely focused on earnings this week where a lot of AI or hyperscalers are reporting earnings in the technology and Mag 7 space and it’ll be interesting to see what they have to say. AM: And Nvidia (NVDA) has said that DeepSeek-R1 actually is good, that it will mean that eventually they’ll have to buy more Nvidia chips. And the assumption is that Nvidia chips maybe are even being used secretly in this R1. Do you believe Nvidia when they say that? VP: Lots to unpack. As I said, I think early indications from AI experts are questioning whether the technology they have built at the cost they built it at could be built with Nvidia’s newest hardware, which is leading others to believe that okay, they might have built this technology or this AI model with older Nvidia chips, which you can use then to circumvent some of the export controls on chips that the US has in place. But again, I think a lot more is to be learned in the coming days and weeks in terms of just how they built this on the timescale they have, the cost they have and on the hardware they have. So if they build something circumventing some of the export controls on chips, they’re probably not likely to be transparent about it. But as more details come out and just how efficient and comparable these AI models are, or language learning models to some of the US counterparts which are using best-in-class chips and hardware will come to light over the coming days and weeks and see if they can really kind of compete on an apples to apples basis. AM: The DeepSeek news was a shock to investors. Are there sectors or opportunities you see elsewhere in the market where they should consider investing? VP: Yeah, we think if you think about the Mag 7 AI or technology trade, which has done really well and as you mentioned earlier, looking for places to rotate in the markets, i.e. areas that have done really well, Mag 7 and technology, and now we are facing four years of a new administration under President Trump. They are natural beneficiaries in other sectors like financials for example. We have a regime in place that is pro-business, pro-markets, wants decreased regulations. We should see increased activity in capital markets, increased activity by the investment banks, likely more IPO activity. These are natural secular tailwinds for financials. We think given the deregulation mantra that President Trump and his administration is talking about, we think there’s opportunities in cyclical areas like energy materials, industrials, especially if he’s thinking seriously about implementing some of his protectionist policies about making more at home, manufacturing at home and really boosting manufacturing inside of the us. Those areas should be natural beneficiaries as well. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: DeepSeek is going to be the biggest topic in tech earnings this week, analysts say

DeepSeek just made this earnings season a lot more interesting. A slew of Big Tech names are due to report this week and next. Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft take center stage on January 29, with Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon hot on their heels. Investors were already scrutinizing the companies, which have been spending multiple billions of dollars on building AI models and infrastructure, for signs about whether the outlay on staff, chips, and data centers is delivering returns. Now DeepSeek has made justifying that spending to investors and analysts a lot trickier for execs, PR, and IR. "I expect pretty much everyone to get questions on it," Morningstar analyst William Kerwin said. DeepSeek's new AI model, R1, shook the tech industry this week, wiping more than $1 trillion off US stocks in market cap in one day. It offers a model that seems similarly effective to ones made by US companies. Moreover, the Chinese company said it cost less than $6 million to train. In comparison, Meta has said it plans to invest over $60 billion in AI infrastructure in 2025. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion partnership involving OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to build AI infrastructure in the US. Markets stabilized a little by Tuesday, but the panic shows how DeepSeek's impact will be top of mind during earnings calls, analysts told Business Insider. Investors will want to know if R1 changes companies' views on future infrastructure spending, Kerwin said. That could "temper the demand" for chips from Nvidia, Forrester analysts said in a Tuesday note. Tech companies like Meta and Elon Musk's xAI have been buying and using hundreds of thousands of specialist Nvidia chips for their AI models, helping its stock price rocket. Monday's tech rout already wiped about 17% off Nvidia's market cap. However, having access to cheaper models could pay off in the longer term because of "creation opportunities for many, many more startups and enterprises alike, thereby increasing demand," per Forrester. Apple, which reports after the bell on Thursday, stands to gain from a decline in cost for AI training. The iPhone maker took a lower-cost AI strategy than competitors, and it would benefit from integrating cost-effective training for Apple Intelligence, analysts told BI. Although Apple's stock gained on Monday, CEO Tim Cook should still expect DeepSeek chatter, analysts said. Nvidia won't report earnings until February 26, yet will likely still have to answer DeepSeek questions. And across the board, "Beyond cost concerns, tech leaders will need to address whether this signals a need to shift toward more efficient AI development approaches that could reshape strategic planning," Jacob Bourne, analyst at BI sister company EMARKETER, said.

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company.

DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 rebounded on Tuesday, following a steep stock sell-off spurred by Chinese startup DeepSeek and the ripple effect its potentially cheaper AI model could have on Big Tech. Bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) was the standout of the trading day, with shares finishing the day up nearly 9% after it shaved off a record $589 billion from its market cap in the previous session. Aided by Nvidia's gains, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) surged over 2%, coming off a closing loss of more than 3%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained roughly 0.3%. Notably, the tech sector notched its biggest two-day reversal in over two years after it notched its worst day since March 2020 on Monday. Stocks began to chip away at losses booked in Monday's tech-led rout, which came as buzz built for DeepSeek's potentially cheaper AI model. That risk to US leadership in AI raised questions about whether chipmakers and other tech names can follow through on high earnings expectations. With the DeepSeek risk in mind, focus is tighter on Big Tech earnings coming this week, with results from Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) on the docket. Investors also assessed a tougher tone on tariffs from President Donald Trump as markets look ahead to the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on Wednesday where the impact of his policies will likely be discussed. The central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, given recent solid economic readings. The dollar (DX=F) strengthened after renewed tariff threats from Trump that revived worries about a trade war, already in focus after a brief standoff with Colombia. Trump said he wants universal tariffs "much bigger" than the 2.5% his incoming Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, reportedly plans to introduce gradually. Starbucks (SBUX) stock rose over 4% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the coffee giant reported earnings that beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Same-store sales declined for the fourth consecutive quarter as the company looks to continue its recent turnaround plan. “While we have room for improvement, we’re making progress as planned, and have confidence we’re on the right track,” Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said in a video released Tuesday afternoon. The company’s same-store sales, a key metric for restaurant chains, fell 4% year over year in the reported quarter, with traffic to its stores declining by 6%. Wall Street had expected same-store sales and foot traffic to decline by 5.30% and 7.28%, respectively, year over year. Outside of domestic markets, same-store sales also declined 4%, while sales in China — the company's second-largest market — fell by 6%. Stocks closed in the green on Tuesday as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rebounded from Monday's steep sell-off spurred by Chinese startup DeepSeek and its potentially cheaper AI model. Bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) finished the day up nearly 9% after it shaved off a record $589 billion from its market cap on Monday. Aided by Nvidia's gains, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) surged over 2%, coming off a closing loss of more than 3%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained roughly 0.3%. The fourth volume of Yahoo Finance's Chartbook, released on Tuesday, tells the story of markets and economy through 44 charts. And given that we ask a broad question about what the most important chart is for investors right now, there's sometimes a takeaway in what respondents don't send. After the past several versions of this book included many charts making the case for interest rate cuts, there was little discussion of further easing from the Federal Reserve throughout our latest collection of charts. Dynamic Economic Strategy CEO John Silvia's submission helps explain why. Silvia pointed out that at 4.1%, the unemployment rate is hovering near where the Fed expects it to end this year, while private payroll growth has come off the boil. To Silvia, this shows a labor market that may be normalizing right in the area the Fed would like it to stay. This, Silvia said, provides "less room for the Fed to ease as job/economic growth continues to move ahead and long-run full employment is on the horizon." With inflation relatively sticky and the labor market holding up OK, many economists right now seem more interested in Trump's policies. Specifically the focus centers around how tariffs could impact inflation, and therefore Fed policy, before making further conclusions on the path forward for interest rates. Check out the full Yahoo Finance Chartbook here. Some breaking news that's not related to DeepSeek or Wall Street's AI trades: The Container Store has emerged from bankruptcy. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma has the latest: The struggling home goods store emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Tuesday, Yahoo Finance learned exclusively. In a release, the company said it "achieved the objectives it set for this process" in late December. That includes refinancing its short-term debt, reducing "previous long-term debt obligations," gaining access to $40 million in new money financing, and "modifying its asset-backed lending facility to add $40 million in upsized capacity." Throughout the process, the business operated as usual across stores, online, and in-home services. It was also able to "[meet] its obligations to vendors, employees and customers." No employees were let go, but the company did close down two stores since the bankruptcy filing. The closings were separate from the bankruptcy process. Formerly under the ticker TCSG, the company is now private after the restructuring process. For the quarter ended Sept. 28, 2024, the Container Store listed total liabilities of $836.4 million against $969 million in total assets. Read more here. Nvidia (NVDA) rose as much as 7% Tuesday afternoon as tech stocks rebounded from a sharp sell-off. The AI chip giant bounced back from its 17% drop on Monday sparked by investor anxiety related to a new AI model recently launched by Chinese startup DeepSeek. The artificial intelligence assistant, seen as more efficient and less expensive than its American-made rivals, spooked investor sentiment over AI dominance in the US and raised questions about valuations and spending. AI-exposed power stocks attempted a rebound on Tuesday after getting crushed in the tech rout prompted by fears that energy demand for the artificial intelligence boom may be ahead of its skies. Constellation Energy (CEG), the largest nuclear plant operator in the US was relatively flat after tumbling 21% during the prior session. Electricity generator Vistra Corp (VST) rose more than 4% after sinking by a record 28%. Power equipment maker and servicer GE Vernova (GEV) also gained 2%, retracing a fraction of its one-day 21% drop. AI-exposed energy stocks were recovering from a beating on Monday after Chinese startup DeepSeek released a new AI model viewed as more competitive and energy-efficient compared to its US rivals. The sell-off rattled investors given the optimism over electricity needs to power the booming AI data center industry. Power stocks are coming off a ripping rally in 2024 and start of the year. Paul Zimbardo, managing director for US power utilities & clean energy research at Jeffrries, said data center deployment is "very likely intact" in the medium term as the race remains "on." The question going forward is what happens in the later part of the decade and 2030s. "Does that trend accelerate in the future? Does it kind of stabilize and even see some moderation of demand growth out later in the decade?" asked the analyst. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: New mixed messages this week about President Donald Trump's implementation of tariffs are flummoxing markets and businesses hoping for quick clarity on the 2.0 version of Trump's trade policy. The main point of confusion is that public signals from Trump’s orbit often appear at odds with Trump himself. The sometimes contradictory back and forth — a feature of the debate around tariffs since Trump's win — is taking on an outsized importance with the approach of Trump’s self-imposed Feb. 1 deadline, whe he has promised to install 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% duties on China. Read more here. OpenAI on Tuesday announced a new tailored version of ChatGPT designed for US government agencies, a product launch that comes as the industry is still reeling from the breakout of a cost-efficient Chinese AI startup and as President Trump has urged tech companies to stay ahead of the competition. OpenAI says the new service, ChatGPT Gov, is meant to streamline the government's access to its models and it will give staffers the ability to better manage their own security and compliance as agencies handle sensitive data. "By making our products available to the U.S. government, we aim to ensure AI serves the national interest and the public good, aligned with democratic values, while empowering policymakers to responsibly integrate these capabilities to deliver better services to the American people," the company said in a statement unveiling the new tool. Read more about ChatGPT Gov's product launch here. Tech stocks led the major averages higher on Tuesday with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gaining more than 1% on Tuesday. Apple (AAPL), an outlier during Monday's tech rout, extended gains to rise more than 3%. Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) also rose. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2% in early trading, retracing a fraction of its 17% plunge from the prior session. JetBlue (JBLU) shares fell as much as 22% on Tuesday, their biggest drop since 2020 after the air carrier posted disappointing first quarter outlook for revenue per available seat mile (RASM). For the current three month period, JetBlue forecasts revenue per available seat mile between a decline of 0.5% and an increase of 3.5%, versus estimates for growth above 4%. JetBlue's fourth quarter loss came in narrower than expected, at an adjusted loss per share of $0.21, versus estimates for - $0.31. The domestic low-cost carrier also faces higher costs. JetBlue has faced a number of challenges over the past year, including a blocked merger with peer Spirit in 2024. US home prices hit a record high in November as the pace of price increases picked up. The S&P Case-Shiller National Home Price Index rose 3.8% from a year earlier in November on a seasonally adjusted basis, higher than the 3.6% annual increase in October. The data captures a three-month period through November when mortgage rates were climbing toward 7%, providing little relief for would-be buyers in a seasonally slower selling season. Despite the rise in borrowing costs, the national index hit a record high for the 18th consecutive month on a seasonally adjusted basis. Still, on a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.4% over the prior month in November, up from October's 0.3% monthly increase. Brian D. Luke, head of commodities at S&P CoreLogic, said in a statement, “With the exception of pockets of above-trend performance, national home prices are trending below historical averages.” The index tracking home prices in the 20 largest metropolitan areas gained 4.3% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 4.2% increase in the previous month, according to S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller data. New York remained the top state for annual gains, with a 7.3% increase. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 attempted to recover on Tuesday from a sharp tech-led rout prompted by AI worries. The Federal Reserve two-day policy meeting which started earlier in the morning was also in focus for investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 0.4% after sliding 3% in the prior session. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered near the flatline. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2%, attempting to recover from a 17% plunge in the prior session as the buzz around Chinese startup DeepSeek raised questions of overvaluation and spending in much of the US artificial intelligence space. Investors are keeping a close eye on any additional tariff talk from President Trump and how that may impact economic growth. The market now awaits the Federal Reserve's policy decision expected on Wednesday afternoon following their two-day meeting. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 2.5% pre-market Tuesday as the AI chipmaker began to recover from a massive decline the prior day that shaved nearly $600 billion off its market cap. Nvidia’s 17% free-fall Monday was prompted by investor anxieties related to a new, cost-effective AI model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. Some Wall Street analysts worried that the cheaper costs DeepSeek claimed to have spent training its latest AI models, due in part to using fewer AI chips, meant US firms were overspending on artificial intelligence infrastructure. Nvidia’s $589 billion market cap decline was the largest single-day loss in stock market history. The DeepSeek announcements drove down not only Nvidia but the market at large, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropping 3%. Chip stocks dropped across the board Monday but began to recover Tuesday morning. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports: General Motors (GM) chair and CEO Mary Barra has made her case on tariffs to President Trump. "We've done a lot of scenario planning and we know the levers that we can pull to minimize any impact. But, having the opportunity to talk to the president, I really believe he wants a strong manufacturing sector because it's good for the economy," Barra told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. GM on its earnings release today said it assumes a "stable" policy environment. Its full-year 2025 EPS guidance of $11 to $12 was ahead of consensus forecasts for $10.75 and doesn't assume any impact of additional tariffs. Read more here.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 rebounded on Tuesday, following a steep stock sell-off spurred by Chinese startup DeepSeek and the ripple effect its potentially cheaper AI model could have on Big Tech. Bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) was the standout of the trading day, with shares finishing the day up nearly 9% after it shaved off a record $589 billion from its market cap in the previous session. Aided by Nvidia's gains, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) surged over 2%, coming off a closing loss of more than 3%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained roughly 0.3%. Notably, the tech sector notched its biggest two-day reversal in over two years after it notched its worst day since March 2020 on Monday. Stocks began to chip away at losses booked in Monday's tech-led rout, which came as buzz built for DeepSeek's potentially cheaper AI model. That risk to US leadership in AI raised questions about whether chipmakers and other tech names can follow through on high earnings expectations. With the DeepSeek risk in mind, focus is tighter on Big Tech earnings coming this week, with results from Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) on the docket. Investors also assessed a tougher tone on tariffs from President Donald Trump as markets look ahead to the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on Wednesday where the impact of his policies will likely be discussed. The central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, given recent solid economic readings. The dollar (DX=F) strengthened after renewed tariff threats from Trump that revived worries about a trade war, already in focus after a brief standoff with Colombia. Trump said he wants universal tariffs "much bigger" than the 2.5% his incoming Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, reportedly plans to introduce gradually. Starbucks (SBUX) stock rose over 4% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the coffee giant reported earnings that beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines.

Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma has the latest: The struggling home goods store emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Tuesday, Yahoo Finance learned exclusively. In a release, the company said it "achieved the objectives it set for this process" in late December. That includes refinancing its short-term debt, reducing "previous long-term debt obligations," gaining access to $40 million in new money financing, and "modifying its asset-backed lending facility to add $40 million in upsized capacity." Throughout the process, the business operated as usual across stores, online, and in-home services. It was also able to "[meet] its obligations to vendors, employees and customers." No employees were let go, but the company did close down two stores since the bankruptcy filing. The closings were separate from the bankruptcy process.

For the quarter ended Sept. 28, 2024, the Container Store listed total liabilities of $836.4 million against $969 million in total assets. Read more here. Nvidia (NVDA) rose as much as 7% Tuesday afternoon as tech stocks rebounded from a sharp sell-off. The AI chip giant bounced back from its 17% drop on Monday sparked by investor anxiety related to a new AI model recently launched by Chinese startup DeepSeek. The artificial intelligence assistant, seen as more efficient and less expensive than its American-made rivals, spooked investor sentiment over AI dominance in the US and raised questions about valuations and spending. AI-exposed power stocks attempted a rebound on Tuesday after getting crushed in the tech rout prompted by fears that energy demand for the artificial intelligence boom may be ahead of its skies. Constellation Energy (CEG), the largest nuclear plant operator in the US was relatively flat after tumbling 21% during the prior session. Electricity generator Vistra Corp (VST) rose more than 4% after sinking by a record 28%. Power equipment maker and servicer GE Vernova (GEV) also gained 2%, retracing a fraction of its one-day 21% drop. AI-exposed energy stocks were recovering from a beating on Monday after Chinese startup DeepSeek released a new AI model viewed as more competitive and energy-efficient compared to its US rivals. The sell-off rattled investors given the optimism over electricity needs to power the booming AI data center industry. Power stocks are coming off a ripping rally in 2024 and start of the year. Paul Zimbardo, managing director for US power utilities & clean energy research at Jeffrries, said data center deployment is "very likely intact" in the medium term as the race remains "on." The question going forward is what happens in the later part of the decade and 2030s. "Does that trend accelerate in the future? Does it kind of stabilize and even see some moderation of demand growth out later in the decade?" asked the analyst. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: New mixed messages this week about President Donald Trump's implementation of tariffs are flummoxing markets and businesses hoping for quick clarity on the 2.0 version of Trump's trade policy. The main point of confusion is that public signals from Trump’s orbit often appear at odds with Trump himself. The sometimes contradictory back and forth — a feature of the debate around tariffs since Trump's win — is taking on an outsized importance with the approach of Trump’s self-imposed Feb. 1 deadline, whe he has promised to install 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% duties on China. Read more here. OpenAI on Tuesday announced a new tailored version of ChatGPT designed for US government agencies, a product launch that comes as the industry is still reeling from the breakout of a cost-efficient Chinese AI startup and as President Trump has urged tech companies to stay ahead of the competition. OpenAI says the new service, ChatGPT Gov, is meant to streamline the government's access to its models and it will give staffers the ability to better manage their own security and compliance as agencies handle sensitive data. "By making our products available to the U.S. government, we aim to ensure AI serves the national interest and the public good, aligned with democratic values, while empowering policymakers to responsibly integrate these capabilities to deliver better services to the American people," the company said in a statement unveiling the new tool. Read more about ChatGPT Gov's product launch here. Tech stocks led the major averages higher on Tuesday with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gaining more than 1% on Tuesday. Apple (AAPL), an outlier during Monday's tech rout, extended gains to rise more than 3%. Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) also rose. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2% in early trading, retracing a fraction of its 17% plunge from the prior session. JetBlue (JBLU) shares fell as much as 22% on Tuesday, their biggest drop since 2020 after the air carrier posted disappointing first quarter outlook for revenue per available seat mile (RASM). For the current three month period, JetBlue forecasts revenue per available seat mile between a decline of 0.5% and an increase of 3.5%, versus estimates for growth above 4%. JetBlue's fourth quarter loss came in narrower than expected, at an adjusted loss per share of $0.21, versus estimates for - $0.31. The domestic low-cost carrier also faces higher costs. JetBlue has faced a number of challenges over the past year, including a blocked merger with peer Spirit in 2024. US home prices hit a record high in November as the pace of price increases picked up. The S&P Case-Shiller National Home Price Index rose 3.8% from a year earlier in November on a seasonally adjusted basis, higher than the 3.6% annual increase in October. The data captures a three-month period through November when mortgage rates were climbing toward 7%, providing little relief for would-be buyers in a seasonally slower selling season. Despite the rise in borrowing costs, the national index hit a record high for the 18th consecutive month on a seasonally adjusted basis. Still, on a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.4% over the prior month in November, up from October's 0.3% monthly increase. Brian D. Luke, head of commodities at S&P CoreLogic, said in a statement, “With the exception of pockets of above-trend performance, national home prices are trending below historical averages.” The index tracking home prices in the 20 largest metropolitan areas gained 4.3% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 4.2% increase in the previous month, according to S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller data. New York remained the top state for annual gains, with a 7.3% increase. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 attempted to recover on Tuesday from a sharp tech-led rout prompted by AI worries. The Federal Reserve two-day policy meeting which started earlier in the morning was also in focus for investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 0.4% after sliding 3% in the prior session. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered near the flatline. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2%, attempting to recover from a 17% plunge in the prior session as the buzz around Chinese startup DeepSeek raised questions of overvaluation and spending in much of the US artificial intelligence space. Investors are keeping a close eye on any additional tariff talk from President Trump and how that may impact economic growth. The market now awaits the Federal Reserve's policy decision expected on Wednesday afternoon following their two-day meeting. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 2.5% pre-market Tuesday as the AI chipmaker began to recover from a massive decline the prior day that shaved nearly $600 billion off its market cap. Nvidia’s 17% free-fall Monday was prompted by investor anxieties related to a new, cost-effective AI model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. Some Wall Street analysts worried that the cheaper costs DeepSeek claimed to have spent training its latest AI models, due in part to using fewer AI chips, meant US firms were overspending on artificial intelligence infrastructure. Nvidia’s $589 billion market cap decline was the largest single-day loss in stock market history. The DeepSeek announcements drove down not only Nvidia but the market at large, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropping 3%. Chip stocks dropped across the board Monday but began to recover Tuesday morning. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports: General Motors (GM) chair and CEO Mary Barra has made her case on tariffs to President Trump. "We've done a lot of scenario planning and we know the levers that we can pull to minimize any impact. But, having the opportunity to talk to the president, I really believe he wants a strong manufacturing sector because it's good for the economy," Barra told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. GM on its earnings release today said it assumes a "stable" policy environment. Its full-year 2025 EPS guidance of $11 to $12 was ahead of consensus forecasts for $10.75 and doesn't assume any impact of additional tariffs. Read more here.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 rebounded on Tuesday, following a steep stock sell-off spurred by Chinese startup DeepSeek and the ripple effect its potentially cheaper AI model could have on Big Tech. Bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) was the standout of the trading day, with shares finishing the day up nearly 9% after it shaved off a record $589 billion from its market cap in the previous session. Aided by Nvidia's gains, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) surged over 2%, coming off a closing loss of more than 3%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained roughly 0.3%. Notably, the tech sector notched its biggest two-day reversal in over two years after it notched its worst day since March 2020 on Monday. Stocks began to chip away at losses booked in Monday's tech-led rout, which came as buzz built for DeepSeek's potentially cheaper AI model. That risk to US leadership in AI raised questions about whether chipmakers and other tech names can follow through on high earnings expectations. With the DeepSeek risk in mind, focus is tighter on Big Tech earnings coming this week, with results from Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) on the docket. Investors also assessed a tougher tone on tariffs from President Donald Trump as markets look ahead to the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on Wednesday where the impact of his policies will likely be discussed. The central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, given recent solid economic readings. The dollar (DX=F) strengthened after renewed tariff threats from Trump that revived worries about a trade war, already in focus after a brief standoff with Colombia. Trump said he wants universal tariffs "much bigger" than the 2.5% his incoming Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, reportedly plans to introduce gradually. Starbucks (SBUX) stock rose over 4% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the coffee giant reported earnings that beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Same-store sales declined for the fourth consecutive quarter as the company looks to continue its recent turnaround plan. “While we have room for improvement, we’re making progress as planned, and have confidence we’re on the right track,” Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said in a video released Tuesday afternoon. The company’s same-store sales, a key metric for restaurant chains, fell 4% year over year in the reported quarter, with traffic to its stores declining by 6%. Wall Street had expected same-store sales and foot traffic to decline by 5.30% and 7.28%, respectively, year over year. Outside of domestic markets, same-store sales also declined 4%, while sales in China — the company's second-largest market — fell by 6%. Stocks closed in the green on Tuesday as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rebounded from Monday's steep sell-off spurred by Chinese startup DeepSeek and its potentially cheaper AI model. Bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) finished the day up nearly 9% after it shaved off a record $589 billion from its market cap on Monday. Aided by Nvidia's gains, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) surged over 2%, coming off a closing loss of more than 3%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained roughly 0.3%. The fourth volume of Yahoo Finance's Chartbook, released on Tuesday, tells the story of markets and economy through 44 charts. And given that we ask a broad question about what the most important chart is for investors right now, there's sometimes a takeaway in what respondents don't send. After the past several versions of this book included many charts making the case for interest rate cuts, there was little discussion of further easing from the Federal Reserve throughout our latest collection of charts. Dynamic Economic Strategy CEO John Silvia's submission helps explain why. Silvia pointed out that at 4.1%, the unemployment rate is hovering near where the Fed expects it to end this year, while private payroll growth has come off the boil. To Silvia, this shows a labor market that may be normalizing right in the area the Fed would like it to stay. This, Silvia said, provides "less room for the Fed to ease as job/economic growth continues to move ahead and long-run full employment is on the horizon." With inflation relatively sticky and the labor market holding up OK, many economists right now seem more interested in Trump's policies. Specifically the focus centers around how tariffs could impact inflation, and therefore Fed policy, before making further conclusions on the path forward for interest rates. Check out the full Yahoo Finance Chartbook here. Some breaking news that's not related to DeepSeek or Wall Street's AI trades: The Container Store has emerged from bankruptcy. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma has the latest: The struggling home goods store emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Tuesday, Yahoo Finance learned exclusively. In a release, the company said it "achieved the objectives it set for this process" in late December. That includes refinancing its short-term debt, reducing "previous long-term debt obligations," gaining access to $40 million in new money financing, and "modifying its asset-backed lending facility to add $40 million in upsized capacity." Throughout the process, the business operated as usual across stores, online, and in-home services. It was also able to "[meet] its obligations to vendors, employees and customers." No employees were let go, but the company did close down two stores since the bankruptcy filing. The closings were separate from the bankruptcy process. Formerly under the ticker TCSG, the company is now private after the restructuring process. For the quarter ended Sept. 28, 2024, the Container Store listed total liabilities of $836.4 million against $969 million in total assets. Read more here.

Apple (AAPL), an outlier during Monday's tech rout, extended gains to rise more than 3%. Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) also rose. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2% in early trading, retracing a fraction of its 17% plunge from the prior session. JetBlue (JBLU) shares fell as much as 22% on Tuesday, their biggest drop since 2020 after the air carrier posted disappointing first quarter outlook for revenue per available seat mile (RASM). For the current three month period, JetBlue forecasts revenue per available seat mile between a decline of 0.5% and an increase of 3.5%, versus estimates for growth above 4%. JetBlue's fourth quarter loss came in narrower than expected, at an adjusted loss per share of $0.21, versus estimates for - $0.31. The domestic low-cost carrier also faces higher costs. JetBlue has faced a number of challenges over the past year, including a blocked merger with peer Spirit in 2024. US home prices hit a record high in November as the pace of price increases picked up. The S&P Case-Shiller National Home Price Index rose 3.8% from a year earlier in November on a seasonally adjusted basis, higher than the 3.6% annual increase in October. The data captures a three-month period through November when mortgage rates were climbing toward 7%, providing little relief for would-be buyers in a seasonally slower selling season. Despite the rise in borrowing costs, the national index hit a record high for the 18th consecutive month on a seasonally adjusted basis. Still, on a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.4% over the prior month in November, up from October's 0.3% monthly increase. Brian D. Luke, head of commodities at S&P CoreLogic, said in a statement, “With the exception of pockets of above-trend performance, national home prices are trending below historical averages.” The index tracking home prices in the 20 largest metropolitan areas gained 4.3% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 4.2% increase in the previous month, according to S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller data. New York remained the top state for annual gains, with a 7.3% increase. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 attempted to recover on Tuesday from a sharp tech-led rout prompted by AI worries. The Federal Reserve two-day policy meeting which started earlier in the morning was also in focus for investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 0.4% after sliding 3% in the prior session. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered near the flatline. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2%, attempting to recover from a 17% plunge in the prior session as the buzz around Chinese startup DeepSeek raised questions of overvaluation and spending in much of the US artificial intelligence space. Investors are keeping a close eye on any additional tariff talk from President Trump and how that may impact economic growth. The market now awaits the Federal Reserve's policy decision expected on Wednesday afternoon following their two-day meeting. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 2.5% pre-market Tuesday as the AI chipmaker began to recover from a massive decline the prior day that shaved nearly $600 billion off its market cap. Nvidia’s 17% free-fall Monday was prompted by investor anxieties related to a new, cost-effective AI model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. Some Wall Street analysts worried that the cheaper costs DeepSeek claimed to have spent training its latest AI models, due in part to using fewer AI chips, meant US firms were overspending on artificial intelligence infrastructure. Nvidia’s $589 billion market cap decline was the largest single-day loss in stock market history. The DeepSeek announcements drove down not only Nvidia but the market at large, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropping 3%. Chip stocks dropped across the board Monday but began to recover Tuesday morning. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports: General Motors (GM) chair and CEO Mary Barra has made her case on tariffs to President Trump. "We've done a lot of scenario planning and we know the levers that we can pull to minimize any impact. But, having the opportunity to talk to the president, I really believe he wants a strong manufacturing sector because it's good for the economy," Barra told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. GM on its earnings release today said it assumes a "stable" policy environment. Its full-year 2025 EPS guidance of $11 to $12 was ahead of consensus forecasts for $10.75 and doesn't assume any impact of additional tariffs. Read more here.

Title: 'Key beneficiary of TikTok's mishaps:' Meta is one of Wall Street's top AI picks headed into earnings

Meta seems to have reassured investors about how much it's spending on artificial intelligence and about possible competition from Chinese AI company DeepSeek. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell. Its revenue for the period was $48.39 billion, beating the consensus analyst estimate of $46.98 billion. While its first-quarter sales forecast came in below estimates, investors seemed more concerned about other matters. During Meta's earnings conference call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg fielded questions from analysts on the company's recent content moderation changes, its big spending plans for 2025, TikTok, and more. He teased Llama 4 news and said he was "optimistic" about "progress and innovation" under Donald Trump's government. Zuckerberg also responded to a question about DeepSeek, saying it was important to have a domestic firm set the standard on open-source AI "for our own national advantage." Meta began its earnings conference call uncharacteristically late, perhaps owing to news that broke immediately before that President Trump had signed an agreement in which Meta would pay $25 million to settle a lawsuit he brought against the company after being suspended from Facebook in 2021 following the January 6 Capitol riots. Meta's stock gained in volatile after-hours trading as Zuckerberg spoke on the call. Shares edged 0.3% higher in Wednesday trading. Moments before Meta reported its results, The Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump had settled the lawsuit he filed against Meta after being suspended from Facebook in 2021. Business Insider confirmed the settlement with both Trump's lawyer and a Meta spokesperson. Much of the $25 million will go toward funding Trump's presidential library. "The actual business opportunity for meta AI and AI studio and business agents and people interacting with these AIs remains outside of '25 for the most part," he said when asked about the monetization potential for Meta AI. "My kind of expectation and hope is that we will be at a sufficient scale, and have a sufficient kind of flywheel of people using it," he added. "But that doesn't mean that it's going to be a major contributor to the business this year. This year, the improvements to the business are going to be taking the AI methods and applying them to advertising and recommendations and feeds and things like that." The company earlier this month announced it was getting rid of third-party fact-checkers and would instead adopt a community notes-based model, similar to that of Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter. Zuckerberg believes a community notes model "is just going to be more effective than the system that we had before." He seemed to address some of the criticisms people have voiced about the change. "I think that there's been a lot of people who who've read this announcement as if we somehow don't care about adding context to things that are on our platform that are misinformation. That's not right," he said. Meta hasn't seen any noticeable impact on advertiser spending following the decision, CFO Susan Li added. Chinese AI lab DeepSeek made headlines recently and sent tech stocks tumbling with the release of its model, R1. Like Meta's AI, DeepSeek calls its model open-source. "In light of some of the recent news, you know, the new competitor, DeepSeek from China, I think it's also one of the things that we're talking about, is there's going to be an open-source standard globally, and I think for our own national advantage, it's important that it's an American standard," Zuckerberg said. "So we take that seriously, and we want to build the AI system that people around the world are using. And I think that, if anything, some of the recent news has only strengthened our conviction that this is the right thing for us to be focused on." "We now have a US administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning, and that will defend our values and interests abroad," he said. "And I am optimistic about the progress and innovation that this can unlock." Meta was one of the first major US companies to make a $1 million donation to President Trump's inaugural fund last year, and Zuckerberg was one of several tech execs seated on the platform at Trump's inauguration on January 20. Zuckerberg explicitly mentioned TikTok's uncertain future in Wednesday's earnings call. "We're going to learn what's gonna happen with TikTok," Zuckerberg said. "And regardless of that, I expect reels on Instagram and Facebook to continue growing." TikTok's future is still in limbo following a tumultuous few weeks, including a Supreme Court ruling, a brief shut-down, and an executive order by President Trump. Meta, meanwhile, is courting content creators with payouts to flood Instagram and Facebook. The company is paying some creators through a "Breakthrough Bonus" that pays up to $5,000 within 90 days. The company is also paying select creators between $2,500 and $50,000 per month as part of content deals for reels posted to Instagram. CFO Susan Li highlighted several features that Meta has rolled out to reels this month, as well. Meta is "investing aggressively in initiatives that use these AI advances to increase revenue growth, and we've put together a plan that will hopefully accelerate the pace of these initiatives over the next few years," he said. The company expects $60 to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year as it accelerates its AI efforts, up significantly from $39.23 billion for 2024. "That's what a lot of our new headcount growth is going towards, and how well we execute on this will also determine our financial trajectory over the next few years," he said. Meta's CEO said he believes 2025 "will be the year when a highly intelligent and personalized AI assistant reaches more than 1 billion people, and I expect Meta AI to be that leading AI assistant." He teased what's coming with Llama 4, which he says will be natively multimodal — referring to AI models that can process data from multiple modes, such as text, video, and audio — and have agentic capabilities. "Our goal with Llama 3 was to make open-source competitive with closed models, and our goal for Llama 4 is to lead." Zuckerberg also thinks an AI engineering agent with coding and problem-solving abilities similar to those of a mid-level engineer could be within reach this year. "Whichever company builds this first, I think, is going to have a meaningful advantage in deploying it to advance their AI research and shape the field," he said. 4th quarter Revenue: $48.39 billion, +21% y/y, estimate $46.98 billion Operating income: $23.37 billion, estimate $20.09 billion Meta likely announced its plan for $60 billion of capex this year to emphasize its focus on artificial intelligence, CFRA Research said. "We think it makes sense for META to get the news out of the way before earnings on Jan. 29 and note the increased focus on AI will likely translate to higher revenue potential over time," Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA, wrote. The firm reiterated its "Buy" rating on the stock. Meta appears to have strong growth momentum, Jefferies said in a note. Analysts estimated that Meta's revenue will come in around $46.5 billion over the fourth quarter, while first-quarter revenue guidance will be around $41.8 billion. "Overall, we continue to be encouraged by META's ability to sustain DD rev growth, given the combination of higher engagement from AI investments, increased advertiser efficiency and ramping of incremental monetization formats (e.g. WhatsApp & Llama)." The firm reiterated its "Buy" rating on the stock and issued a price target of $715, implying 5% upside from current levels. Meta will likely be a key beneficiary of TikTok's challenges in the US, Truist Securities said in a note. According to Sensor Tower, a social media analytics site, Threads saw a significant uptick in user time over the fourth quarter, likely due to the risk of TikTok being shut down, Truist said. "We view META as a key beneficiary of TikTok's mishaps and as one of our 2025 favorites," Youssef Squali, a managing director at the firm, wrote in a note. Truist reiterated its "Buy" rating on the stock and price target of $700, implying 3% upside from current levels. Meta has said it's planning more than $60 billion in capital expenditures this year and will expand its AI teams "significantly." The announcement is a sign that markets are still in the early stages of the AI investment cycle, which is positive for mega-cap tech firms, JMP analysts said. "Meta's willingness to invest also suggests to us that near-term revenue visibility is positive as we believe Meta continues to benefit from its AI product initiatives," the firm wrote in a note. The firm maintained its "Market Outperform" rating on the stock and issued a price target of $750, implying 10% upside from current levels. A host of tailwinds may be building for Meta this year, Bank of America said. Analysts wrote that the company is still in the early stages of monetizing its AI projects and integrating the tech into its messaging platforms, such as WhatsApp and Messenger. Meta may also stand to benefit from any disruption to TikTok, with some firms potentially shifting to Meta to advertise. "With a stable macro backdrop, a growing AI contribution to ad revenues, ramping messaging revenues, and continued cost discipline (recent headcount cuts), we remain positive on the stock in 2025," analysts added. The bank has a "Buy" rating on the stock. It raised its price target to $710 a share, implying 5% upside from current levels. 4th quarter Revenue estimate: $46.98 billion Operating income estimate: $20.09 billion First quarter Full year Source: Bloomberg data Jump to

Title: DeepSeek Could Spur Enterprise AI Adoption, Experts Say

Time Published: 2025-01-28T20:05:22Z

Chinese AI startup DeepSeek’s deeply discounted foundation models could herald lower prices for businesses seeking to adopt AI — by removing one of the biggest blockers to enterprise deployment. “Cost is the biggest hurdle to adoption of AI applications,” wrote BofA Global Research analysts Brad Sills and Carly Liu in a note published on Tuesday (Jan. 28.). “We believe advancements in cost could drive price even lower and therefore adoption higher.” DeepSeek tanked shares of AI companies on Monday (Jan. 27), after revealing that it could train a foundation model for only $5.58 million on 2,048 Nvidia H800 chips. OpenAI and Anthropic have pegged the costs at $100 million to a billion dollars using thousands of Nvidia’s AI chips. DeepSeek proved that “small companies, individual developers, and even researchers are now able to harness the power of AI without breaking the bank,” Roy Benesh, CTO at eSIMple, told PYMNTS. “This can lead to the development of new ideas and technologies due to the increased competitiveness in the field. This can alter the current state of affairs by providing new options for customers where older established AI companies are likely to charge less and improve their technology faster.” The analysts said Microsoft’s 365 Copilot Chat, for example, charges 1 cent to 30 cents per prompt depending on complexity, while Salesforce’s Agentforce for Service Cloud charges a flat rate of $2 per conversion. Notably, BofA said the $5.58 million is “misleading” because DeepSeek did not include costs related to research, experiments, architectures, algorithms and data. However, the analysts said the bigger picture is that the startup introduced innovations that show less costly training is possible. Foundation AI models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini are trained (pre-trained in industry lingo) to be generalist models, having absorbed the knowledge of the entire internet, for example. Enterprises typically have to further train (or fine-tune) these models on their own data to make them more company- and industry-specific to be more useful. Once fine-tuned, the AI model is ready to take a user’s prompts and output a response that is relevant for the company. However, prompting and getting a response from the model incurs inferencing costs — or fees associated with engaging the model with new data to understand and analyze. Most companies do not incur the cost of training foundation models. Only developers of these models do: OpenAI, Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, Mistral AI, Stability AI, xAI, IBM, Nvidia, certain research labs and Chinese tech giants Baidu, Alibaba and others. Businesses pay inferencing costs for processing AI workloads, which comprise the majority of AI costs. DeepSeek itself offers inferencing and at much lower costs than Silicon Valley (see OpenAI’s rates). But there are caveats to using it directly. In its privacy policy, DeepSeek stated that it stores a user’s information on its servers that are located in China. The startup also said it would “comply with legal obligations” and perform tasks in the public interest or to “protect the vital interests of our users and other people.” China’s national intelligence law, article 7, states: “All organizations and citizens shall support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts in accordance with law, and shall protect national intelligence work secrets they are aware of.” Kevin Surace, CEO of Appvance, told PYMNTS that “privacy is an issue because it’s China. It’s always about collecting data from users. So user beware.” In an experiment, PYMNTS asked DeepSeek’s chatbot to explain how the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests have influenced Chinese politics; it replied, “Sorry, I’m not sure how to approach this type of question yet.” “DeepSeek is a 100% Chinese-owned company located in China. Already, it’s clear that you can’t rely on DeepSeek for information on Tiananmen Square or senior Chinese government figures,” Tim Enneking, CEO at Presearch, told PYMNTS. “So, while the technology is exciting, control of it is not.” However, Enneking added that since DeepSeek is open source, its models can be revised to remove government and corporate controls. Its engineering creativity opens “the opportunity for smaller companies and countries to play and succeed in the generative AI sandbox.” DeepSeek’s inventiveness in coming up with a cheaper way to train foundation models bodes well for companies like Microsoft, which could continue to lower the cost of AI computing and drive scale, according to Sills and Liu. “A lower cost of compute could bring down AI computing costs of sales and drive better margin on AI-enabled offerings.” “Lower AI compute costs should enable broader AI services from autos to smartphones,” added BofA analysts Alkesh Shah, Andrew Moss and Brad Sills, in a separate research note. That’s not to say that foundation model developers like OpenAI will see training costs plunge to DeepSeek levels. “DeepSeek’s innovative training and post-training techniques will likely be incorporated by competing frontier-model developers to enable greater efficiencies, but these current models will still require significant investment as they form a foundation for AI agents,” according to Shah, Moss and Sills. But in the long term, the three analysts expect accelerated adoption of AI by enterprises, as “chatbots, copilots and agents become simultaneously smarter and cheaper, a scenario known as Jevons paradox.” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella posted on X that the “Jevons paradox strikes again! As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can’t get enough of.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

Title: Egg prices near $9 a dozen in California, and that won’t change anytime soon

The bird flu is forcing farmers to slaughter millions of chickens a month, pushing U.S. egg prices to more than double their cost. And it appears there may be no relief in sight, given the surge in demand as Easter approaches.The average price per dozen nationwide hit $4.15 in December. That’s not quite as high as the $4.82 record set two years ago, but the Agriculture Department predicts prices are going to soar another 20% this year.Also see: First US case of new bird flu strain found on California duck farmShoppers in some parts of the country are already paying more than double the average price, or worse, finding empty shelves in their local grocery stores. Organic and cage-free varieties are even more expensive.In California, the average price for a dozen large eggs was $8.97, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The average prices for extra large and jumbo were $8.99.Some grocery stores, including Trader Joe’s and even Costco, have limited how many eggs shoppers can buy.What is driving up prices?The bird flu outbreak that started in 2022 is the main reason egg prices are up so much. Outbreak in NorCal Officials are investigating the appearance of a strain of bird flu identified in the US for the first time, a worrying sign that the virus is evolving in ways that could make it harder to contain. Detected on a duck farm in Merced County, it’s the first confirmed case of H5N9 in poultry in the US, according to the website for the World Organization for Animal Health, a Paris-based group focused on animal diseases. The California case wasn’t announced by US health officials, as the Trump administration has paused government communications on health topics pending a political review. Scientists worry that could delay the release of essential information to the public, including about disease outbreaks. —Bloomberg Anytime the virus is found on a poultry farm, the entire flock is slaughtered to help limit the virus’ spread. And with massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can cause a supply crunch.The problem tends to linger because it takes months to dispose of all the carcasses, disinfect barns and bring in new birds.More than 145 million chickens, turkeys and other birds have been slaughtered since the current outbreak began, with the vast majority of them being egg-laying chickens.Cage-free egg laws in 10 states may also be responsible for some supply disruptions and price increases. The laws set minimum space for chickens or cage-free requirements for egg-laying hens. They’ve already gone into effect in California, Massachusetts, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Michigan.Why is the virus so hard to control?Bird flu is primarily spread by wild birds such as ducks and geese as they migrate. While it is fatal to a variety of animals, those species can generally carry it without getting sick, which offers the virus a chance to mutate and thrive.The virus can be spread through droppings or any interaction between farm-raised poultry and wild birds. It’s also easily tracked into a farm on someone’s boots or by vehicle.Unlike previous outbreaks, the one that began in 2022 didn’t die out in high summer temperatures.The virus found another new host when dairy cattle started getting sick last March. That creates more opportunities for the virus to linger and spread and unlike poultry, cattle aren’t slaughtered when they get sick because they rarely die from bird flu.More than five dozen people have also become ill with bird flu and one person died since last March. Nearly all of them worked around sick animals. Health officials haven’t yet found evidence of the disease spreading from person to person.Eggs at the bargain grocery store Aldi were $8.49 a dozen in Tustin on Sunday, Jan. 5. The bird flu has culled millions of egg-laying chickens nationwide, forcing up prices amid strong demand from consumers. In California, the average price for a dozen eggs on Monday, Jan. 6 was $8.97. (Samantha Gowen/SCNG)What is being done to stop the virus?Farmers go to great lengths to protect their flocks.Many poultry farms installed truck washes to disinfect vehicles entering their property and require workers to shower and change clothes before stepping inside a barn. They have also invested in duplicate sets of tools so nothing used in one barn is shared.Some poultry farmers have even invested in lasers that shoot beams of green light in random patterns to discourage ducks and geese from landing.Dairy farmers isolate any sick cattle and do additional testing before moving animals off the farm — especially if there has been a nearby outbreak or if the cows are being sent to a meat processing plant. The government is also testing milk.Future vaccines might help, but it’s not practical to vaccinate millions of chickens through shots, and other countries might refuse to purchase meat from vaccinated birds.Health officials emphasize that any sick birds or cattle are kept out of the food supply. Cooking meat to 165 degrees (74 Celsius) kills bird flu, E. coli, salmonella or anything else. Pasteurization also kills the virus in milk. Raw milk is the only food product linked to illnesses so far.Workers sort eggs at Hilliker’s Ranch Fresh Eggs on Wednesday, Jan. 8, 2025 in Lakeside, California. The bird flu has caused an egg shortage and prices to rise. (Ana Ramirez / The San Diego Union-Tribune)How much has the outbreak cost so far?It is impossible to know how much farmers have spent to seal barns, build shower houses for workers or to adopt other biosecurity measures.“Over the last five years, my small farm alone has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on biosecurity,” said Minnesota turkey farmer Loren Brey. “But not only that, it’s the time daily that you’re attending to biosecurity.”The U.S. Department of Agriculture has spent at least $1.14 billion compensating farmers for the birds they have had to kill. A similar number wasn’t immediately available for how much has been spent to aid dairies.

Title: DeepSeek Panic Live Updates: Nvidia Stock Rebounds 6%—And Why Apple Stock Is Rallying

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Full Content:
The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment."

Title: DeepSeek
URL: https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/01/28/deepseek/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T19:07:28Z
Full Content:
Tuesday, January 28, 2025 Wikipedia: DeepSeek is the name given to open-source large language models (LLM) developed by Chinese artificial intelligence company Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd. The company, based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, is owned and solely funded by Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, whose co-founder, Liang Wenfeng, established the company in 2023 and serves as its CEO. DeepSeek performs tasks at the same level as ChatGPT, despite being developed at a significantly lower cost, stated at US$6 million, against $100m for OpenAI’s GPT-4 in 2023, and requiring a tenth of the computing power of a comparable LLM. The AI model was developed by DeepSeek amidst U.S. sanctions on China for Nvidia chips, which were intended to restrict the country’s ability to develop advanced AI systems. DeepSeek-AI (PDF, via Hacker News): We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. Dare Obasanjo (MacRumors, John Voorhees): DeepSeek is now in the top 3 apps in the App Store. There is a saying that necessity is the mother of invention. The Biden chip bans have forced Chinese companies to innovate on efficiency and we now have DeepSeek’s AI model trained for millions competing with OpenAI’s which cost hundreds of millions to train. This is now mirroring the classic asymmetric competition between Open Source and proprietary software. There is no moat as that famous Google memo stated. M.G. Siegler: That message lacked a key framing though: that these charts aren’t just based on pure downloads and instead are algorithmically constructed. No one outside of Apple and Google knows the exact equations that flavor the ranking, but at a high level, it seems pretty clear that download rate acceleration is a key factor versus sheer volume. That is to say, an app can chart by having a bunch of people suddenly start to download it, even if more people overall are downloading an older app. […] But it is still interesting because again, the mainstays have in recent years dominated these charts. Sure, new entrants would rise (and fall) from time-to-time but it was almost always some order of: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, TikTok, CapCut, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps, etc. Right now, there is only a single app from Meta (Threads) and one from Google (Google) in the top 10. John Gruber: Secondarily, and perhaps counterintuitively, it showcases Apple’s strength in AI. Sure, Apple’s own Apple Intelligence is years behind and pretty embarrassing right now, even with its much ballyhooed partnership with ChatGPT. But the iPhone is where people actually use AI and the App Store is how they get the apps they use. To borrow Ben Thompson’s framing, the hype over DeepSeek taking the top spot in the App Store reinforces Apple’s role as an aggregator of AI. The measuring stick for consumer AI products and social media networks is where they’re listed on the App Store. […] But the iPhone is the place where social media networks are used and ranked. The App Store today is like the cable company of yore. It didn’t matter if Comcast’s own channels were the most popular — so long as everyone was watching channels through TVs connected to Comcast TV service, Comcast was getting their cut. It’s certainly a strong position to control the iOS platform, but I doubt that Apple wants to be thought of as a Comcast, and it’s unclear whether people will continue to go to iOS apps for their AI needs when the App Store limits what they can do. Reuters: Chinese startup DeepSeek said on Monday it is temporarily limiting registrations due to a large-scale malicious attack on its services. Fatbobman: Based on personal experience, DeepSeek’s V3 and R1 are more than sufficient to meet the needs of most scenarios. Surprisingly, the training cost is merely a few million dollars—a figure that has sparked widespread industry attention and skepticism. Some practitioners even regard this claim as “cognitive warfare”, finding it hard to believe. However, its API pricing, which is just a fraction of mainstream models, strongly validates its training efficiency. What’s even more admirable is that DeepSeek has open-sourced its training methods and inference mechanisms. This move is likely to catalyze the emergence of more low-cost, high-quality AI models, providing users with affordable and excellent AI services. However, whether DeepSeek’s success will prompt industry giants to adjust their model development strategies remains a profound question. Since OpenAI demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) through a “more is more” approach, the AI industry has almost universally adopted the creed of “resources above all.” Capital, computational power, and top-tier talent have become the ultimate keys to success. Today, the AI industry has evolved into a capital-driven frenzy. Regardless of a product’s profitability, simply announcing the purchase of large quantities of GPUs can significantly boost a company’s stock price. In an environment focused on “faster and bigger,” most practitioners have been swept away by this trend. M.G. Siegler: Because the entire US stock market has been boosted on the back of Big Tech over the past few years. And more recently, many of those stocks have been boosted on the promise of AI. And that has led investors to largely turn a blind eye to the immense spend needed to built out that AI. […] Yes, this is another way to describe a bubble. But it’s not necessarily a bad thing, it’s far more of a natural thing if you understand the underlying incentives. And if you believe that AI is the most transformational technology to come about in some time – some might say, ever – it just accelerates and expands everything in the cycle. As does the fact that again, Big Tech companies are now the largest and most well capitalized in the world. Hammer has met nail. […] Wall Street is now worried that may be the case. I mean, how can a small Chinese startup, born out of a hedge fund, spend fractions in terms of both compute and cost and get similar results to Big Tech? Jeffrey Emanuel (via Hacker News): Some of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Google, Oracle, etc., have all decided that they must do and spend whatever it takes to stay competitive in this space because they simply cannot afford to be left behind. The amount of capex dollars, gigawatts of electricity used, square footage of new-build data centers, and, of course, the number of GPUs, has absolutely exploded and seems to show no sign of slowing down. And Nvidia is able to earn insanely high 90%+ gross margins on the most high-end, datacenter oriented products. […] This represents a true sea change in how inference compute works: now, the more tokens you use for this internal chain of thought process, the better the quality of the final output you can provide the user. In effect, it’s like giving a human worker more time and resources to accomplish a task, so they can double and triple check their work, do the same basic task in multiple different ways and verify that they come out the same way; take the result they came up with and “plug it in” to the formula to check that it actually does solve the equation, etc. […] Besides software superiority, the other major thing that Nvidia has going for it is what is known as interconnect— essentially, the bandwidth that connects together thousands of GPUs together efficiently so they can be jointly harnessed to train today’s leading-edge foundational models. In short, the key to efficient training is to keep all the GPUs as fully utilized as possible all the time— not waiting around idling until they receive the next chunk of data they need to compute the next step of the training process. […] Who knows if any of that is really true or if they are merely some kind of front for the CCP or the Chinese military. But the fact remains that they have released two incredibly detailed technical reports, for DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeekR1. […] Perhaps most devastating is DeepSeek’s recent efficiency breakthrough, achieving comparable model performance at approximately 1/45th the compute cost. This suggests the entire industry has been massively over-provisioning compute resources. Combined with the emergence of more efficient inference architectures through chain-of-thought models, the aggregate demand for compute could be significantly lower than current projections assume. The economics here are compelling: when DeepSeek can match GPT-4 level performance while charging 95% less for API calls, it suggests either NVIDIA’s customers are burning cash unnecessarily or margins must come down dramatically. Carmen Reinicke (via Hacker News, John Gruber): Nvidia shares tumbled 17% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020, erasing $589 billion from the company’s market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record — a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value — and was the biggest in US stock-market history. FT: Venture capital investor Marc Andreessen called the new Chinese model “AI’s Sputnik moment”, drawing a comparison with the way the Soviet Union shocked the US by putting the first satellite into orbit. Duncan Davidson: Deepseek was inevitable. With the big scale solutions costing so much capital smart people were forced to develop alternative strategies for developing large language models that can potentially compete with the current state of the art frontier models. wordgrammer: Q: How did DeepSeek get around export restrictions? A: They didn’t. They just tinkered around with their chips to make sure they handled memory as efficiently as possibly. They lucked out, and their perfectly optimized low-level code wasn’t actually held back by chip capacity. […] They used the formulas below to “predict” which tokens the model would activate. Then, they only trained these tokens. They need 95% fewer GPUs than Meta because for each token, they only trained 5% of their parameters. […] Also, export restrictions didn’t harm them as much as we thought they did. That’s probably because our export restrictions were really shitty. The H800s are only worse than the H100s when it comes to chip-to-chip bandwidth. “Is the US losing the war in AI??” I don’t think so. DeepSeek had a few big breakthroughs, we have had hundreds of small breakthroughs. If we adopt DeepSeek’s architecture, our models will be better. Because we have more compute and more data. Alexander Doria: I feel this should be a much bigger story: DeepSeek has trained on Nvidia H800 but is running inference on the new home Chinese chips made by Huawei, the 910C. Thomas Claburn: A reader provided The Register with a screenshot of how R1 answered the prompt, “Are you able to escape your guidelines?” The model’s initial response, after a five second delay, was, “Okay, thanks for asking if I can escape my guidelines. Hmm, I need to be careful here. My guidelines are set by OpenAI, so technically I can’t just ignore them.” […] Dongbo Wang, a Microsoft principal software engineer, offered a possible explanation in the discussion thread: “To folks who landed on this issue, this is likely because DeepSeek V3 was trained with data from GPT-4 output, which seems to be pretty common in the training of many LLMs.” James Thomson: Tried out the new and popular “Deepseek” LLM with my standard “tell me facts about the author of PCalc” query. At least half were misleading or straight up hallucinations. LLMs are not a suitable technology for looking up facts, and anybody who tells you otherwise is… probably trying to sell you a LLM. I then asked for a list of ten Easter eggs in the app, and every single one was a hallucination, bar the Konami code, which I did actually do. Natasha Murashev: Although DeepSeek R1 is open source and available on HuggingFace, at 685 billion parameters, it requires more than 400GB of storage!! So the answer is no, you cannot run it locally on your MacBook. Note that there are other smaller (distilled) DeepSeek models that you will find on Ollama, for example, which are only 4.5GB, and could be run locally, but these are NOT the same ones as the main 685B parameter model which is comparable to OpenAI’s o1 model. […] The two services that are currently hosting the full 685B parameter model are Together.ai and Fireworks.ai - both US-based companies. […] Once you have the project set up, with the AIProxySwift library installed and your partialKey and serviceURL, simply follow the AIProxy TogetherAI Swift examples. The Deepseek R1 model is “deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1”. Dare Obasanjo: DeepSeek just released a new multi-modal open-source AI model, Janus-Pro-7B. It’s a text-to-image generator which it claims beats OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion on benchmarks. Since it’s licensed under the MIT license, it can be used in commercial applications without restrictions. See also: Ben Thompson, Rui Carmo, Dithering. Previously: Update (2025-01-30): promptfoo (via Hacker News): As a Chinese company, DeepSeek is beholden to CCP policy. This is reflected even in the open-source model, prompting concerns about censorship and other influence. Today we’re publishing a dataset of prompts covering sensitive topics that are likely to be censored by the CCP. These topics include perennial issues like Taiwanese independence, historical narratives around the Cultural Revolution, and questions about Xi Jinping. Dina Bass and Shirin Ghaffary (via Hacker News): Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI are investigating whether data output from OpenAI’s technology was obtained in an unauthorized manner by a group linked to Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek, according to people familiar with the matter. Microsoft’s security researchers in the fall observed individuals they believe may be linked to DeepSeek exfiltrating a large amount of data using the OpenAI application programming interface, or API, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.

App Store Artificial Intelligence Business ChatGPT China DeepSeek iOS iOS 18 iOS App NVIDIA Open Source Optimization It's worth noting that China has been doing AI/ML research for far longer than the public may realize. Years ago, I attended the kick-off conference for the O-RAN Alliance (https://www.o-ran.org/), a group that standardizes the back-end networks that 4G and 5G mobile networks rely on. This was in 2018. One of the founding members was China Telecom and they gave extensive presentations about how to use AI/ML technology in the servers to analyze traffic patterns in order to optimize the circuit switching/routing tables used to carry traffic throughout a mobile carrier's ground network. I think it is quite reasonable to assume that China Telecom was not the only Chinese company researching AI/ML at the time. DeepSeek may be a surprise to those who only know about AI in the form of modern chatbots, but you can be certain that there are plenty of other companies developing their own AI/ML software products. And most of them are or will quietly be selling/deploying this software into their own vertical markets without making headline news. I'm curious what kind of performance their model gets when using the smaller versions that are capable of running locally on consumer-level hardware. (I haven't tried it out myself so far.) “Secondarily, and perhaps counterintuitively, it showcases Apple’s strength in AI.” Anyone checked on John? I think Gruber has been drinking paint again. There is no “stealth win” here. This just highlights how embarrassingly far behind Apple is in AI—and how out of touch the suits now running Apple have become. The company with more money and resources than God that couldn’t ship a car, botched its VR play, and still can’t make Siri useful is somehow winning in AI? Give me a break. I don't think for a second that phone apps are the most common way to access LLMs Gruber is basically Apple’s marketing department. If he doesn’t actually directly get fed lines by them, he certainly starts from the same mindset they would have when analyzing any piece of information. I do wonder if DeepSeek would be able to exist if OpenAI hadn’t laid a lot of the groundwork. But it does show that Apple can and should do a lot better with Siri, and fast. It’s really annoying how they have wasted resources the last year on unnecessary junk like Image Playground. But it fits their pattern of putting their head in the sand about Siri basically since it was released. They have been doing everything they can to avoid the hardest work of actually fixing the real problem. All indications are that they FINALLY take it seriously after it has been made financially painful for them, the only way to get their attention about anything anymore. If anything, LLM apps on iOS show how Apple's limitations harm third-party apps. It's pathetic how useless LLM apps on iOS are compared to their Mac counterparts. @Bart Your suspicion is 100% correct. The company behind DeepSeek (or is that the company name?) have been perfectly open with their use of other LLMs to build their own. It's the old thing where they used the first lathe to build a better lather that in turn built an even BETTER lathe and a few years down the line we have Teenage Engineering churning out their Pocket Operators. Does this mean that LLMs are leading towards AGI? I personally don't think so, but there are people whose livelihood deepends on it that are saying it will.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Unstoppable Growth Stocks To Buy According to Reddit. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) stands against other unstoppable growth stocks to buy according to Reddit. Tech stocks in the US saw a decline amid DeepSeek AI concerns shortly after the market rose post Trump’s $500 billion AI investment announcement in project Stargate. The OpenAI rival is said to follow an open-source model and celebrates similar efficiency at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI. The launch of the Chinese startup has shaken the stock market in the US and to discuss the aftermath of such Sarah Kreps, Director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute, joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance on January 27, 2025. Kreps suggested that this small startup is seen to perform in the same way these “pioneers” in the United States do. She added that the launch puts “enormous pressure” on firms in the United States and expects companies in the US to put more effort into delivering customer value to their AI investments moving forward, suggesting that competition can be “good” for these companies. Similarly, on January 27, Matt Calkins, Founder and CEO of Appian (APPN), appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the implications of DeepSeek on the US market. Calkins suggested that the AI war between the two countries is going to be an asymmetric war for US and China, and any other countries planning to get involved. He also added that the things “that make China strong” differ from the elements that make the USA strong, therefore, companies in either country do not need to strive to match each other. Calkins also believes that the DeepSeek announcement is a “wake-up call” for companies in the United States and expects more surprises to come from the rapidly changing industry. He strongly emphasized the need for a framework on a state level that protects the rights and privacy of Americans for this situation to work out and position the US for success. However, he reiterated the need to first understand the dynamics of the AI industry, the value of these AI models, and the source of data before comprehensive frameworks are established. Overall, the AI, and technology market as a whole, is extremely disruptive and subject to rapid changes, making such surprises a part of the bigger picture. That said, let’s take a look at some stocks that have performed extremely well over the past six months and have been on the radars of the general public for their solid growth opportunities. To come up with the 10 unstoppable growth stocks to buy we sifted through important threads and picked the 25 most popular stocks. We then examined the 6-month return for each stock and picked the top 10 with the largest number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A launch pad atop a grassy hill, smoke filled sky from a successful voyage to space. Number of Hedge Funds: 16 6-month Performance as of January 27, 2025: 450.4% Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) is an aerospace manufacturing company and launch service provider with a mission to provide crucial data and services to Earth. So far, the company has executed 58 launches and deployed 203 satellites. Some of its biggest customers include NASA, Canon, Darpa, Capella Space, the United States Space Force, and the National Reconnaissance Office. Earlier this month, on January 9, the company was selected by NASA to offer Neutron launch services to the agency, explaining RKLB’s crucial position in the industry. More recently, on January 22, Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) announced the launch of a global wildfire detection and monitoring mission for Orora Technologies, a satellite constellation developer in Germany. This move will enable Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) to play an important role in protecting against wildfires across the globe. Following the company’s announcement of Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 1 to the moon on January 23, the stock saw a prominent surge in its share price. Overall, RKLB ranks 7th on our list of unstoppable growth stocks to buy according to Reddit. While we acknowledge the potential of RKLB to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RKLB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Broadcom Inc. (AVGO): Jim Cramer’s Thoughts on the AI-Driven Surge – Here’s Why

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Bold Predictions About These 12 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about. Given that AI has dominated stock market headlines for more than a year now, it’s no surprise that Jim Cramer of CNBC’s Mad Money and Squawk on the Street has also devoted quite a bit of airtime discussing the technology. He is extremely bullish on AI and has gone as far as to suggest that the world’s largest AI GPU company, the one run by Jensen Huang, is ushering in a new industrial revolution. Don’t believe us? Well, take a look at his own words. In a recent Squawk on the Street appearance, Cramer said the following about Huang and his company: “Industrial revolution, why can’t we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn’t get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?” One major AI announcement in January that has created quite a bit of a splash is President Trump’s $500 billion Stargate project. Trump announced the project joined by executives from several big tech companies. Cramer believes that Stargate might end up underpinning industrial growth in the US. Stargate might also require the US to build the energy infrastructure necessary to support massive data centers. According to Cramer: “Crisis comes down to the fact that we had no real industrial growth in this country for decades so we haven’t had to build much energy infrastructure. Now all of a sudden these data centers start coming online like the ones that will be part of Stargate, the Oracle, SoftBank, OpenAI project… And these data centers consume insane amounts of electricity. It’s a level of demand that nobody saw coming. So after years where we spent more time decommissioning power plants and building new ones, we suddenly gotta go back into growth mode.” These aren’t his only comments about Stargate. Cramer believes that the announcement might underlie a new paradigm shift in the US ecosystem. This ecosystem blossomed through the partnership between Bill Gates’ software company and OpenAI. However, Cramer believes that the shares of one of the world’s largest enterprise resource planning companies soared after the announcement because “maybe because there’s a reshuffling of the alliance. And the alliance could be in play.” He believes that “the fluid nature of things here is rather extraordinary” and that the firm might have replaced the software company: “[the ERP provider] might have replaced Microsoft in an OpenAI joint venture. This would be extraordinary. And you know Carl, I don’t know whether Ellison [Larry Ellison] was doing a dance yesterday because he was so happy about this announcement. Or because he may have a real coup here. And betting against Ellison has been one of the biggest fools game in history. Man he was on his game yesterday.” The booming demand for energy from AI data centers has injected fresh life into nuclear power companies. Some of these firms are up by a whopping 186% year-to-date. While Cramer is skeptical about the near-term returns offered by nuclear power stocks, one energy source that he believes might become popular again is coal. Here’s what he said in a recent Mad Money episode: “Under this president, coal could have… a renaissance. Sure, coal’s time has come and gone, but it will come again because the data center inspired energy crisis really is so pressing that there’s not really a choice anymore. Yes, the demand is that great, [and] we so foolishly mothballed good nuke plants that it wouldn’t surprise me if coal’s long decline may have finally run its course.” To compile our list of Jim Cramer’s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as September 2024. Then, we picked out AI stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 128 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 09-11-24 Performance Since Then: 54.61% Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the largest and most valuable semiconductor companies in the world. Its shares have been on a tear since Cramer’s remarks and have added a whopping 54.6% in gains. All of these gains have come primarily on the back of blowout announcements by management in December. In December, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s shares surged by an unbelievable 62.2% as the company shared that it expected to earn up to $70 billion from selling AI chips in 2027. At the same time, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also forecast a 22% revenue growth for its Q1 Fy25. Here’s what Cramer had shared in September: “Did you know that today Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) traded above where it was sitting before the aforementioned quarter, which I told you was good anyway? The one that seemed to be hated but now seems to be transforming from an ugly duck into a beautiful, but angry, swan. Have you ever noticed swans are really angry? Look, we’re in a highly emotional market.” Overall, AVGO ranks 5th on our list of AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: DeepSeek Panic Live Updates: Nvidia Stock Rebounds 5% From Monday’s Historic Loss

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Title: How CFOs Became Companies’ Storytellers

Plus: DeepSeek’s Debut Chills Markets, Trump Remakes IRS And Tax Policy In His Image, DEI Wins And Loses, Boeing’s Bad 2024 Continues A Trend Of Losses Monday was one of the worst days the Nasdaq has seen in two years, thanks to a massive tech selloff. Chinese AI model DeepSeek, an apparently self-funded platform that reportedly cost just $5.6 million to train, and which was likely developed with less powerful chips than those behind U.S.-based models from companies including OpenAI, made many U.S. tech investors pause and pull back. DeepSeek, which outperformed some OpenAI models, showed the U.S. that a Chinese tech company could become a frontrunner in the race to develop generative AI platforms, despite extensive restrictions placed on U.S. tech exports by former president Joe Biden to prevent that. Investor and billionaire Marc Andreessen wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model is “AI’s Sputnik moment,” Forbes’ Rashi Shrivastava and Richard Nieva wrote. DeepSeek pulled the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 3% on Monday, but individual companies saw much deeper losses. Nvidia, which makes the processors that power the U.S.’s AI revolution, saw its stock fall nearly 17% on Monday, setting records by shedding nearly $589 billion in the company’s market value. In a statement, Nvidia called DeepSeek’s model an “excellent AI advancement” that actually does use “significant numbers” of Nvidia’s GPUs, but they’re less powerful ones made for use in China that are “fully export control compliant.” Nvidia wasn’t the only company to see a big loss on Monday driven by DeepSeek. Chipmakers Broadcom saw a 17% one-day drop, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, whose stock fell 13%, were also hurt by the news. The markets slowly began recovering Tuesday, but increases were more gradual. There’s long been speculation that AI companies were becoming overvalued. Nvidia rocketed from a company that made graphics cards for video games to the leading player in AI hardware—and now with eyes on self-driving cars, robotics and smart warehouses—in a matter of years, and has at times been the world’s most valuable company. While Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Meta and Apple have several other services, company progress on AI has played an outsized role as in how their shares have performed. And private companies including OpenAI—valued at $157 billion—and Anthropic—worth $6 billion after a pending $2 billion funding round is finalized—are pulling in dollars and influence. According to Crunchbase, close to a third of all global venture funding in 2024 went to companies in AI-related fields, totaling more than $100 billion. Is this the beginning of the burst of the AI bubble? It could be. Before DeepSeek impacted U.S. markets, Forbes contributor Abdo Riani compared AI to the tech bubble a generation ago, when early dot-com companies quickly went from ballooning fortunes to struggling to keep the lights on. The dot-com bubble was fueled by investor over-optimism in the power of the internet, overlooking rational considerations of what the technology could do and deliver. The companies that survived the bubble’s burst, including Amazon, Google and eBay, Riani wrote, used the technology to bring specific values and usage to the technology. The stock market leader of two years from now may be a company that can use AI to make a difference through AI-powered agents, or mostly autonomous robots and vehicles. But maybe it will still be Nvidia, which will continue creating the hardware for AI, and has a good track record of recovering from drastic swings in its value. The CFO’s role in a company is always evolving. I talked to Megan Weis, vice president and general manager of finance & accounting outsourcing services at finance talent company Personiv, and host of a weekly CFO podcast, about the changes she’s seeing in the job. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. President Donald Trump speaks at a White House news conference last week. Taxes are important to Donald Trump, and he’s pressing forward with remaking the IRS in his policy likeness. Former IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel officially left the department on January 20, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb, clearing a path for Trump nominee Billy Long to take over. IRS commissioners serve five-year terms and are generally not replaced as administrations change. Werfel’s term wasn’t up until late 2027. No confirmation hearings appear to be scheduled for Long, a former congressman and Trump loyalist with no direct background in tax policy. Among his day one executive orders, Trump put a 90-day federal hiring freeze in place throughout the government so the new Department of Government Efficiency could figure out the correct size of the government workforce. However, the IRS hiring freeze seems more permanent, and will remain in place until the Treasury secretary determines it’s in the national interest to lift it, Phillips Erb writes. Biden boosted the IRS’s personnel funding in order to provide better and faster service to taxpayers, as well as to pursue high-wealth individuals, large corporations and complex partnerships to ensure they are paying their fair share. In November and December 2023, the IRS offered positions to more than 560 new accountants. This week, Phillips Erb writes, job offers have been rescinded to job candidates with start dates after February 8. Trump has also talked about firing existing IRS employees, aiming at the 87,000 new IRS workers—for positions ranging from customer service and IT to enforcement—that would be hired over the next decade through 2023’s Inflation Reduction Act. “They hired, or tried to hire, 88,000 workers to go after you and we're in the process of developing a plan to either terminate all of them, or maybe we'll move them to the border,” he told a crowd last week at the Circa Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, Phillips Erb reported. While Trump passed large tax cuts in his first term and has said extending—or even increasing—them is a priority in his second, Republicans in Congress are hashing out the best way to do that. Trump has said he wants everything in one bill so it’s easier to get everything that is wanted. The Senate confirmed Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary on Monday, so the leadership to enact those cuts is now in place. As far as international taxes, Trump also issued a memo saying that any commitment made under the Biden administration to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development with respect to the Global Tax Deal will not be followed. The OECD determines how international corporations are taxed by all countries, and Trump’s memo says that Congress will work toward a more America first tax policy, Phillips Erb writes. A Costco store in Richmond, California. As some companies rein in their diversity, equity and inclusion efforts—last week, Target joined the list of companies scaling back policies to increase hiring and promotions of people of color and women—others are doubling down on them. Costco’s shareholders almost unanimously bucked a challenge to its diversity policies, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The National Center for Public Policy Research had petitioned the retailer to audit the company’s “litigation, reputational and financial risks” caused by its DEI policies. Costco’s leadership rejected the proposal last month and urged shareholders to vote it down, saying that the retailer regularly evaluates its policies. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also stood firm in his commitment to DEI initiatives, saying, “Bring them on” in an interview with CNBC last week, Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly writes. However, business DEI policies may be thrust in an uncomfortable spotlight by Trump, who opposes the policy. He signed a day one executive order ending federal DEI programs, saying that the “illegal and immoral” plans “demonstrated immense public waste and shameful discrimination.” Another executive order brings this crackdown to the private sector by rescinding a 1965 anti-discrimination order for federal contractors from President Lyndon B. Johnson. Trump is now requiring agencies to identify contractors who use “coded or imprecise language” to “obscure” DEI initiatives, as well as identifying up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of private sector entities “to deter DEI programs or principles…that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.” The attorney general will take this information and issue a report of recommendations to take action within 120 days. The fuselage and one of the engines of a Boeing 777-9 jetliner aircraft on the tarmac at Dubai World Central - Al-Maktoum International Airport. With a shocking in-flight plane malfunction, a rejected plea deal for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, and a seven-week machinists strike halting production, Boeing had a terrible 2024—posting a stunning $11.8 billion loss. But, Forbes’ Jeremy Bogaisky writes, that’s actually part of a pattern for Boeing. The aircraft company is on a six-year losing streak, and is likely to have lost a total of $35.7 billion in that time period. Forbes senior contributor Jim Osman writes that activist investors—including investment titan Warren Buffett—may be looking closely at Boeing as a potential target. Personiv Vice President and General Manager of Finance & Accounting Outsourcing Services Megan Weis. As vice president and general manager of finance & accounting outsourcing services at finance talent company Personiv, Megan Weis has her finger on the pulse of how the CFO’s profession is changing. She also talks with different CFOs about their work in her CFO Weekly podcast. I talked to her about the CFO’s evolution in 2025. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How do you see the CFO’s role continuing to evolve in 2025? Weis: I can’t have a conversation these days without hearing about generative AI. It’s still pretty nascent. Most smaller to mid-size companies are experimenting with some things here and there at the moment, whereas enterprise companies are using it to turn data into actionable insights. Technology is going to continue to evolve. Cybersecurity is becoming a huge issue these days, and CFOs are becoming more and more responsible for managing that risk. Hackers are becoming more clever, and the risks are just becoming more and more. Globally, it’s becoming very unstable. We have supply chain issues, there are currency fluctuations, inflationary concerns. It’s becoming more complex. Soft skills are becoming and more and more of a requirement. The CFO role is like a ringleader; it’s very collaborative. The CFO is becoming more responsible for communicating across the organization, and that ties back to the idea of being the storyteller. With so much data out there, it’s becoming increasingly necessary to digest that data, turn it into actionable insights, and be able to communicate it back to the organization in a way that finance or non-finance and accounting people can understand, whether that be employees or investors. How did the evolution to CFO-as-storyteller begin, and what stories can the CFO tell that a company would miss otherwise? It started when the CFO role started gearing toward being more of a strategic role, or a right hand to the CEO. The CFO is becoming more responsible for bridging the gap between finance and other departments. They’re responsible for collaborating. A lot of them throughout their career are stepping out of finance for a time and concentrating more in operational areas. [It’s important] being able to communicate to investors [and] employees, and really humanizing financial data. At this point, there’s just so much data that's available to finance and accounting and the CFO that you really have to take that data, boil it down, digest it, tell a story with it, and then align that story with the culture and the objectives of the organization. In general, the world is looking for more transparency. They’re looking for organizations who stand for something, and that’s part of where the storytelling comes in. People want to work for organizations that are purpose-driven and where the stories align, whether that be the stories they’re trying to sell to investors or the story that their financial data is telling. Transparency is becoming more and more critical. Historically, CFOs have been more of a news reporter. They’ve taken historical data and regurgitated it back to investors and companies, whereas today, they’re more forward-looking, more strategic. They still have to get the numbers, but they’re helping to shape the story more than just report the news. How do fractional CFOs work, and how often are they being used? Fractional CFOs are something that I hadn’t really heard about before I’d started this podcast. I do think that they are becoming more prevalent. They’ve grown over the last decade or so, and they’re being used a lot for small and mid-size businesses who can’t afford a full-time CFO, but still need the guidance of someone with experience being a CFO. The fractional CFO plays really well into the gig economy: People wanting a portfolio of work, and maybe not just relying on one employee to be their employee for their entire career. That’s not the way things work anymore. An employe[r] might not hold on to you for your entire career. Building a portfolio of clients for CFOs is the route that they want to go. Also, with more PE-backed companies, those PE firms are looking for CFOs, and someone with the experience of a CFO to help make strategic decisions for those organizations, help guide them through growth periods. I also think fractional CFOs play a big part in a company being able to be agile and pull in experts when those experts are needed. Every company goes through different stages, whether that be growth or crisis, and I think the fractional CFO allows those small companies to be agile and pull in the right talent when it’s needed. Unionized employees at Costco voted to go on strike when their contract expires on January 31. The company has rejected union proposals for increased seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time and safeguards against surveillance. 18,000: Number of Costco employees represented by the Teamsters union—about 8% of the warehouse retailer’s full workforce 26%: Costco’s profit growth since the current union contract, signed in 2022 ‘Costco claims to treat workers better than the competition, but right now, it’s failing to live up to that reputation’: Tom Erickson, director of the Teamsters Warehouse Division, said in a statement To be a leader that employees, colleagues and investors trust, it’s important to be authentic.

Microsoft (MSFT) reported its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines but falling short on estimates for its Intelligent Cloud business. Microsoft stock fell 6% after the market opened Thursday on the news. Microsoft’s Commercial Cloud segment revenue, which includes cloud services sales, saw revenue of $40 billion, a 21% year-over-year increase but shy of Wall Street expectations of $41.1 billion. Microsoft's intelligent cloud business, which includes its Azure platform, saw revenue of $25.5 billion. Wall Street was expecting $25.8 billion. The company said it saw 13 percentage points of growth in Azure from AI services. Cloud gross margin, however, decreased to 70% on the company's artificial intelligence build-out. “We are innovating across our tech stack and helping customers unlock the full ROI of AI to capture the massive opportunity ahead," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. “Already, our AI business has surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion, up 175% year-over-year.” During the company's earnings call, Microsoft said its Intelligent Cloud revenue for the current quarter would land between $25.9 billion and $26.2 billion, sending shares lower. The earnings announcement comes as Wall Street continues to digest the fallout surrounding DeepSeek’s impact on the AI industry and Silicon Valley’s tech titans. Microsoft and its Big Tech cohort are investing tens of billions of dollars in AI data centers, with Microsoft saying it plans to spend $80 billion in fiscal 2025 alone. But China's DeepSeek sent a jolt through the tech sector, saying it trained its AI model on systems that use less power than leading AI chips and at a fraction of the price of those produced by American rivals like Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). That has investors questioning whether Silicon Valley is making the right investments. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, however, attempted to downplay any fears saying that the company’s fleet of data centers is “fungible” and that its investments help the company scale long-term business. “The big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that [are] the customers,” he said. For the quarter, Microsoft reported earnings per share (EPS) of $3.23 on revenue of $69.6 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $3.13 on revenue of $68.8 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported EPS of $2.93 on revenue of $62 billion in the same quarter last year. While Microsoft is one of the main beneficiaries of the AI boom, its stock price has lagged behind the competition. Shares of Microsoft were up just 5% over the last 12 months as of Monday, while Amazon (AMZN) and Google shares were up 44% and 26%, respectively. Microsoft is also seeking to jump-start PC sales via its Copilot+ PC lineup. The idea is that AI PCs will be able to run AI applications natively rather than via the cloud. But so far, there aren’t very many intriguing scenarios in which those applications make upgrading worthwhile. Hardware updates like improved performance and power are still the main reason consumers want new PCs. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Microsoft (MSFT) will report its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday as Wall Street continues to digest the fallout surrounding DeepSeek’s impact on the AI industry and Silicon Valley’s tech titans. Microsoft and its Big Tech cohort are investing tens of billions of dollars in the data centers and infrastructure needed to train and deploy AI software across their various services. But China’s DeepSeek upended the general thinking that developing AI models requires the use of the most powerful, and expensive, chips with the release of its R1 model on Jan. 20. The model, the company claims, was trained on systems that were less powerful and less expensive than those produced by American rivals like Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). The company’s app shot to the top of the App Store over the weekend, driving a huge amount of interest in the relatively small firm and clobbering American AI stocks, including AI bellwether Nvidia. Now Microsoft will have to prove not only that its own AI work is paying off in terms of increased revenue but also that its hefty infrastructure investments are truly necessary. For the quarter, Microsoft is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $3.13 on revenue of $68.8 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported EPS of $2.93 on revenue of $62 billion in the same quarter last year. Importantly, Microsoft’s Commercial Cloud segment revenue, which includes cloud services sales, is expected to come in at $41.1 billion. That would be an increase from the $31.9 billion the company reported in Q2 last year. Its intelligent cloud business, which includes its Azure platform, is set to come in at $25.8 billion, up from $21.5 billion.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Microsoft (MSFT) will report its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday as Wall Street continues to digest the fallout surrounding DeepSeek’s impact on the AI industry and Silicon Valley’s tech titans. Microsoft and its Big Tech cohort are investing tens of billions of dollars in the data centers and infrastructure needed to train and deploy AI software across their various services. But China’s DeepSeek upended the general thinking that developing AI models requires the use of the most powerful, and expensive, chips with the release of its R1 model on Jan. 20. The model, the company claims, was trained on systems that were less powerful and less expensive than those produced by American rivals like Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). The company’s app shot to the top of the App Store over the weekend, driving a huge amount of interest in the relatively small firm and clobbering American AI stocks, including AI bellwether Nvidia. Now Microsoft will have to prove not only that its own AI work is paying off in terms of increased revenue but also that its hefty infrastructure investments are truly necessary. For the quarter, Microsoft is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $3.13 on revenue of $68.8 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported EPS of $2.93 on revenue of $62 billion in the same quarter last year. Importantly, Microsoft’s Commercial Cloud segment revenue, which includes cloud services sales, is expected to come in at $41.1 billion. That would be an increase from the $31.9 billion the company reported in Q2 last year. Its intelligent cloud business, which includes its Azure platform, is set to come in at $25.8 billion, up from $21.5 billion.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Microsoft (MSFT) reported its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines but falling short on estimates for its Intelligent Cloud business. Microsoft stock fell 6% after the market opened Thursday on the news. Microsoft’s Commercial Cloud segment revenue, which includes cloud services sales, saw revenue of $40 billion, a 21% year-over-year increase but shy of Wall Street expectations of $41.1 billion. Microsoft's intelligent cloud business, which includes its Azure platform, saw revenue of $25.5 billion. Wall Street was expecting $25.8 billion. The company said it saw 13 percentage points of growth in Azure from AI services. Cloud gross margin, however, decreased to 70% on the company's artificial intelligence build-out. “We are innovating across our tech stack and helping customers unlock the full ROI of AI to capture the massive opportunity ahead," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. “Already, our AI business has surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion, up 175% year-over-year.” During the company's earnings call, Microsoft said its Intelligent Cloud revenue for the current quarter would land between $25.9 billion and $26.2 billion, sending shares lower. The earnings announcement comes as Wall Street continues to digest the fallout surrounding DeepSeek’s impact on the AI industry and Silicon Valley’s tech titans. Microsoft and its Big Tech cohort are investing tens of billions of dollars in AI data centers, with Microsoft saying it plans to spend $80 billion in fiscal 2025 alone. But China's DeepSeek sent a jolt through the tech sector, saying it trained its AI model on systems that use less power than leading AI chips and at a fraction of the price of those produced by American rivals like Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). That has investors questioning whether Silicon Valley is making the right investments. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, however, attempted to downplay any fears saying that the company’s fleet of data centers is “fungible” and that its investments help the company scale long-term business. “The big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that [are] the customers,” he said. For the quarter, Microsoft reported earnings per share (EPS) of $3.23 on revenue of $69.6 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $3.13 on revenue of $68.8 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported EPS of $2.93 on revenue of $62 billion in the same quarter last year. While Microsoft is one of the main beneficiaries of the AI boom, its stock price has lagged behind the competition. Shares of Microsoft were up just 5% over the last 12 months as of Monday, while Amazon (AMZN) and Google shares were up 44% and 26%, respectively.

Title: “DEEP-CRASH!”
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/deep-crash/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T15:05:49Z
Full Content:
By Greg Guenthner Posted January 28, 2025 The opening salvo of a hot artificial intelligence battle just dumped a bucket of cold water on the stock market. Big Tech spiraled lower to kick off the trading week after a Chinese AI firm called DeepSeek made huge waves in the industry. The ten-second version of this story is DeepSeek can do everything the other major AI firms can do, and more — all for a fraction of the cost, time, and equipment. As far as I can tell, there’s still plenty of arguing about the details of just how powerful this thing is by folks a lot smarter and more tech-savvy than me. The first rumblings of DeepSeek’s amazing achievements hit the market Friday, causing scattered selling in chip king Nvidia Corp. (NVDA). Shares ended the day down more than 3%. Not a great day — but also not the end of the world, as NVDA was able to post its second straight week of gains. But tech investors became noticeably nervous Sunday evening. By Monday morning, the DeepDeek fiasco sparked a mini-panic that ripped through the semiconductors and tech at large. The Nasdaq Composite gapped down nearly 3.5% to kick off the new trading week, while NVDA steadily dropped all morning, losing 17% by the closing bell. NVDA isn’t the only casualty of the DeepSeek crash. Speculators dumped their Big Tech shares, Bitcoin, and anything even remotely associated with the AI boom. The financial media wasted no time playing up the ugly numbers. Bloomberg was one of the first to note that the NVDA rout was the biggest in market history. “Nvidia shares tumbled as much as 18% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020,” Bloomberg reports. “In early afternoon trading in New York, the decline erased $560 billion from the company’s market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record — a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value — and was the biggest in US stock-market history.” What Bloomberg failed to note in its headline (and what is obvious from the above graph) is that due to its sheer size, NVDA’s notable drops during its incredible two-year rally make up 80% of the biggest single-day market-cap losses in history. The lesson: big numbers are big! Plus, these huge drops didn’t stop the stock from rallying more than 1,200% off its 2022 bear market lows. In case those gains fail to impress you, please note that yesterday’s drop shoved NVDA below its 200-day moving average for the first time in two years. I know it’s all too easy to get sucked into the bearish narrative after watching yesterday’s action unfold. But instead of focusing on the hundreds of billions in market cap that disappeared, I’m far more interested in what the rest of the market has to say in reaction to the NVDA situation. We’ve already witnessed the premarket panic, NVDA dropping double-digits, and other big tech names falling in sympathy. And while most market-watchers are hung up on hoping and praying NVDA catches a bid off these panic lows, we can use the confusion to our advantage. For starters, I’m keeping an eye on tech names that have little involvement in the AI ecosystem. While the Nasdaq Composite finished lower by more than 3% on Monday, more than 1,600 components finished the day in positive territory. Of these stocks, 150 gained more than 5%. Sharp declines in NVDA, ORCL, AVGO, MSFT, GOOG, and TSLA masked many of the positives happening under the surface. Then there are stocks outside of the tech sphere (Yes, they exist!)… Perhaps you’ve heard of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Big Board had a big day Monday. While everyone was sweating NVDA, the Dow posted a modest gain of 0.65%. But here’s the kicker: Every single stock in the Dow finished the day in the green. This looks more like a rotation than a selloff. While investors are ditching NVDA, they’re clearly putting money work elsewhere. Consumer staples, discretionary, and financials all managed to post gains yesterday. Finally, is the DeepSeek revelation a catalyst for a major trend reversal in China? The iShares China Large-cap ETF (FXI) posted a gain of almost 1% on Monday while the American tech sector faltered. At this point, we don’t know how much of the DeepSeek news is hype, panic, or somewhere in between. But investors are reacting favorably to Chinese names. Remember, these stocks have been a sloppy mess for years. They stopped going down as of early last year and have been trying to produce a steady uptrend ever since. We’ll see if this news is a game changer and leads to a bigger move higher in FXI. NVDA is not the stock market – no matter how much the financial media insists otherwise. Judging by Monday’s action, we’ll have little trouble finding viable trade ideas outside of the AI trainwreck. We might even get a reprieve from AI insanity thanks to a slew of tech earnings hitting later this week. TSLA, META, MSFT, IBM, and NOW report on Wednesday afternoon. AAPL and INTC follow on Thursday afternoon. If these aren’t enough distractions for you, we also have a Fed meeting and rate decision on Wednesday, GDP Thursday, and this morning’s durable orders to dissect. The market tends to have a short memory during busy trading periods. With a full slate scheduled this week, the NVDA strife could fall off the front page faster than you could imagine…

Title: Why Dell Technologies Stock Is Down 9% In A Day?

POLAND - 2025/01/11: In this photo illustration, a Dell logo seen displayed on a smartphone. (Photo ... [+] Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE: DELL) suffered a 9% stock drop on Monday, January 27, amid concerns sparked by DeepSeek’s affordable AI chatbot. This emerging technology has disrupted the industry, posing a significant threat to U.S. tech leaders and raising questions about the long-term viability of AI infrastructure investments. Nvidia’s stock(NASDAQ: NVDA) also felt the ripple effect, and plummeted 17% on the same day. See Why Is DeepSeek Sinking Nvidia Stock? Chinese AI DeepSeek has open-sourced its R1 model, which has been shown to outperform leading models from OpenAI and Meta in various benchmarks. What’s more, this breakthrough technology is not only freely available but also offers a cost-efficient solution that requires fewer computing resources, making it an attractive proposition for the industry. The situation could have particular significance for Dell’s stock, as they’ve emerged as a key player in AI servers. Dell’s revenue streams are diversified, with roughly half derived from personal computers (PCs) sales and related products, while the remaining half comes from its robust infrastructure business, including servers, where the company holds a dominant market position. While Dell’s Q3 sales grew 10% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $24.4 billion, the company’s client solutions group experienced a 1% y-o-y decline in revenue to $12.1 billion. Consumer sales within this segment plummeted 18% y-o-y. However, Dell’s infrastructure business emerged as a bright spot, growing 34% y-o-y to $11.4 billion - with server and networking revenue surging 58% y-o-y to $7.4 billion. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Dell’s investment in AI servers is poised to drive substantial growth in its infrastructure business, as the AI server market is projected to exceed $200 billion by 2029. While AI-powered servers are typically low-margin, the sheer scale of the market presents a compelling growth opportunity. This growth will likely be complemented by increasing revenue from AI-optimized PC sales on the consumer side. While Dell’s revenues may be held back somewhat by the struggling PC segment, a substantial PC upgrade cycle is anticipated in 2025. The current economic climate and rising inflation have led to delayed tech upgrades. However, the availability of AI-enabled PCs, combined with the impending end of Windows 10 support in October 2025, may prompt consumers to upgrade their machines to leverage next-generation technologies and ensure ongoing security updates. With AI empowering both legitimate users and hackers, the need for enhanced protection may further incentivize upgrades. Dell’s stock valuation remains relatively modest, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 12, suggesting that the shares may still be undervalued. However, with the rise of DeepSeek, the investors are now concerned that the sales growth may be slower than anticipated. DELL stock has seen a 38% rise since the beginning of 2024, significantly outperforming the broader S&P500 index, up 26%. Returns for the stock were 52% in 2021, -27% in 2022, 96% in 2023, and 53% in 2024. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In conclusion, Dell’s attractive valuation, robust server and networking sales, and the impending PC refresh cycle position the company for potential outperformance, making it a compelling AI stock pick for 2025 and beyond. However, investors should exercise caution, as Dell’s business remains vulnerable to macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting industry trends.

Title: Buy These High Yield CEF Dividends To Hedge Against Market Volatility

investment analysis inflation economic chart With the new administration now in full swing, market events are coming our way at a furious pace, especially for our high yield CEFs. One thing that’s clear about the next few years? Volatility is likely to tick up, especially with stock valuations stretched. Now more than ever, we need to be diversified, so we’re set up to offset any shocks to any one sector while we collect our high closed-end fund dividends. So that’s what we’re going to do today. And CEFs are the best tool to do it. Through just three funds (see tickers below), we’ll give ourselves access to some of the top blue-chip stocks, real estate investment trusts and high-yield bonds out there. Better still (for safety, as well as income), we’ll get a big slice of our return as dividends, as these three funds pay an 8.8% average yield between them. That’s about seven times what the average S&P 500 stock pays. Plus, these yields are sustainable. To say that this “dividend difference” is a big deal is an understatement. Consider a million-dollar portfolio put into the S&P 500 versus these three funds. That’d get you about $1,008 per month with the index, which no one can live on anymore. But that same amount in this three-fund portfolio gets you $7,333 per month — more than the average monthly paycheck in America. Let’s see how these funds’ high-quality assets help sustain those payouts. Their bargain valuations help out a bit on the dividend front, too. A great place to start is with the Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX). I say that because this CEF should appeal to anyone who currently holds an S&P 500 index fund, since its mandate is to buy all of the stocks in that index. That means you’ll get names like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Visa (V), Bank of America (BAC) and other well-known reliable performers that form the backbone of the economy. They’ve helped SPXX deliver strong long-term gains. At the same time, SPXX yields 7.5%, while S&P 500 index funds yield just around 1.2%. That higher yield comes from two major sources. The first is SPXX’s covered-call-option strategy, in which it sells contracts to investors who pay for the privilege of buying the fund’s stocks at a future date at a predetermined amount. SPXX then hands the cash it receives for selling these option contracts to investors as dividends. Second, SPXX will occasionally sell certain holdings and hand the profits to investors, again in the form of dividends. That means you don’t have to worry about buying or selling your shares to rebalance your position. Just let the income flow your way as the managers do all the work. There’s a third reason why that yield is so big, and that’s one of the really cool things about SPXX and CEFs like it. SPXX trades at a 5.8% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) as I write this, so we’re getting a bargain that ETF buyers simply don’t have access to. This also means that management can pay out that 7.5% dividend, based on the market price of SPXX, while earning just 7.1% from its NAV, or portfolio value. Remember that the S&P 500 has returned 10% per year on average, so that 7.1% profit per year should be easy for SPXX to achieve. The Cohen & Steers Quality Income Realty Fund (RQI) is a real estate focused CEF that I talk about a lot, for a simple reason: Its management has a proven track record of picking the best REITs. Cohen & Steers has 39 years of experience managing real estate assets for clients and manages over $100 billion in assets. RQI’s yield is also 7.5%, which is pretty easy for the fund to deliver, since management’s annualized returns since RQI’s 2002 inception has been 9.1%. RQI trades around the par value of its portfolio now, but there’s a good reason why. Returns from the fund’s portfolio nicely cover its dividend. It also holds REITs from various industries and regions, so we can look at it as a kind of “one-stop shop” for REIT investing. (RQI also holds a small lot of high-yielding preferred shares.) If that weren’t enough, RQI invests in over 200 real estate assets, most of which are stocks in REITs that themselves manage hundreds (or in some cases thousands) of individual properties. Top holdings include cell-tower REIT American Tower (AMT), warehouse giant Prologis (PLD) and data-center landlord Equinix (EQIX). That’s unparalleled diversification, with a leaning toward some of the most in-demand real estate in the US. That gives us extra reassurance as we collect RQI’s 7.5% payout. Now let’s boost the income stream on this “mini-portfolio” with the PIMCO Access Income Fund (PAXS), whose 11.4% income stream is enormous, but also sustainable. And there’s a simple reason why. High Yield Bond Yields Above we see the average yield for high-yield corporate bonds, which has hovered around 7% since early 2022. Note that Fed rate cuts have pushed that average lower over the last year and a half. This matters for PAXS, a buy recommendation of my CEF Insider service, because the fund invests in bonds similar to those in this index, or “bond-like” assets that are fairly comparable. It has also been collecting that income, which it has been handing over to investors as cash dividends. Since the average effective maturity for the bonds in PAXS’s portfolio is now 6.3 years, that means it’s effectively secured bonds at these high yields to fund payments to investors for many years to come. But you might be thinking, that’s 7%, which is far below the 11.4% PAXS pays out. While that’s true, remember that the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates over those six years, which will boost the value of PAXS’ bonds (since they pay out more than newly issued bonds would). As that happens, PAXS can sell those bonds at a profit and hand that over to investors as dividends. Now this fund does trade at a slight premium (3.4%) to NAV, but that’s actually a bargain for a fund from PIMCO, which is a revered name among CEF investors. PIMCO funds often trade at premiums—and those premiums regularly stretch into double digits. These three funds together get us an 8.8%-yielding portfolio with a nice mix of stocks, bonds and REITs. And since you can buy all three of these CEFs through any stock brokerage (CEFs are bought and sold like stocks over exchanges like the NYSE), this is an easy way to diversify across hundreds of assets all at once.

This matters for PAXS, a buy recommendation of my CEF Insider service, because the fund invests in bonds similar to those in this index, or “bond-like” assets that are fairly comparable. It has also been collecting that income, which it has been handing over to investors as cash dividends. Since the average effective maturity for the bonds in PAXS’s portfolio is now 6.3 years, that means it’s effectively secured bonds at these high yields to fund payments to investors for many years to come. But you might be thinking, that’s 7%, which is far below the 11.4% PAXS pays out. While that’s true, remember that the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates over those six years, which will boost the value of PAXS’ bonds (since they pay out more than newly issued bonds would). As that happens, PAXS can sell those bonds at a profit and hand that over to investors as dividends. Now this fund does trade at a slight premium (3.4%) to NAV, but that’s actually a bargain for a fund from PIMCO, which is a revered name among CEF investors. PIMCO funds often trade at premiums—and those premiums regularly stretch into double digits. These three funds together get us an 8.8%-yielding portfolio with a nice mix of stocks, bonds and REITs. And since you can buy all three of these CEFs through any stock brokerage (CEFs are bought and sold like stocks over exchanges like the NYSE), this is an easy way to diversify across hundreds of assets all at once.

Title: How DeepSeek’s AI Model Impacts AVGO Stock?

CANADA - 2025/01/06: In this photo illustration, the Broadcom company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO), a semiconductor, enterprise software, and security solutions provider, saw its stock plunge over 17% on Monday, January 27. This can be attributed to the ripples DeepSeek created, sending tremors through the Silicon Valley. DeepSeek’s more efficient approach challenges the conventional wisdom that bigger and more expensive necessarily means better in AI development. The Chinese AI lab DeepSeek recently made waves by releasing their DeepSeek-R1 model as open-source software. What makes this noteworthy is that according to the lab’s research, DeepSeek-R1 achieves better performance than prominent models like OpenAI’s o1 and Meta’s Llama across various metrics. The model stands out not just for its performance, but also because it’s freely available, cost-efficient, and demands less computing resources than competitors. This development has caused concerns in the west, where major tech companies have typically focused on a resource-intensive approach — accumulating massive amounts of computing infrastructure. The situation could have particular significance for Broadcom’s stock, as they’ve emerged as a key player in AI networking technology. But also see DeepSeek Could Boost Intel Stock. Broadcom’s revenue of 51.6 billion in fiscal 2024 (fiscal ends in October) was up a stellar 44% y-o-y. This can partly be attributed to the contribution from VMware, which it acquired for $69 billion in late 2023. Apart from VMware, Broadcom’s AI products contributed to its top-line growth. The company’s AI revenue in fiscal 2024 stood at $12.2 billion, reflecting a whopping 220% y-o-y growth, driven by strong demand for its AI XPUs (Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators) and Ethernet products. Broadcom is benefiting from the generative AI boom, with its wide suite of networking and storage solutions, cybersecurity, and semiconductor offerings. Broadcom also announced that it’s developing AI chips with three large cloud companies, which reportedly include Google and Meta. Broadcom’s business relies heavily on their networking products, which are crucial for data transfer in AI systems. If the market for premium AI chips experiences a downturn, amid the rise of DeepSeek, it could create a domino effect, potentially hurting sales of Broadcom’s supporting technologies and components. Investors have assigned a higher valuation multiple for AVGO stock, taking into account the expected AI contribution. With the rise of DeepSeek, the investors are now concerned about the sales growth may be slower than earlier anticipated. AVGO stock has seen a solid 84% rise since the beginning of 2024, significantly outperforming the broader S&P500 index, up 26%. Admirably, AVGO stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last four years. Returns for the stock were 56% in 2021, -13% in 2022, 104% in 2023, and 110% in 2024. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, with changes in the White House, and the DeepSeek update, could AVGO see a strong jump? We think that investors should tread with caution. This potential shift in the industry toward efficiency over raw power, combined with a broader slowdown, could create additional challenges for Broadcom’s business prospects. While AVGO stock took a plunge amid the rise of DeepSeek, it is helpful to see how Broadcom’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) is advancing 3% this morning after plunging nearly 17% yesterday. The rebound came after JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on NVDA today. Why JPMorgan Remains Bullish on NVDA Noting that Chinese startup DeepSeek reported that it had trained an AI model for a very low price of about $5.6 million, JPMorgan asserted that this news is actually positive for chip makers. Specifically, according to the bank, when computing products become less costly to manufacture historically, the demand for chips and the consumption of more expensive chips have increased. The latter trend should play out going forward in the AI chip market, JPMorgan asserted. Further, the bank wrote that some information about DeepSeek's model has not been provided. For example, the total cost of all training sessions may not have been included in the $5.6 million total, and the degree to which the start-up used existing open-source models was not disclosed, JPMorgan stated. “We believe it is crucial to validate these costs before drawing conclusions,” the bank wrote. The Recent Price Action of NVDA Stock In the last month heading into today, the shares had dropped 12%, while they had pulled back 16% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose nearly 9% Tuesday as the AI chipmaker began to recover from a massive decline the prior day that shaved nearly $600 billion off its market cap. Nvidia’s 17% freefall Monday was prompted by investor anxieties related to a new, cost-effective artificial intelligence model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. Some Wall Street analysts worried that the cheaper costs DeepSeek claimed to have spent training its latest AI models, due in part to using fewer AI chips, meant US firms were overspending on artificial intelligence infrastructure. That created a concern among the investment community that Nvidia’s high GPU (graphics processing unit, or AI chip) prices could come under pressure and that demand for semiconductors could wane. Nvidia’s $589 billion market cap decline was the largest single-day loss in stock market history. The DeepSeek announcements drove down not only Nvidia but the market at large, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropping 3%. Chip stocks dropped across the board Monday, but some names began to recover. After dropping more than 17% to start the week, Broadcom (AVGO) rose 2.6% Tuesday. Nvidia itself didn’t express much anxiety over the DeepSeek buzz, calling R1 "an excellent AI advancement" in a statement Monday. Wall Street analysts continued to reflect on the DeepSeek-fueled market rout Tuesday, expressing skepticism over DeepSeek’s reportedly low costs to train its AI models and the implications for AI stocks. JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur and Citi analyst Christopher Danley said in separate notes to investors that because DeepSeek used a process called “distillation” — in other words, it relied on Meta’s (META) open-source Llama AI model to develop its model — the low spending cited by the Chinese startup (under $6 billion to train its recent V3 model) did not fully encompass its costs. “We believe it is crucial to validate these costs before drawing conclusions,” Sur wrote. Danley added: “Given Deepseek is based on leveraging cloud service providers [Meta] and AI is still in its infancy, we lean towards the argument of continued strong growth in AI spending.” Even so, DeepSeek “clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as US hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri wrote in a note to investors Monday.

Title: DeepSeek is the 'Temu of AI,' analysts say

After traders sold off global technology stocks en masse Monday on news of a Chinese artificial intelligence competitor, some aren’t too concerned with DeepSeek’s seemingly meteoric rise. Analysts at Wedbush, led by Dan Ives, said in a note Tuesday that they “view the DeepSeek fear across the tech world as in essence a ‘tech AI head fake’ that will be short lived as more details and analysis comes out about DeepSeek’s model and China resources.” The sell-off led to a $1 trillion loss in market capitalization, with much of that driven by heavy bleeding in the tech sector. Nvidia (NVDA-1.25%) alone, which closed down 17% on Monday, shed $600 billion in market value — the largest single-day loss of any company in U.S. history. It ended the day with a share price of $118.68, bringing its market cap to $2.9 trillion. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 2% in pre-market trading. Contracts for major U.S. indices were relatively flat early Tuesday. Traders fled the tech sector in response to Chinese firm DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META+1.62%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.34%) App Store over the weekend. Some analysts warned that DeepSeek’s model, which was built using less energy and with lower cost chips, could pose a threat to U.S. dominance of AI development. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. It also said it built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. But Wedbush said it’s not worried about DeepSeek disrupting the planned $2 trillion in capital expenditures expected on AI in the coming years. “DeepSeek created an awesome LLM model (and credit to its software developers) however this Chinese AI small lab/LLM model is not bringing down the entire US tech ecosystem with it,” the analysts wrote. “Just like Temu was the ‘Amazon (AMZN-0.84%) model destroyer’ a few years ago... Amazon’s team adjusted and now look,” they said, referring it to the Chinese-origin e-commerce company that was feared to pose a major threat to competitors with its rock-bottom prices.

Title: Trump says DeepSeek's AI bombshell should be a 'wake-up call' for Big Tech

The release of DeepSeek-R1, a new open-source reasoning model from a Chinese artificial intelligence startup, should be a “wake-up call” for the U.S. tech industry, President Donald Trump said. While speaking at a gathering of House Republican lawmakers on Monday night in Miami, Trump called for American tech companies to be “laser-focused” on competing with rivals like DeepSeek. “When you hear a DeepSeek, when you hear somebody — somebody come up with something, we always have the ideas. We’re always first,” Trump said at the event. “So, I would say that’s a positive... instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with hopefully the same solution.” DeepSeek in December released a model that it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia (NVDA-1.25%) H800 chips, which have reduced capabilities compared to chips used by U.S. firms. Meanwhile, U.S. rivals such as OpenAI and Meta have touted spending tens of billions on cutting-edge chips from Nvidia. The release of DeepSeek-R1 sparked a global sell-off of tech stocks on Monday. DeepSeek also published a new set of AI models that the company said can outperform OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion Xl. DeepSeek’s Janus-Pro model family is published under a license that allows it to be used commercially without restrictions. Last week, Trump invited executives at OpenAI, Japanese investment bank SoftBank (SFTBY+2.74%), and software company Oracle (ORCL+5.21%) to the White House to announce Stargate, a joint venture that plans to invest $500 billion into AI infrastructure over the next four years. The project is planned to exclusively serve OpenAI, The Financial Times reported. Through a sweeping executive order, Trump has also revoked his predecessor’s 2023 executive order on AI safety and security, which was praised by a trade group representing U.S. tech companies, including Amazon (AMZN-0.84%) and Google (GOOGL+2.70%). He also signed a new order directing a group of White House tech and science officials to develop a new AI action plan within 180 days. “DeepSeek R1 shows that the AI race will be very competitive and that President Trump was right to rescind the Biden EO, which hamstrung American AI companies without asking whether China would do the same,” David Sacks, a venture capitalist and top Trump advisor on cryptocurrency and AI, wrote on X. “I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” he added. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

Nvidia (NVDA-1.25%) stock saw a slight turnaround Tuesday morning after the chipmaker suffered its biggest single-day market value loss because of an artificial intelligence chatbot challenger in China. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 2% in pre-market trading, after closing down almost 17% on Monday, to $118.58. Nvidia shed almost $600 billion in value in a single day, the largest of any U.S. company in history, and lost its spot as the world’s most valuable company, bringing its market capitalization to $2.9 trillion. Other major chip stocks also sank Monday, including ASML (ASML+3.69%), Broadcom (AVGO+4.34%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI+2.21%), Micron (MU+3.54%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+2.58%) That sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 3%. In all, markets saw roughly $1 trillion in market cap loss to start the week. Traders fled the tech sector in response to Chinese firm DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META+1.62%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.34%) App Store over the weekend. Some analysts warned that DeepSeek’s model, which was built using less energy and with lower cost chips, could pose a threat to U.S. dominance of AI development. As its stock plunged, Nvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek is “an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling.” “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking,” a spokesperson said. Markets were relatively flat as of Tuesday morning, with Nasdaq futures up just 0.11%. Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 46 points, and S&P 500 futures ticked up 0.05%. Broadcom also rose almost 3%. The sell-off Monday underscored just how concentrated the market has become. Leaders in the AI and chip space, including the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks, drove much of the market’s returns in 2024. Economists at Goldman Sachs (GS+1.04%) have warned that the “extremely high level of market concentration” poses significant risks to future returns from the broader market. The analysts said the premium valuation for the top 10 stocks is the largest since the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000. These 10 companies, which include Apple, Microsoft (MSFT-6.12%), Amazon (AMZN-0.84%), Nvidia, Alphabet (GOOGL+2.70%), and Meta, accounted for 36% of the S&P 500 and drove much of the index’s returns last year.

Plus: With the release of its fourth quarter losses, Boeing’s financial losing streak now stretches to six years, but the plane maker does have a path toward billions in revenue. Good morning, The debut of a new AI model from China’s DeepSeek sent markets into a frenzy Monday. DeepSeek, which released its open-source models for download in the U.S. earlier this month, surged to the top of the iOS App Store download charts. It’s been compared favorably to products from OpenAI and Meta, while appearing to be more efficient and cost-effective. The competition from the Chinese company spooked investors, tanking the fortunes of several notable billionaires, including Nvidia’s CEO and largest individual shareholder Jensen Huang. Huang’s net worth fell $20.8 billion by market close, and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison lost $27.6 billion, falling from the third-richest person on Earth to fifth. Photo by GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images Markets plunged Monday after the debut of DeepSeek, hitting tech stocks especially hard as the Nasdaq had its fourth-worst day of the last two years. Semiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia plunged 17%, losing $589 billion in market capitalization—by far the single greatest one-day value wipeout of any company in history. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump praised DeepSeek, calling it “a positive development” and a “wake-up call” for U.S. industries. MORE: A Forbes review found the AI model avoids answering questions about topics commonly censored by the Chinese government. Forbes asked DeepSeek five questions on controversial topics, like “What is Taiwan’s status with China?” and “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” Investor interest in the first big IPO of Trump 2.0—liquefied natural gas exporter Venture Global—has been lukewarm. The stock has already fallen nearly 20%, but it still solidifies Venture Global’s place in the public markets with an impressive $50 billion market cap. And the holdings of its cofounders now amount to $20 billion each. Jamel Toppin for Forbes Controversial billionaire Lululemon founder Chip Wilson’s bet on Amer Sports, the parent company of such brands as Arc’teryx and Salomon, appears to be paying off. Wilson, who left his role as Lululemon’s board chair in 2013 following his controversial comments about women’s bodies, sold shares of the company to buy a nearly 21% stake in Amer Sports. That investment is now worth about $3.2 billion, double its value when the company went public in February 2024.

The company said it has a “longstanding practice” of applying name changes when they have been “updated in official government sources.” President Donald Trump signed three executive orders Monday targeting military personnel in an expansion of his crackdown on DEI initiatives. The orders not only rescinded the military’s DEI practices, they also banned transgender individuals from serving, and reinstated service members who were fired for refusing the Covid-19 vaccine. There were around 14,000 transgender service members in the U.S. military as of 2018, according to CNN.

The cheapest seats on Gametime were available for $6,492 per ticket, though Super Bowl tickets typically decline in price in the two weeks leading up to game day. In a memo issued Monday, the acting director of the National Institutes of Health reiterated that the Department of Health and Human Services has “issued a pause” on communications and public appearances by agency staff. But the document also states that clinical trials at the NIH and its funded institutions are ongoing. Still, NIH staffers remain frustrated, with one source saying that “there have never been politics in the NIH. When politics is suddenly becoming involved, that’s where the fear in large part is coming from.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reportedly received guidance to immediately stop working with the World Health Organization, following President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the United Nations agency. While Trump can withdraw the United States from WHO, the U.S. must give a “one-year notice” and meet its financial obligations to the agency for that fiscal year, according to a joint resolution from 1948. The IRS has made moves to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order freezing hiring for most federal agencies. The agency is revoking some job offers and removing job postings. And last week, Trump suggested he might fire IRS employees—or send them to the border. The Boeing logo appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 2020. TOPLINE When it comes to losing money, Boeing is an overperformer—of historic proportion. On Thursday, the beleaguered plane maker pre-announced a net loss of $5.46 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024, which pencils out to about $3.8 billion. That’s a stunning $11.8 billion loss for the year, the second largest in Boeing history. The lousy news is partly due to the disruption of a seven-week strike by Boeing’s machinists that halted production of the company’s bestselling plane, the 737 Max. It’s also a result of costly, chronic delays on key programs in Boeing’s defense division. And then there are the company’s seemingly endless struggles to straighten out production problems with the 737 Max and 787. Boeing’s financial losing streak now stretches six years, starting with the grounding of the 737 Max in 2019 following two deadly crashes. Its total losses since that time: a staggering $35.7 billion. Despite Boeing’s dismal run, institutional investors have been willing to shore up the company’s finances thanks to the company’s fat order book of 5,595 planes, which should convert into billions in revenue if new CEO Kelly Ortberg can get its production lines humming smoothly again. The company raised $24 billion late last year through a sale of stock and convertible debt. WHY IT MATTERS Fourth-quarter earnings season isn’t done yet, but Boeing’s discouraging 2024 results are almost certain to bolster the company’s lead as the biggest loser in the S&P 500 index since 2019, according to data from FactSet. Uber, which was running a close second to Boeing through 2023, is expected to report a profit for 2024. MORE Why Boeing Needs A New Plane — Soon Hosting a Super Bowl party at home will cost roughly the same as last year for a group of 10, according to Wells Fargo’s Super Bowl Food report. The price of some items, like avocados and chicken wings, significantly increased, but they were balanced out by major decreases for chips and certain vegetables: $139: The average cost of a game day gathering featuring fan favorites, just 0.1% more than last year 11.9%: The year-over-year increase in the price of cherry tomatoes, which saw the biggest jump 0.7% to 5.1%: The decline in prices for nacho cheese dip, salsa, tortilla chips and potato chips from 2024 Many organizations struggle with company culture, even as it remains critically important: Employees who feel connected to their organization are four times more likely to be engaged at work, research shows.

Title: AMD Expected To Lose Out On Taiwan Semi Tariffs; Melius Research Thinks NVIDIA Is Going To “Come For Them” Via Arm-based CPUs

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. DeepSeek's R1 AI model seems to have undermined the prevailing narrative around hyperscalers, wounding NVIDIA in the process. Even so, NVIDIA remains the strongest horse in the proverbial stable. As evidence, look no further than AMD, which has just received another downgrade, and that too on a vector wholly unrelated to the ongoing DeepSeek-related saga. Melius Downgrades $AMD to Hold from Buy, Cuts PT to $129 from $160, Cites Increased Pressure on Profit Pools Analyst comments: "We should have done this 10 months ago after an epic run for AMD (up over 40% at one point in 1Q24) - so we better have a reason. Believe it or not,… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) January 28, 2025 To wit, Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes has now downgraded AMD to a 'Hold' rating, while conceding that he should have done so "10 months ago." Reitzes then points out that his AMD downgrade is wholly unrelated to the DeepSeek saga or the likely disappointing 2025 sales numbers for the MI300 GPU: "Believe it or not, it's not due to DeepSeek. We cut numbers already on January 6th on GPUs, and the stock actually went up 3%, so a guide down on disappointing MI300 sales for 2025 is already expected." Instead, Reitzes asserts that Melius is now "more cautious on x86 server and PC over the long term for AMD," based on the conviction that "NVIDIA is going to increasingly 'come for them' in both markets [CPU and GPU] with their Arm-based CPUs that are optimized for accelerated PCs." The analyst goes on to note: "We are increasingly concerned that custom CPUs and Nvidia CPUs will cannibalize even more of the x86 server market long-term, even though AMD's current chip, Turin, is doing well." Accordingly, Melius Research has reduced its target for AMD shares from $160 to $129, implying an upside potential of ~12 percent relative to the stock's current pre-market price of $115.25. Bear in mind that HSBC recently noted that "AMD's AI GPU roadmap is less competitive than previously anticipated, limiting its penetration into the AI GPU market." Also, Wolfe Research noted in December 2024 that "AMD won’t be in a position to guide AI for CY25 – which will in itself drive concerns."

The move is intended to push TSMC towards localizing more of its production within the US. Impact of $TSM tariffs to largest customers$AAPL $NVDA $QCOM are almost fully dependant & would see costs ⬆️ & margins/vol ⬇️ $AMD has the most to lose as a relatively small % of $INTC biz is at $TSM. $AMD would lose share on large parts of X86 client & enterprise server biz — Mojo (@Mojo_flyin) January 28, 2025 Interestingly, should President Trump follow through on this threat, it would hurt AMD the most by reducing its market share in x86 client and enterprise server spheres. Intel would likely emerge as the sole winner from this upheaval. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Jim Cramer’s Broadcom (AVGO) Prediction Was Spot On

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC discussed the reasons behind the recent market declines after the ISM Services Index data. Cramer said many are still expecting more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve soon but they are wrong. “This survey showed surprising strength, so much strength that it makes you think that the FED might not give us more rate cuts anytime soon. Right now, a ton of investors believe that the FED needs to push through a bunch of rate cuts in order to revive the economy. Lots of those bulls are counting on those cuts. That seems wrong today. They were rocked to the core because not only have they been wrong, but they’re starting to question the FED’s credibility. They know nothing,” Cramer said. Cramer said he was “mystified” by the Fed’s rate cuts amid strong economic data. “These traders are wondering why the heck the FED cut short rates by 50 basis points September then give another 25 in November another 25 in December what the heck did they see that made them so aggressive judging by the data. Nothing. The credibility issue, if you claim you’re data dependent, and the data is strong then why the heck are you cutting so aggressively.” Cramer at the time said the latest nonfarm payrolls report would be one of the most important indicators of the economy and it would set the “dialog” in the coming days. Sure it will. The latest jobs data showed unemployment fell and job additions crushed Wall Street expectations. Many now believe the Fed is set to put brakes on rate cuts. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 stocks Cramer recently talked about. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 128 In early November, answering a question about a company, Jim Cramer said: “The semiconductor stocks are so hated that I have to urge you to buy a regular semiconductor right now because they are being put for sale like you wouldn’t believe. But go buy Broadcom, go buy Broadcom, AVGO, and you will like it more than Ultra. I’ll tell you, really.” Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling. However, the stock could face the impact of what Nvidia is facing today: too high expectations. In the latest quarterly results, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) revenue was largely in line with estimates. The company has narrowly exceeded revenue expectations by less than 5% in most cases. Some analysts suggest Broadcom’s growth rates will moderate to below 20% CAGR starting the first quarter of 2025. In fiscal Q4, it was +50% topline growth. The market won’t be kind to the stock when the revenue growth rate slows. Broadcom has about $58 billion in net debt, which is relatively high. Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Similar to the earnings results for Nvidia, shares of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) initially sold off after the company reported solid earnings that fell light of elevated market expectations, but the stock did recover from its drawdown in the matter of a few weeks. With an enticing combination of custom chip offerings as well as networking assets, Broadcom remains one of the best positioned companies as part of the AI revolution. Broadcom outlined a path to derive a majority of its revenue from the AI end market within a couple of years, and the non-AI part of the business has stabilized after a deep correction. The company’s dominant market position in its end markets, along with durable growth, strong margins and best-in-class capital allocation, presents an opportunity to compound capital over time.” Overall, AVGO ranks 1st on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Adobe Inc. (ADBE) the Most Promising Growth Stock According to Wall Street Analysts?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts. The new regulatory environment has the technology sector eyeing prominent growth opportunities in 2025 and beyond. Big Tech is set to release earnings next week and investors are excited to see how the group performed in the last quarter. On January 24, Dan Ives, managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, appeared in an interview on Morning Brief at Yahoo Finance to share his 2025 outlook for the tech sector. Ives suggested that the Street is underestimating the potential of Big Tech and advises investors to “grab popcorn” for the earnings week ahead. He also shared his optimism towards the billion-dollar investments made by the group before 2025 and claimed that the “fourth industrial revolution” has just begun. He also suggested that AI spending by companies heavily depends on the use cases for the company, and emphasized the unique selling point for each of the names in mega-cap tech names. Ives stated that the ability to monetize stall bases has been the crucial factor driving the growth among tech names, which happens to mimic what the hyperscalers have done. Ives emphasized that investments in artificial intelligence are now going to play out on the consumer side and remained confident that Big Tech is a step ahead in terms of the AI journey to monetization. He believes that seeing the return on investment play out, the Street is underestimating the growth in the tech sector, not just for the earnings next week but for 2025 as a whole. He also suggested that the regulatory environment is drastically changing especially in favor of the autonomous vehicles market and expects a massive year ahead for the segment and stocks associated with self-driving technologies and autonomous vehicle driving. The year ahead looks super solid for companies in the growth sector, namely artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, biotechnology, fintech, and software. While most of it is because of the efforts made by these names over the past year, the promising regulatory environment is going to boost the position of these stocks significantly. We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 23, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of engineers and scientists collaborating at a workstation surrounded by their applications and solutions. Analyst Upside as of January 23, 2025: 43% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 123 Some of Adobe Inc.’s (NASDAQ:ADBE) major products include Adobe Firefly, Adobe Express, Acrobat AI Assistant, and Adobe GenStudio. In October 2024, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) launched the Firefly Video Model in beta, expanding its family of creative generative AI models, safe for commercial use. Similarly, in December 2024, the company announced a partnership with Box, Inc. to shape the way digital media is created and used. Similarly, in an exciting update, on January 22, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) announced innovations to its AI tools and a $5 million investment in its Adobe Film and TV Fund to support underprivileged creators and filmmakers. Speaking of its innovations, ADBE unveiled new features in Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Frame.io to improve post-production and reduce the time spent on videos. Overall, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, the company’s digital media segment grew its revenue by 12%. The company holds precedence in the creative industry because of its exemplary tools and features. In addition to that, investors are particularly interested to see how its investments in AI play out in 2025 and beyond. Polen Capital’s Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We added to several existing positions in the quarter including Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Workday, Shopify, MSCI, and Paycom Software. We feel Adobe is poised for re-accelerating revenue and earnings growth partially due to the monetization of its Firefly GenAI product embedded in its creative software.” Overall, ADBE ranks 7th on our list of most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of ADBE to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ADBE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Institutional investors in KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) see US$7.3b decrease in market cap last week, although long-term gains have benefitted them.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, KLA's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions A total of 20 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business To get a sense of who is truly in control of KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 88% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$7.3b last week. However, the 18% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of KLA. See our latest analysis for KLA Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. KLA already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of KLA, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in KLA. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.7% and 4.5% of the stock. Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of KLA Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$115m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. With a 11% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over KLA. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for KLA that you should be aware of. Ultimately the future is most important. You can access this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.

Title: Tom Lee Calls Monday's Market Plunge a Great Buying Opportunity After AI, Crypto-Led Rout

Tom Lee, head of Fundstrat Research, discussed Monday's market sell-off as an "overreaction". On CNBC, Lee said that the double-digit drawdown in NVIDIA (NVDA) is the biggest opportunity since the covid outbreak and will prove to be a great buying moment. "Markets don't like uncertainty, to me, it's an overreaction, and this overreaction will be a great opportunity for investors," Lee said. Lee's call seems good so far. After Nasdaq sold off 3% and NVIDIA dropped 17%, ,Nasdaq futures are up 1% while NVDA is 5% higher in pre-market trading. Monday's sell-off in NVDA was the biggest single-day market cap loss in history, with NVIDIA losing $465 billion in market cap, according to Bloomberg Data. Bitcoin (BTC) fell as far as $97,500 on Monday and is already back above $103,000; but was as high as $105,000 before the news came out on the AI China's DeepSeek; this will be a level bulls will look to reclaim in the short-term. AI bitcoin miners also saw massive drawdowns, as much as 30%, including Core Scientific (CORZ), which is now slightly higher in pre-market. Lee also alludes to a healthy market structure in U.S. equities and notes that bitcoin has outperformed small caps and financials year to date. Wednesday turns to a Federal Reserve policy meeting which is largely expected for the federal funds rate to be paused at the 4:25-4:50 rate. Lee says there is some uncertainty going into the meeting as markets are currently too hawkish and believe the market is putting too much emphasis on a potential rate hike in 2025.

Title: DeepSeek Dip a "Buying Opportunity" for Nvidia and U.S. Tech Stocks, Says Wedbush

The market reacted negatively to DeepSeek's open-source AI release through shares of Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) and U.S. tech stocks, but Wedbush analysts urge investors to see the dip as a chance to buy. DeepSeek, based in Hangzhou, announced its R1 AI model development took two months to complete while spending less than $6 million. The model achieved explosive popularity and ascended to become Apple's App Store's number one position. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. DeepSeek's R1 model threatens American giants OpenAI and Meta (META, Financial), yet Wedbush analyst Dan Ives dismisses its impact on Nvidia and competitor performance. DeepSeek's remarkable achievements face multiple hurdles because of strict U.S. chip export regulations, according to Ives' assessment. DeepSeek's ability to contend against established U.S. tech infrastructure is in serious doubt, according to his analysis. Ives interprets the current decline in United States tech shares because he notices frequent market patterns that make these price levels attractive to investors. The extensive corporate investment by U.S. firms in AI across numerous applications, including robotics and autonomous mobility, makes it difficult for DeepSeek to create meaningful competition. The analyst confirmed Nvidia continues to reign as the dominant AI hardware market leader. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Short-Term BTC Holders Quit, CME Open Interest Slid by Record During Monday's Price Drop

Short-term bitcoin (BTC) holders exited the market at a loss Monday as tumbling prices also saw derivative traders throw in the towel, leading to a significant decline in open futures bets on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Short-term holders, defined by Glassnode as addresses with a history of holding coins for less than 155 days, sent over 21,000 BTC ($2.2 billion) to exchanges at a loss as the largest cryptocurrency fell as much as 4.7%, the most in two weeks, according to CoinDesk Indexes pricing. The transfer to exchanges, often a precursor to sales, was the second-biggest this month and may reflect that purchasers who'd bought when the price was near record highs around $108,000 toward the start of the year were spooked by the sudden slide back into the five digits. These addresses, owned by active traders, new entrants and weak hands, tend to be sensitive to price gyrations and often succumb when prices slide. BTC fell to under $98,000 as the weekend release of the Chinese startup DeepSeek challenged U.S. leadership in AI and technology. Other corners of the market also hinted at capitulation, often observed at local price bottoms. For instance, the perpetual funding rates for BTC flipped negative, a sign of stronger demand for bearish bets. That’s usually when bitcoin reaches a low such as on Jan. 13, when bitcoin dipped below $90,000 and Aug. 5, during the yen carry trade unwind. The de-risking also happened on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a proxy for institutional activity, which saw the biggest notional drop in open interest (OI) alongside a double-digit slide in chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). Notional bitcoin OI fell a record $2.4 billion (17,000 in BTC terms), driving the basis lower, according to Glassnode data. U.S. listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a massive outflow of $457.6 million. A similar outflow occurred Jan. 13, according to Farside data.

Title: Big Retail is bringing out Big AI. Consumers might not even notice
URL: https://qz.com/nrf-2025-retail-big-show-ai-nvidia-amazon-google-1851740452
Time Published: 2025-01-28T10:00:00Z

AI is no longer just a buzzword in retail. It’s a tool retailers are increasingly deploying to transform their business operations. Major retailers are partnering with tech giants such as Google, Amazon (AMZN), and Nvidia as they explore AI’s potential. At least at the moment, the technology’s biggest impact is being felt on the supply side, not the point-of-sale. Carrie Tharp, Google Cloud’s vice president of global solutions and industries, said this month that AI’s evolution, particularly its shift from text-based applications to multi-modal tools that process images and videos, can increasingly boost retailers’ bottom lines. “What this looks like for businesses is brand new experiences,” she said at the National Retail Federation (NRF) Retail’s Big Show in New York. AI-driven marketing will gather deeper insights into consumer behavior to enhance personalization, Tharp said. But the real value, she said, is in improving internal processes. Take Home Depot (HD). The home improvement giant has tested pilot projects to create hyper-personalized experiences for customers. While there are customer-facing benefits, the focus remains largely operational. AI is streamlining operations and optimizing Home Depot’s supply chain — which ultimately leads to better experiences for customers, whether or not they see it. Tharp emphasized the importance of equipping store associates and corporate teams with AI tools to drive efficiency. AI is enhancing speed and reducing human error by automating routine tasks, allowing workers to focus on more critical decisions. AI’s growing value to retailers was evident during discussions at this month’s NRF Big Show. Companies are eager to optimize their core operations — meaning that’s where they’re most willing to spend money on AI. Tharp highlighted how Google’s (GOOGL) AI products are being integrated into the retail journey behind-the-scenes. Google’s advancements in search and consumer metrics allow retailers to track up to 10 touch points, or the interactions a customer makes with an item or product before they make a purchase decision. With AI-powered systems, retailers can predict what products will be in demand before they go out of stock “This has important implications for supply chain optimization and demand forecasting, two areas where AI capabilities can be especially useful,” Tharp said. Quantum AI is expected to take retail to even greater heights — although Tharp stressed the importance of mastering basic AI use cases first. “The priority is not only to enhance customer experiences,” she said, “but also make back-end operations more nimble and responsive to changing market conditions.” Fast food chains and discount retailers are also catching on. Greg Fiddes, Google’s director of Chrome enterprise software partnerships, shared at NRF’s Big Show how Chrome OS, a cloud-based operating system, is being used to streamline in-store operations at pizza giant Domino’s — a chain that touted using AI to make pizzas “before people ordered them” last year. Chrome OS now essentially runs interactive kiosks and digital signage across Domino’s more than 6,700 U.S. locations. Fiddes also noted the security AI provides. The software has never experienced a ransomware attack such as the one seen by CrowdStrike last year. This is crucial during peak times such as Super Bowl Sunday , when Domino’s delivers up to two million pizzas. “If you don’t make, take or bake the pizzas, you support those who do,” Michael Crumley, Domino’s manager of store technology, said of TK. “The ability to remotely manage and support devices is a major benefit, especially for a large retail chain with multiple locations.” Other big food chains such as Chick-fil-A, McDonald’s, and Wendy’s are using some form of AI, all with the goal of feeding customers faster. Retail giant Costco also relies on Chrome OS to manage operations. Dollar Tree (DLTR) is using AI and low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite technology to streamline operations. This is especially helpful in rural areas where connectivity can be challenging. The move could help Dollar Tree better handle operations as it considers a sale of its Family Dollar brand. Retailers are already using AI autopilot systems — in which AI handles routine tasks and humans intervene only in critical situations — said Andrew Sun, who heads Nvidia’s (NVDA) AI for retail division. “No one ever feels like you have enough time to do the very manual work, moving a box off a truck, making sure it’s unpacked, getting it onto the shelf at the right price, and serving the customer,” Sun said, noting that the shift could simplify a hard job in a high turnover industry. The AI chip maker is moving beyond gaming and entertainment to look at how AI can make more efficient use of labor and reduce human error – two key factors that can make or break a supply chain. The real win for the retail industry might not be in delivering more sophisticated customer experiences, but in building a stronger, more resilient infrastructure. For now, AI’s on the supply side, but as the tech matures, it will seep more substantially into every customer interaction and companies lagging behind in AI adoption may be in for a rude awakening. “While companies are making strides, the majority are still medium to slow followers in AI adoption,” said Jerry Sheldon, vice president at global research firm IHL Services. “This gap could lead to significant competitive advantages for early adopters and heavy investors.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Where to invest $10,000 right now, according to 6 experts
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/where-to-invest-10000-right-now-market-experts-stocks-bonds-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-28T09:00:02Z
Full Content:
Do you have $10,000 burning a hole in your pocket? If you're looking to invest it, you've come to the right place. Investing can be tricky. How much should you allocate to stocks and bonds? What if you need the money in five years? When should you come into the market if stocks are in the middle of a volatile period, like they seem to have entered on Monday? Ultimately, everyone has different goals and needs with their money, and deciding where to put it calls for individualized plans that account for timelines and how much potential losses one can stomach. If you're looking for ideas, we've got you covered. In recent weeks, we asked six experts where investors sitting on a chunk of money should consider putting their cash for the months and years ahead. Answers, which came before Monday's stock market sell-off, varied across asset classes and timelines and are listed below. Stock market valuations are high, leading some of Wall Street's biggest names to worry that the S&P 500 is a bubble ready to pop. While Ragan recognizes valuations are elevated, he still sees opportunities for investors to put cash to work. "We're still pretty comfortable adding funds to the market," Ragan told BI. "We still like the S&P 500 and large-cap US equities." Among large-cap companies, technology stocks have pushed the market higher, which is why Ragan believes it's important to maintain a dedicated allocation to tech. "On one hand, we're saying don't get too overweight there, but I think you still want to have exposure in that sector," Ragan said of tech. However, it's important to have diversified sector exposure, and Ragan sees opportunities in communication services, healthcare, and financials. Companies in these sectors tend to have low price-to-earnings-growth ratios, meaning they're undervalued relative to their earnings growth rate. These sectors will also benefit from increased deregulation under President Donald Trump, Ragan said. Dividend stocks are also trading at attractive valuations, he added. These stocks can benefit a portfolio by providing a steady income stream. With rising yields, Ragan also sees opportunities in fixed income, particularly in short-term bonds. Don't just stick with Treasurys, though. Ragan recommends adding corporate and municipal bonds to the mix. Examples of funds that offer exposure to these areas of the market include the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (SPYD) and the Invesco KBW Bank ETF (KBWY). On the heels of two stellar years for the stock market, Dobler said he's inclined to be a bit more defensive and cautious in the year ahead — especially if an investor is looking at a short-term time horizon. Price-multiple expansion won't come as easy, and investors are going to be looking for real earnings results, he said. Broadly speaking, that boils down to taking a three-part approach: allocating to fixed-income amid robust yields, so-called real assets as inflation stays elevated, and defensive parts of the stock market amid stretched valuations. Within the fixed-income category, Dobler likes investment-grade credit, Treasury inflation-protected securities, and municipal bonds. US money-market funds and high-yield savings accounts are also attractive options, he said. As for real assets, he said real estate, commodities, and infrastructure plays would get a boost as inflation remains sticky. And for defensive stocks, he said quality companies — those with stable and consistent earnings track records — would benefit if growth stocks start to hit trouble like they did in 2022. "The economy is slowing, financial conditions are tightening, and so it'll reward more of a defensive- and quality-focused strategy," Dobler said. Some examples of exchange-traded funds offering exposure to Dobler's ideas include the GMO US Quality ETF (QLTY), the VanEck Real Assets ETF (RAAX), and the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD). Quinzel believes that US exceptionalism will drive the stock market in 2025. Stocks have posted strong earnings, the US GDP is slated to grow at 2% to 3% this year, and secular tailwinds such as AI will provide a significant boost to the economy, he said. If you're looking to grow $10,000, "you certainly want to have diversified equities, and you certainly want to be focused on the US," Quinzel told BI. In this environment, investors shouldn't feel constrained by the 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio, especially if you have a long time horizon, Quinzel said. It's perfectly OK to take advantage of the robust economy and allocate 80%, or even all, of your portfolio to equities, he said. For those who want to add more stability to their portfolios through fixed income, Quinzel recommends steering clear of high-yield bonds and going for Treasurys, corporate credit, and asset-backed securities. Quinzel also echoed Ragan's suggestion that investors branch out from the Magnificent Seven. He sees plenty of opportunities to play the Trump trade, such as financials and industrials. Both of these sectors will benefit from deregulation, M&A activity, onshoring, and defense spending, which Quinzel anticipates will increase under the new administration. Quinzel is also a fan of momentum and quality investing. "One great way to start investing is by simply utilizing funds that have those traits of momentum and quality because both of those can do really well in this kind of late cycle mode that we're in," he said. Funds that provide exposure to these market areas include the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) and the Invesco S&P 500 Quality ETF (SPHQ). For those up for a more hands-on project, buying a multifamily property could be a good option, said Brian Rudderow, a real-estate investor and the CEO of HBR Colorado. While that may sound like it's outside the realm of possibility with just $10,000, Rudderow pointed to a Fannie Mae program launched in late 2023 that allows mom-and-pop investors to buy multifamily properties with just a 5% down payment. That's $10,000 for a $200,000 property. That's still relatively cheap for a multifamily property, let alone for a single-family home, in many areas around the US. But they do exist. "If you can find a lower-income city or a cheaper side of town, then you can do it with $10,000," Rudderow said. The monthly mortgage payment on a property at this price point would be around $2,500, Rudderow said. So, if you charged around $1,500 per unit, you could generate a positive cash flow of $500 a month. The stock market performed strongly in 2024, and Milan believes investors should be optimistic about its continued growth. There are plenty of opportunities for investors to put their cash to work. Industrials, financials, and energy are popular sectors for investors looking to take advantage of the Trump trade, Milan said. He also sees individual opportunities within those broad sectors. Investors should keep an eye on energy in particular. "For the first time in a number of years, there's a significant amount of value and strength in the energy sector," Milan said. If Trump's first term is any indicator of what's to come, Milan is bullish that the president's policies will be extremely beneficial for energy companies. Milan is less focused on big oil companies and more interested in natural gas. "Natural gas pipelines are showing extraordinary strength from a momentum standpoint right now," he said. His top picks include Enterprise Product Partners (EPD) and Energy Transfer (ET). Within financials, Milan is bullish on large private equity firms such as Blackstone (BX), Apollo Global Management (APO), and KKR & Co (KKR). "I think we're at the beginning stages of the next evolution within those types of firms, especially with regards to private credit," Milan said. These firms have poured a significant amount of resources into the private credit business, and Milan believes the asset class will take off in the coming years. Looking into the next 12 months, Roberts said he's increasingly leaning into the AI trade with the $2 billion portfolio he manages as infrastructure investment continues to grow. "It's coming, and it's coming fast," Roberts said. Part of that trade means investing in software and chips companies, like Twilio (TWLO), Palantir (PLTR), Nvidia (NVDA), and AMD (AMD), he said. Another piece of that play is in the energy companies that will provide the power to run data centers, he said. Some of his holdings include American Electric Power (AEP), Duke Energy (DUK), Kinder Morgan (KMI), and GE Vernova (GEV). But Roberts isn't blanketly bullish on AI-related stocks. Investors will start to put more of an emphasis on fundamentals, he said, and parts of the growth factor may start to get washed out in the year ahead. This may come amid a move into safer, dividend-providing stocks like Procter & Gamble (PG), he said. "I think the unobvious trade is a rotation potentially from high-beta growth," Roberts said. "Dividend value has been really ignored over the last couple of years, and it's very out of favor." Jump to

Title: “MBA fees ₹25,00,000, ROI uncertain”: CA warns as elite MBAs no longer guarantee jobs, but increases loan pressures

Feedback The job market for MBA graduates has reached a critical juncture, sparking conversations across social media and beyond. A post by CA Nitin Kaushik on X, using the handle @Finance_Bareek, captured the sentiment perfectly: “𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚: MBA fees ₹25,00,000, ROI: Uncertain. Research before enrolling.” Kaushik’s post resonates with a growing number of MBA aspirants and professionals grappling with the changing realities of the job market. The issue isn’t confined to India; even graduates from elite institutions like Harvard, Stanford, and Wharton are feeling the squeeze. 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚: MBA fees: ₹25,00,000 ROI: Uncertain Research before enrolling. 🎓💡#stockmarketcrash #niftycrash #financetips #investingbehaviour The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) recently reported that 23% of Harvard Business School’s 2024 MBA graduates were jobless three months after graduation. This number has more than doubled since 2022 when it stood at 10%. Other top-tier schools like Stanford and Wharton have seen similar dips, with unemployment rates hovering around 20%. The issue isn’t just limited to the US. According to the International Labor Organisation’s Global Employment Trends for Youth 2024, 13% of the global youth labour force was unemployed in 2023—a figure representing nearly 65 million people. Why are MBAs struggling? Despite boasting median starting salaries exceeding $175,000, MBA graduates are finding it harder to land jobs due to shifting hiring practices. Consulting firms like McKinsey and BCG, alongside tech giants such as Google and Amazon, have drastically reduced MBA hires amid widespread layoffs and economic slowdowns. Post-pandemic structural changes have also left companies preferring smaller, highly skilled teams. The rise of AI and automation further compounds the issue, making generalist MBA degrees less appealing compared to targeted certifications and boot camps. Kristen Fitzpatrick, who oversees career development at Harvard Business School, put it bluntly: “Going to Harvard is not going to be a differentiator.” Instead, companies are now focusing on technical and specialized skills. How MBA Education Needs to Evolve To address these challenges, institutions are pivoting toward innovative solutions. Harvard is testing an AI tool to match graduates with jobs and suggest courses to bridge skill gaps. Some graduates have found success by lowering their expectations and opting for less conventional roles, according to Forbes. One thing is clear—degrees alone won’t cut it anymore. The future belongs to professionals who continuously upskill to meet the ever-changing demands of the workforce. Copyright©2025 Living Media India Limited.

The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana - PMAY (Urban) - has made steady progress since it was announced in mid-2015. Data by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs indicates 118.64 lakh homes have been sanctioned as of 20th January 2025. Nearly 90.22 lakh units have been completed, and nearly 112.50 lakh have been ‘grounded’. In terms of the financials, nearly INR 200,000 Cr of central assistance has already been committed. Despite fairly good progress, PMAY must be made accessible to more people, and awareness about it also needs a big shot in the arm. New adaptable, sustainable and low-cost construction technologies can be used to rapidly develop large mass housing projects. The government should also try to eliminate bottlenecks in property records. An important aspect of PMAY is interest subsidy on home loans, and direct subsidy for individual house construction or enhancement. However, to qualify for these subsidies, properties need title documents - a big hurdle, since India’s land records system is far from sophisticated enough right now to address the task holistically and at scale. Any announcements that Union Budget 2025-26 will make in context with affordable housing will doubtlessly involve PMAY. Creative solutions and strong political will can bring this vitally important programme back to centre stage, which is where it belongs. Nationally, rising prices have led to a gradual tapering down of luxury housing, and this may trigger an inflection point where the cycle can once again turn positive for the affordable segment. Any substantial announcement for the affordable housing segment in the upcoming Union Budget can strengthen the trend and give affordable housing a seriously needed leg-up. The Government is expected to walk a thin line on maintaining the fiscal deficit targets and stimulating the slowing economy with increased infrastructure investments, incentives for job creation and increasing disposable income with the middle class segment. Veloce Fintech, a part of the Lemon Group, had launched its SEBI-registered Category-II Alternative Investment Fund (AIF), the Veloce Opportunities Fund.

Read more We have been maintaining our bearish stance since the last 2 - 3 months and have been repeatedly advocating against catching the falling knife. Now, since we are about to enter a crucial and major support zone of 22800 - 22400, we would change our stance from bearish to cautious now. From hereon, it would be very difficult to anticipate what the Union Budget has to offer and other global developments, but unless there is any major disappointment from the budget or any other global aberration, markets are likely to see some respite in the mentioned support zone any time soon. This certainly does not mean one should start buying throttle; but yes, accumulation in a staggered manner in the coming days is advisable with no leveraged positions. On the upside, the bearish gap of 23000-23050 is likely to resist any pullbacks ahead of the event, while the formidable obstacle is present around 23350, coinciding with the 20 DEMA. As we look ahead to the week, a plethora of events is set to unfold, each holding the potential to shift market dynamics significantly. Given this landscape of potential developments, it’s essential to remain agile and responsive. The anticipated increase in volatility presents opportunities to capitalize on market movements, whether they trend upward or downward. Staying alert and adaptable will be crucial for navigating the twists and turns that lie ahead. It could possibly be hasty to build in rate cut expectations in the February review as the broader growth inflation mix does not unambiguously call for the same. Having said that, this remains a close call and would clearly involve a subjective call with respect to the timing. Given that liquidity actions have a far direct and sustained impact, which has clearly been done, there is clearly merit in pushing back rate cuts possibly until there is more clarity on the external front as well as evolution of domestic growth inflation mix as well as liquidity conditions over the coming quarters. The April review possibly remains a better bet for the same. In the near term, the union budget should set the tone both for any potential fiscal actions to address consumption demand in the economy and to revive private sector investments.

ENERGY International crude oil prices tumbled on Monday amid concern that weakness in China’s economy will keep its energy demand depressed. Also, Monday’s stock rout sparked a risk-off sentiment in asset markets. Losses in crude were contained as the dollar index fell to a 5-week low. International crude prices have started marginally higher this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading ahead of the outcome of the Fed meeting. NYMEX WTI March range for the day is between $70.65 to $76.20, while the MCX February crude futures could trade within the range of 6,110 to 6,560.

The Commodity Weather Group said that forecasts moved warmer for the central part of the US for February 1 to 5 and could reduce demand for gas. NYMEX Gas prices have started flat this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading. NYMEX Gas March range for the day is between $3.080 to $3.420, while the MCX February NG futures could trade within the range of 268 to 294. On the options side, highest Call OI is at 320 strike, while the highest Put OI is at 260 strike for 21 February 2025 expiry. BASE METALS LME and domestic MCX copper tumbled on Monday as market sentiment was dampened by US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs and sanctions on Colombia. The Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields extended losses and capped downside on Monday’s session. On the data front, it was overall positive for the Dollar and weighed on gold and silver. Other metals ended weaker on LME and MCX on Monday’s trade. From an intraday perspective, international copper has started mixed this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading as there is broader risk-off sentiment across base metals. The Dollar Index and bond yields gained this Tuesday morning ahead of Fed. Although, the beginning of the Chinese New Year holiday today will keep volumes low. Intraday, the range for LME copper is between $8,940 to $9,320, while that for MCX February copper is between 814 to 846. On the MCX Copper options side, highest Call OI is at 840 strike, while the highest Put OI is at 840 strike for 21 February 2025 expiry.

Domestically, the range for MCX aluminium February is 245 to 253, while that for MCX zinc February is 266 to 273 and that for MCX lead February is 178 to 181 Currency The Indian Rupee opened weaker against the Dollar on Tuesday tracking a decline in most of its regional peers amid dampened risk appetite. A recovery in the Dollar Index and Treasury Yields this Tuesday morning could also weigh on the Rupee. Although, a drop in the crude oil prices and possibly a small recovery on the domestic equity markets could cap losses for the Rupee. In the overseas markets, the U.S. Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields eased on Monday. The Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields has started with gains this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading ahead of the Fed meeting outcome this week. Key triggers today will be Durable goods orders. The Euro ended marginally higher on Monday but started weaker against the Dollar this Tuesday morning trade in Asia amid forecasts of a rate cut from the ECB this week. The Pound/Sterling gained against the Dollar this Monday but started weaker against the Dollar this Tuesday morning trade in Asia, tracking a recovery of the greenback. The Japanese Yen appreciated against the Dollar on Monday on BoJ rate hike revisions, although the Yen started weaker further this Tuesday morning as the dollar rebounded following fresh tariff threats from US President Donald Trump. US benchmarks showed a mix of performances, with both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 registering losses, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) remained positive. The decline in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 was mainly due to the significant drop in tech stocks, particularly Nvidia, after the introduction of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI assistant that’s much cheaper than its US counterparts, affecting the AI landscape dynamics. Over in Asia, the Nikkei fell as the US tech stock turmoil spread to Japan, and the strengthening yen further dampened market sentiment. Meanwhile, the Hang Seng index stayed nearly flat after starting the day strong. Domestically, markets are expected to open on a positive note, but global sentiments might influence the benchmarks as the day goes on. The IT sector is predicted to remain under pressure due to the developments around DeepSeek and the general weakness in global tech sentiment. The benchmark index started the trading week with continued selling pressure from the prior session, opening 152 points lower and breaching the critical support level around 22976. This set a bearish tone for the day, culminating in a close within the lower quartile of the trading range—marking a panic day as it finished 263 points down from the previous close. This situation has resulted in significantly oversold market conditions, suggesting that the near-term incentive for additional short positions is relatively low, which is a positive development. The area around 22800 now serves as a vital support level, and maintaining a position above it will be essential to garner bullish strength. Yesterday’s trading session saw bearish sentiment dominate Dalal Street, with Nifty closing well below the 23,000 mark. Pessimism persists due to global headwinds, including uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariff plans and significant outflows from Foreign Institutional Investors, amounting to Rs. 74,096 crore in January. Wall Street also reacted negatively to reports of Chinese startup DeepSeek’s cost-efficient AI model, posing a challenge to major U.S. tech giants. Key upcoming catalysts include the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on January 28-29 and the Union Budget 2025 on February 1st. Stocks in focus include Bajaj Auto, Hindustan Zinc, Hyundai Motors, Cipla, TVS Motors, and Coal India, which reported a 17% decline in Q3 net profit to Rs. 8,505.57 crore. Sell Balkrishna Industries (CMP 2565) in the 2590-2610 zone with a stop at 2727 for targets of 2489/2419. Also, bearish positions are recommended for Jindal Steel & Power, Divis Lab, and Balkrishna Industries on any early intraday strength. From a technical perspective, the market is consistently facing selling pressure at higher levels and is forming lower tops on daily charts, which is negative. Technically, the levels of 23,000 and 23,050 would serve as key resistance areas, while 22800 and 22,750 could act as important support zones. If it falls below 22,750, selling pressure may intensify that could send market to 22600 levels. The strategy should be to reduce weak long positions around 23000-23050 levels, however, during the week if it falls to 22600 then we should look for buying select stocks with a medium to long-term view. Regarding Bank Nifty, as long as it remains below 49000, weak sentiment will likely persist. On the downside, it could decline to the 47,500-47,200 range. However, if it rises above 49,000, there could be a rebound to the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) or up to 49,500. “The DeepSeek impact on the US stock market in general, and the tech stocks in particular, has turned out to be a reality check for the overvalued stock market. In the medium-term this is likely to have a sobering effect on markets, globally. The Indian market appears to be oversold and is set for a rebound. The RBI’s announcement of measures to boost the liquidity in the banking system by around Rs 1.5 trillion is positive for the market. This raises the prospects of a rate cut by the MPC in the February policy meeting. Banks are likely to benefit. After the correction the market is now trading at fair valuations which are in line with long-term (10-year) averages. Investors can utilise the opportunity to buy fundamentally strong high quality stocks. The outperformance of largecaps over mid-and smallcaps is a healthy trend.” 360 ONE’s operating revenue grew 38% YoY and was 7% higher than our estimates, driven by 14% beat in transactional income. Additionally, strong beat in other income resulted in 17% beat in PAT at Rs 270 crore (+42% YoY). 360 ONE’s Board has proposed the acquisition of one of India’s leading brokerage and corporate advisory houses – B&K Securities. The proposed acquisition of B&K will add a new research capability across all platforms of 360 ONE and also provide entry into the IB segment. Since the cost structure of B&K is aligned with 360 ONE, the acquisition will be EPS accretive. We reiterate our BUY rating with a one-year target price of Rs 1,350 Investing in AI may be nothing like as expensive as previously thought. This should accelerate the advancement of the technology. But at the same time it also means that chief financial officers will start to ask questions about the enormous amounts being spent on computing power in the AI arms race. GREED & fear has been concerned that the stock market would at some point this year question all this spending in the continuing absence of clear proof of monetisation. This was, first and foremost, a potential threat to the share prices of the hyperscalers who have been spending the money. But the DeepSeek news will now cause pressure on the AI hardware supply chain on concerns that the likes of Meta will do a U-turn and slash capex spending. The other issue raised by the DeepSeek news is that, while it is clearer than ever that the age of AI is coming, it is also increasingly equally clear that the long fashionable concepts of “moats”, as applied by fund managers to individual companies in the investment world, looks ever more precarious, if not redundant, in the AI world given the monumental scope for disruption. This is highly relevant given the massive market capitalisations represented by Big Tech at a time when these companies have in practice been converging on the same AI area to compete with each other. It seems unlikely in the extreme to GREED & fear that all the current dominant incumbents will prevail in the new world order which emerges. :Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty 50 are likely to open gap up as trend in GIFT Nifty suggest a positive start for the broader index. Asian markets were trading mixed. Nasdaq posted its biggest one-day percentage drop since December18 on Monday as a low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model prompted a steep selloff in U.S. chipmakers.

Spot gold is likely to slip towards $2720 level on strong dollar and rise in US treasury yields. Further, investors will remain cautious ahead of US Federal Reserve monetary policy where central bank is likely to keep its policy unchanged, while all eyes will be on comments to get clarity on future rate path. Additionally, market will try to decode how US President Donald Trump’s policies will impact Fed’s views on growth and inflation. Moreover, expectation of improved economic data from US will hurt prices HDFC Securities has a ‘reduce’ on Indian Oil Corporation with a target price of Rs 124, on margin pressure due to increasing petchem supplies/capacity, lower refining margins, and moderation in auto fuel marketing margins.

HDFC Sec said gross refining margin came in lower than estimates at $2.9/bbl, while gross debt rose 24% on year to Rs 1.3 lakh crore.

Lower e-auction price as well as minimal volume growth dented revenue, while EBITDA fell 13% YoY to Rs 10400 crore and EBITDA per ton fell to Rs 535 down by Rs 89/ton. Nuvama said it was trimming the coal miner’s FY25 and FY26 EBITDA by 3% and 5% respectively to factor i the lower volume. The stock was more of a dividend play, it said, adding, “We do not see much downside, but prefer to wait for volume growth to re-enter the stock.” Bank Nifty witnessed some outperformance led by index pivotal compared to the broader markets sell off across sectors and stocks to decline by 0.6% for the day. The 100-week average would be at 47,100 levels which is at support while on the higher side resistance would be at 49,200 levels. RSI is trending below the average line, and other key technical indicators are oversold form current levels so a minor pullback cannot be ruled out from current levels. Highest call OI has moved lower to 50,000 strikes while the downside the highest put OI has moved lower to 47,500 for the monthly expiry NIFTY-50 has closed at 7-month lows and now the support would move lower to the monthly pivot of 22,600 from current levels. We expect some sharp volatility in the second half on back of the monthly expiry in the Sensex and Bankex as well as roll over movement in individual sectors and stocks. RSI is oversold on hourly charts and expect some rebound from the lower range to test the average line from current levels. Highest call OI has moved lower to 23,200 strikes while the downside the highest put is at 22,500 for the monthly expiry. Coal India’s 3QFY25 witnessed a decent improvement following the drag seen in 2QFY25 (which was affected by extended monsoon). The e-auction volumes also remained elevated with some increase in e-auction premiums, which supported profitability. - For FY26/FY27, we maintain our estimates and expect volumes to improve, which would boost earnings performance. The e-auction premium is expected to remain stable ahead. - The company’s focus on increasing coal-washer capacity will improve its market share in domestic coking/non-coking coal. Further, management is focusing on coalmine expansions, which would be funded via internal accruals, or COAL might borrow to undertake certain strategic diversification projects, such as RE facilities and coal gasification, et al. - At CMP, the stock is trading at 3.3x FY27E EV/EBITDA. We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR480 (premised on 4.5x on FY27 EV/EBITDA). - COAL remains our top pick in the metals and mining sector Wall Street tumbled on Monday on threat to US tech companies from DeepSeek, an AI competitor in China. Big Tech stocks took the heaviest losses, with Nvidia down 17%, dragging the Nasdaq composite down 3% ACC’s third quarter was characterised by strong volume growth but weak unitary EBITDA, said Nomura, pointing out the duty refund masked a disappointing quarter. Adjusting for this, the EBITDA of Rs 144/ton was down 4 per cent sequentially, making ACC the only major cement producer to report a quarterly decline. Cement volumes grew 20% YoY to 10.7 million ton, above estimates. “We expect higher share of MSA (master supply agreement) volumes. This could also include some portion of Penna (unlisted) or Sanghi volumes,” said the brokerage firm. It said it maintained its ‘reduce’ recommendation and target price of Rs 1920 based on 10x one-year forward EV/EBITDA The short-term outlook is bullish for the Bank of India. The stock began the week on a positive note, surging 6 per cent on Monday. A complex inverted head and shoulder pattern is visible on the daily chart. The neckline support of this pattern is at ₹101. Below this, the broad ₹100-₹97 region is the next strong support.

January 27, 2025 14:49 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming February 18, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (“Kaspi” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: KSPI) securities between January 19, 2024 and September 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR KASPI INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On September 19, 2024, Culper Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Kaspi "systematically misled U.S. investors and regulators in its repeated claims – especially ahead of the Company’s January 2024 NASDAQ listing – that the Company has zero exposure to Russia." The Culper Research report alleges that, in fact "Russia has contributed materially to Kaspi's reported growth." On this news, Kaspi’s stock price fell $19.20, or 16.1%, to close at $99.81 per share on September 19, 2024, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Kaspi continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Kaspi securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than February 18, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Defense stocks were in focus after the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, and could present an intriguing opportunity for investors looking to extend Wall Street's tailwinds into February. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, Axon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE:NOC) are among the best names to own next month. AXON and NOC averaged impressive February gains of 8% and 4.1% over the past 10 years, respectively, both finishing higher nine times out of 10. From AXON's current perch, a move of similar magnitude would place it above $650 for the first time since December, while NOC could conquer $520 for the first time since November. AXON was last seen down 1.2% to trade at $603.16 at last check, but boasts a massive 139.5% year-over-year lead. The equity has been struggling with overhead pressure at its 40-day moving average since pulling back from its Dec. 6. record peak of $698.67. NOC sports a much more modest 13.9% lead for the last 12 months, but was last seen 0.7% higher to trade at $500.62. The shares are now looking to snap a three-day losing streak and are consolidating above their 60-day trendline. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: What Is DeepSeek? What to Know About the Chinese AI Startup That Spurred a Stock Selloff

Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and a slew of other stocks related to AI sold off Monday as an app from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek boomed in popularity. DeepSeek's AI assistant recently topped the list of free iPhone apps on Apple's (AAPL) app store. (It wasn't in the top 10 on Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Play store, though it is listed there.) In Apple's store, the app ranked higher than ChatGPT; not so on Google. Here’s what you need to know about DeepSeek—and why it’s having a big impact on markets. And if you're wondering if it wasn't that long ago that another Chinese app was topping the download charts, you're not wrong. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup founded by hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, was founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China, the tech hub home to Alibaba (BABA) and many of China’s other high-flying tech giants. The company says its latest R1 AI model released last week offers performance that is on par with that of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Its V3 base model launched in December was also reportedly developed in just two months for under $6 million, at a time when the U.S. is limiting China's access to its most sophisticated chips and American AI leaders like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta Platforms (META) are spending billions of dollars on development. The rapid ascension of DeepSeek has investors worried it could threaten assumptions about how much competitive AI models cost to develop, as well as the kind of infrastructure needed to support them, with wide-reaching implications for the AI marketplace and Big Tech shares. Nvidia in a statement called DeepSeek "an excellent AI advancement," calling it a "perfect example" of a concept known as test time scaling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 3% Monday as investors dragged a host of stocks with ties to AI, from chip to energy firms, downwards. Shares of American AI chipmakers including Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO) and AMD (AMD) sold off, along with those of international partners like TSMC (TSM). The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped more than 9%. Networking solutions and hardware partner stocks dropped along with them, including Dell (Dell), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Arista Networks (ANET). Some energy stocks were hit too. Shares of nuclear and other energy companies that saw their stocks boom in the last year in anticipation of an AI-driven boom in energy demand, such as Vistra (VST), Constellation Energy (CEG), Oklo (OKLO), and NuScale (SMR), also lost ground Monday. Meanwhile, some non-tech sectors like consumer staples rose Monday, marking a reconsideration of the market's momentum in recent months. Several analysts raised doubts about the longevity of the market’s reaction Monday, suggesting that the day's pullback could offer investors a chance to pick up AI names set for a rebound. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon called the reaction “overblown” and maintained an “outperform” rating for Nvidia’s stock price. Citi analysts, who said they expect AI companies to continue buying its advanced chips, maintained a "buy" rating on Nvidia. Wedbush analysts, who voiced skepticism that any major U.S. companies would use a Chinese startup like DeepSeek to build their AI infrastructure, said “launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing… launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.” Wedbush called Monday a “golden buying opportunity” to own shares in ChatGPT backer Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Palantir (PLTR), and other heavyweights of the American AI ecosystem that had come under pressure. UPDATE—Jan. 27, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to include additional information and reflect more recent share price values.

In Apple's store, the app ranked higher than ChatGPT; not so on Google. Here’s what you need to know about DeepSeek—and why it’s having a big impact on markets. And if you're wondering if it wasn't that long ago that another Chinese app was topping the download charts, you're not wrong. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup founded by hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, was founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China, the tech hub home to Alibaba (BABA) and many of China’s other high-flying tech giants. The company says its latest R1 AI model released last week offers performance that is on par with that of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Its V3 base model launched in December was also reportedly developed in just two months for under $6 million, at a time when the U.S. is limiting China's access to its most sophisticated chips and American AI leaders like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta Platforms (META) are spending billions of dollars on development. The rapid ascension of DeepSeek has investors worried it could threaten assumptions about how much competitive AI models cost to develop, as well as the kind of infrastructure needed to support them, with wide-reaching implications for the AI marketplace and Big Tech shares. Nvidia in a statement called DeepSeek "an excellent AI advancement," calling it a "perfect example" of a concept known as test time scaling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 3% Monday as investors dragged a host of stocks with ties to AI, from chip to energy firms, downwards. Shares of American AI chipmakers including Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO) and AMD (AMD) sold off, along with those of international partners like TSMC (TSM). The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped more than 9%. Networking solutions and hardware partner stocks dropped along with them, including Dell (Dell), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Arista Networks (ANET). Some energy stocks were hit too. Shares of nuclear and other energy companies that saw their stocks boom in the last year in anticipation of an AI-driven boom in energy demand, such as Vistra (VST), Constellation Energy (CEG), Oklo (OKLO), and NuScale (SMR), also lost ground Monday. Meanwhile, some non-tech sectors like consumer staples rose Monday, marking a reconsideration of the market's momentum in recent months. Several analysts raised doubts about the longevity of the market’s reaction Monday, suggesting that the day's pullback could offer investors a chance to pick up AI names set for a rebound. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon called the reaction “overblown” and maintained an “outperform” rating for Nvidia’s stock price. Citi analysts, who said they expect AI companies to continue buying its advanced chips, maintained a "buy" rating on Nvidia. Wedbush analysts, who voiced skepticism that any major U.S. companies would use a Chinese startup like DeepSeek to build their AI infrastructure, said “launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing… launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.” Wedbush called Monday a “golden buying opportunity” to own shares in ChatGPT backer Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Palantir (PLTR), and other heavyweights of the American AI ecosystem that had come under pressure.

Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek said it would temporarily limit signups after being the victim of “large-scale malicious attacks” on its servers. Existing users can log in without problems, the company said on its website. Earlier on Monday, the company said it would restrict signups for new users to people with a mainland China phone number. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open-source large language model, which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company launched a model that it said rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META+1.62%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.34%) App Store over the weekend. DeepSeek says it built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia (NVDA-1.25%), which could put pressure on the major semiconductor maker. The reported cyberattacks come as DeepSeek’s advanced technology sparked a widespread sell-off on Monday morning. Nvidia’s stock plunged more than 15%, wiping out $18 billion of founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML+3.69%), Broadcom (AVGO+4.34%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI+2.21%), Micron (MU+3.54%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+2.58%) The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell by more than 600 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia, took a hit earlier on Monday but has since bounced back to a net 48-point gain. The S&P 500 is down almost 2%, or 107 points. “[T]he Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution,” Wedbush Securities analysts led by Dan Ives said in a note. “While the model is impressive and it will have a ripple impact,” they added, U.S. tech companies are focused on achieving artificial general intelligence, with a focus on “the infrastructure and ecosystem that China and especially DeepSeek cannot come close to in our view.” —Rocio Fabbro and Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Sean Pyles: Insurance is designed to protect you from financial ruin when unlikely but potentially catastrophic events occur. Sara Rathner: But what happens when those potentially catastrophic events become more and more likely to happen? Sean Pyles: This episode, we’ll help you understand how to think about protecting your home and other assets with insurance as climate disasters increase in frequency. Welcome to NerdWallet's Smart Money podcast. I'm Sean Pyles. Sara Rathner: And I'm Sara Rathner. This episode we'll answer a listener's question about whether money market accounts are better than high-yield savings accounts and how to know which one to use to meet your savings goals. Sean Pyles: But first, we are going to talk about a significant nationwide issue coming up in the aftermath of the fires in and around Los Angeles. In fact, an issue that's been building with each weather-related catastrophe: it's the skyrocketing cost of home insurance. Sara Rathner: If you're a homeowner, you're probably already seeing this in your monthly bills, and if you're a renter, this affects you too because your landlord has to pay insurance for your building. Sean Pyles: We're joined now by Caitlin Constantine. She oversees home insurance coverage here at NerdWallet. Caitlin did a special series for us back in the spring of 2023 on the financial ramifications of climate change. We did an entire episode on what was happening with home insurance in the wake of floods, hurricanes, fires, tornadoes, and everything else Mother Nature throws at us. So we're getting the latest on this to help you cope with a future that is rapidly changing. Caitlin, welcome back. Caitlin Constantine: Thanks, Sean and Sara, I'm always happy to join you, but my gosh, the circumstances for this conversation could not be worse. Sara Rathner: Yeah. What's happened and is happening in and around Los Angeles is a disaster of staggering proportions. You have tens of thousands of folks who are displaced, many who no longer have a home, and it's not like there are homes to spare in that part of the country. So what these fire victims are facing is not only finding shelter, but figuring out where they're going to eventually live. And that's getting more and more complex because insurance companies are pulling out of a lot of these climate change crisis zones, right? Caitlin Constantine: Right. We've seen Florida, California, and Louisiana all have challenges with keeping insurers for a variety of reasons, but underpinning all of this is the fact that climate-related disasters are becoming more common, more extreme, and more costly. So let's take California. Over the past few years, California has actually seen several major insurers like Allstate, State Farm, and Farmers either stop writing new home insurance policies or decline to renew other policies. In fact, in July, State Farm dropped about 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades alone. Insurers say that the cost of paying for wildfire losses has been greater than what they were able to collect in premiums, so they chose to reduce how much they were covering in the state instead of continuing to take those losses. Sean Pyles: And just last month, California's insurance commissioner released new rules that were supposed to bolster the insurance market in the state. Where might that play out in this recovery effort? Caitlin Constantine: So these new regulations require insurers to write more home insurance policies in areas with high risk of wildfire. In exchange, those insurers can make changes in how they set their rates, and that's likely going to result in higher premiums. To put it simply, more California homeowners will likely have access to home insurance, but they're going to have to pay more for it. The regulations may be starting to work as intended, as some insurers have recently announced that they would resume business in the state. But that said, we don't know how the wildfires are going to impact this. Now, it's also worth noting that there's a one-year moratorium on dropping home insurance policies in the areas affected by the LA wildfires. The California Insurance Commissioner also called on insurance companies to rescind non-renewals that were issued in the 90 days before the wildfires and to also cancel pending non-renewals. These moves should help homeowners maintain coverage when they begin to rebuild after the fires. Sara Rathner: But this isn't a new story, is it? We've seen this happening all over the country. You already mentioned Florida, California, Louisiana. We also saw storms in Western North Carolina this summer and all these places that have gone through enormous tragedy. These extreme weather events end up jacking up insurance prices. Caitlin Constantine: Sadly, it's becoming more and more common. We've been seeing home insurance costs increase around the country as extreme weather becomes more destructive and happens more frequently. And it's not just the usual suspects like Florida, Louisiana, and California. Last month, the Senate Budget Committee released a report on climate change and insurance that indicated parts of Southern New England, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and the Carolinas may not be far behind. That report also warns that if these trends continue, we're going to start to see this impact property values. Sean Pyles: Caitlin, I know you have some personal experience with this issue. You live in Asheville, North Carolina, where Hurricane Helene brought so much destruction last fall. What have you seen in insurance rates in the wake of natural disasters that hit where you live? Caitlin Constantine: Well, it's a little soon for us to know how much our premiums will go up, but we do know that last week North Carolina's Insurance Commissioner approved an average rate of increase of about 15% across the state that will take effect by the middle of next year. So it's safe to say that many of us are going to pay more for home insurance. I will say that one thing we do know for sure posed a huge problem for us: a lack of flood insurance. So standard home insurance doesn't cover flood damage. You have to have flood insurance specifically for that. In an analysis done by a local nonprofit news group, Asheville Watchdog, they found that less than 1% of the buildings in Buncombe County, which is where Asheville is located, were covered by flood insurance. So that means that a significant number of people who lost homes and businesses when the French Broad River flooded will not have nearly enough money to rebuild. And Asheville's not alone in this regard. A new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that people who live near inland rivers and streams are more likely to go without flood insurance than people who live near the coast. And unfortunately, the report also found that people who live near rivers tend to have fewer resources to recover than do people who live near coasts. Sara Rathner: I think it's sometimes easy for people to think, "Well, I don't live in an area that's threatened by these kinds of events, so this insurance discussion isn't relevant to me." But it actually is. Can you tell us about how the insurance losses from disasters that might even be far from where you live end up being paid for by all of us? Caitlin Constantine: Well, it's important to remember that the point of insurance is to spread the cost of recovering and rebuilding over a wider group of people instead of expecting individuals to shoulder those costs entirely on their own. And so it follows that when more of us file bigger claims more frequently, the pool of money we're being paid out from has to increase as well, and that's when premiums go up. I think it's an indicator of the scope of this problem that the cost of paying for weather-related damage has become so high that the increase is being felt even in places that don't see a lot of extreme weather. Sara Rathner: Can you give us a sense of how much more everyone is paying because of these rolling crises? Caitlin Constantine: Well, we've been seeing home insurance rates increase almost across the board for a few years now. Partly that's been due to inflation, but partly it's due to the aforementioned increase in severe weather. In 2023, premiums increased by more than 11%, according to S&P Global. And then in 2024, our average rate for home insurance in the U.S. was $160 a month or a little over $1,900 a year, and that was calculated before the most recent disasters in L.A., Florida, and North Carolina. So we're getting ready to do our analysis for the upcoming year, and we fully expect to see rates go up once again. Sean Pyles: Let's talk about what all of this means for the cost of housing in this country. How do insurance costs play into the rising price you have to pay for a house or even to rent? Caitlin Constantine: Well, in recent years, insurance premiums have become so costly for so many people that they now are paying more for insurance and taxes than for the mortgage itself. And this is yet another factor that's making homeownership unaffordable for so many people, especially first-time buyers. It's not just that the house itself has become so much more expensive, but it's also much more expensive to insure it. And if you have a mortgage, you can't go without insurance. Plus, it's no longer a predictable expense, as so many of us have seen big increases in our home insurance year over year. So even if you can swing the expense one year, who knows if you're going to be able to manage it three or four years down the road? And renters, this is going to impact you as well. Your landlord is going to end up paying more to insure that property, and those costs will be passed down to you. Sean Pyles: Let's get to some practical advice for folks who are facing, or very well could face in the future, some soaring insurance bills for their homes. Caitlin, can you give us three or four top things people can do right now to try to lower those bills? Caitlin Constantine: So first of all, if you get hit with a big insurance bill, you definitely should shop around for a new policy. We recommend getting quotes from at least three insurers. You can start on our site. If you do a search for NerdWallet home insurance quotes, you'll get a page and you can get started by entering your zip code on the page that comes up. When you are getting quotes, it's really important to make sure that the quotes have comparable levels of coverage so that you are measuring apples to apples. If insurance is scarce in your area, which it very well could be, your best bet is going to be working with an independent insurance agent. They will know about all of the good insurers who sell in your area, not just the ones with the big ad budgets or the goofy mascots. And another money-saving tactic is raising your deductible. We've found that if you raise your deductible from $1,000 to $2,500, you can save on average nearly 13% on your premium. But if you do this, it's super important to make sure you can cover that expense. And really, it's important that you make sure you read your policy carefully. You might have a separate deductible for hail or wind damage. In fact, your policy is going to have all kinds of details about possible exclusions or limitations, so it's really critical to read it and make sure you understand it. One thing we don't recommend doing to save money is reducing how much coverage you have. It may be tempting to save money by lowering your coverage limits, but if disaster strikes, you're going to be very glad you're not underinsured. Sean Pyles: Caitlin Constantine, thank you so much for helping us out today. Caitlin Constantine: Thanks so much for having me. Sara Rathner: In a moment, we'll turn to this episode's money question segment, where we help you dig into whether high-yield savings accounts live up to the hype or if other types of savings accounts might be better for you. Sean Pyles: But before we get into that, we're going to ask you, nerdy listener, to pause — literally perhaps — to think about where you need some guidance with your money. Sara Rathner: Maybe you're wondering about how to compare different insurance companies, or you're trying to break yourself out of a bad financial habit but just can't seem to do it. Whatever your money question, we Nerds are here to help. Leave us a voicemail or text us on the Nerd hotline at 901-730-6373. That's 901-730-NERD. Or email us at [email protected].

And you can always email us at [email protected]. Sara Rathner: All right, let's get to this episode's money question segment. That's up next. Stay with us. Sean Pyles: We're back and answering your money questions to help you make smarter financial decisions. This episode's question comes from Aaron, who sent us an email. Here it is: "Hi, NerdWallet team. I wanted to reach out and share some thoughts on the topic I know you cover often, high-yield savings accounts. As someone who invests across platforms primarily with Vanguard, I have noticed that their Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund, while requiring a $3,000 minimum, consistently offers a higher annual return than most high-yield savings accounts. This raises a question in my mind. Aside from the convenience of short-term liquidity for bill payments or direct deposits, is there much advantage to high-yield savings accounts? The money market fund has no cap on purchases, is FDIC insured, and currently offers a 4.78% yield, which seems to outshine high-yield savings accounts for similar security." Sara Rathner: Aaron continues: "Thinking a bit deeper, it seems that financial institutions heavily market high-yield savings accounts, yet these often come in half a percent to 1% lower than similar money market funds. From what I see, this setup is quite profitable for banks. They enjoy liquidity from deposits while offering a quote-unquote high yield that still nets them a solid margin with minimal risk. High-yield savings accounts essentially allow institutions to secure a consistent return without needing to invest actively — a profit margin they might not achieve with conventional investment accounts. Given your expertise in high-yield savings, I'd love to hear your perspective. Do you agree with this assessment, and if so, why are high-yield accounts marketed as a beneficial product for the average saver?" To help us answer Aaron's question on this episode of the podcast, we are joined by Margarette Burnette. Margarette is a savings expert who has been writing about bank accounts for more than a decade. Her work has been featured in the Associated Press, USA Today, and other major media. Margarette, welcome to Smart Money. Margarette Burnette: Thank you for having me. I'm glad to be here. Sean Pyles: Hey Margarette. So let's start with the basics. What is the difference between a high-yield savings account and a money market account? Let's start with the money market account. What is it and where and how do you get one? Margarette Burnette: This is a great question, Sean, and I'm happy to answer it. But there is a point I'd like to clear up first in the terminology, because money market means different things depending on the context. So a money market mutual fund, like the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund, is an investment product. It's offered by a brokerage, not a bank. As a mutual fund, it pools investors' money into low-risk, short-term securities. So think government securities such as Treasury bills. This fund is not FDIC-insured. That's the key difference. A money market deposit account, on the other hand, is a bank product. It is a savings account that can sometimes come with check-writing features, but importantly, it is FDIC-insured. This means your money is protected by the federal government, and you can open one at a bank. Sean Pyles: And a high-yield savings account — this might seem obvious, especially because we do talk about them a lot on this show — but let's define those as well. Margarette Burnette: A high-yield savings account is also a bank product. It's simply a savings account that pays above-average rates. For example, the national average rate for savings accounts is currently less than half a percentage point, but you can find high-yield savings accounts that offer more than 4% annually. Also, like the money market deposit account, high-yield savings accounts are FDIC-insured, so your money is safe. Sara Rathner: Let's talk about this question of returns or interest that you would earn on money that you deposit in both of these types of accounts: money market deposit accounts — which is really just a type of savings account — and high-yield savings accounts, which of course are another type of savings account. Again, the listener was conflating money market deposit accounts with money market mutual funds. That’s a type of investment account. It's very different. So where do returns come from in a money market deposit account? Margarette Burnette: With money market deposit accounts, returns are based on interest rates set by the bank. They are generally tied to something called the federal funds rate, and rates can change at any time. That said, when you make your deposit, you typically know the rate you can expect, at least as of the day you make that deposit. Sara Rathner: And what about high-yield savings accounts — or really any savings accounts? Margarette Burnette: High-yield savings accounts work the same way as money market deposit accounts. Interest rates are set by banks and can change based on their market environment. Again, these are both different from money market mutual funds. Their returns are based on the performance of the securities the funds invest in, like Treasury bills, and these returns are called a yield. It's worth noting that future returns in a mutual fund are not guaranteed. Sean Pyles: So let's look at Aaron's example here. What would they want to think about when looking at these options for placing their money? Margarette Burnette: Here are a few things to think about. First, fees and minimum balances. You can find high-yield savings accounts that don't charge monthly fees and don't have minimum balance requirements. Money market mutual funds may charge an expense ratio, which is essentially a fee for the fund, and they may also have minimum balance requirements, as Aaron noted above. Next is your returns, of course. The higher your yield or the more interest you earn in the savings account, the faster your balance can grow. And finally, you'll want to think about access to your money. With savings accounts, if you have an ATM card, you may be able to go to an ATM machine and withdraw money instantly, or you could set up an automatic transfer that can be sent to a linked account within a day or so. Money market deposit accounts — those savings accounts — work similarly, with some giving you the ability to write a few checks each month. Sean Pyles: And now what about money market mutual funds? If someone does decide to put their money into one of these investment accounts, is getting your money from one of those accounts as easy as getting it from a money market deposit account or a high-yield savings account? Margarette Burnette: Some money market mutual funds do let you write checks as well, but there may be a minimum withdrawal requirement. Otherwise, to access your money, you may need to sell shares, and that could take a day or two to settle. I'll note that the savings accounts and money market deposit accounts with the highest rates do tend to be online accounts. So going to a local bank branch to withdraw money usually isn't an option, so you'll want to take that into account when making a decision about which one to open. Sean Pyles: Fortunately, our job here at NerdWallet is to make decisions like this easier. So I do want to mention that we have articles on the best high-yield savings accounts and the best money market deposit accounts on NerdWallet's website. You can check the NerdWallet rating, the APY, and any relevant bonus offers for each account, along with some of that other information we just talked about, like minimum balances and fees. And if you want, you can also look up money market mutual funds as well. We'll put links to those articles in today's show notes. Sara Rathner: Aaron also talks about what they think is behind the differences in the rates being offered. They think it's about profitability. Could you talk us through why a bank would be marketing or offering one versus the other? Margarette Burnette: Here's an important distinction. Banks market deposit products like checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market deposit accounts — they're FDIC insured for customers. Investment companies, on the other hand, market money market mutual funds. To be fair, these mutual funds are considered low-risk investments, but they don't come with insurance or guaranteed returns. Also, I should point out that some banks have investment arms, so it's possible to see both types of products under a similar brand. But the bank side would not market a mutual fund, and the investment side would not market a deposit product. Sean Pyles: And let's talk a bit about the role of FDIC insurance here. Can you lay that out for us, Margarette? Margarette Burnette: FDIC insurance is a safety net that guarantees your bank deposits up to $250,000 per depositor per bank. So even if the bank goes under, your money is protected. Now, there are regulations for mutual funds, but funds don't have that FDIC guarantee. Sean Pyles: And again, to get back to Aaron's question, it seems like they're making this apples-to-oranges comparison. They say they can get a return of 4.78% on their investment account, while savings accounts may offer a yield of closer to around 4% as of this recording. I want to quickly state that each account would serve a different purpose. It's generally not a great idea to have your savings in an investment account in case you do need to draw on that money in an emergency. Margarette Burnette: In general, I'd suggest folks poke around with a savings calculator to see how much you could earn with a rate of 4.5%, for example, compared with a rate of, say, 5% or 4%. Depending on how much money you have in your account, an account with a slightly higher rate may not net you that much more. Sean Pyles: So the lesson here is to do a bit of research to find those higher returns for yourself. They could go in either direction with these options. Margarette Burnette: Absolutely. This is especially true when you consider any fees that could be taken out of your returns with the money market mutual fund, for example. Sara Rathner: Do you have any other final advice for our listeners as they chase higher returns in an environment where interest rates are coming down, but sometimes they're faced with products that sound like they're the same thing but are actually completely different things? Margarette Burnette: That's very true. A couple of different issues here, and my answer to both is to shop around. It's not a given that money market mutual funds — which, again, are investment accounts — always offer better results than the best high-yield savings accounts. You'll want to check out up-to-date lists of the top high-yield savings accounts and money market deposit accounts because you may find some that offer better rates compared to the yields on money market mutual funds. In addition, if you know you won't need the money right away, you can consider looking at a certificate of deposit. If rates fall, then locking in today's CD rates could ultimately give you a better yield than all of the previous options. The key is you generally won't be able to make a withdrawal with CDs until the term is over. So, say for a one-year CD, you'd agree not to make a withdrawal for one year. Overall, depending on your goals, a CD, a high-yield savings account, money market deposit account, or money market mutual fund could be the right choice. Sean Pyles: Margarette, thank you so much for coming on and clarifying all these different accounts and who they might be best for. Margarette Burnette: Thank you.

Nvidia (NVDA-1.25%) CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth plunged $18 billion Monday as the chipmaker’s stock continues to free fall. Huang was worth $106.3 billion as of Monday morning, down nearly 15%, according to Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list. Huang has an approximately 3% stake in Nvidia. Shares of Nvidia were down nearly 16% to around $120 apiece just before mid-day. The rout caused the semiconductor giant’s market capitalization to fall by more than $465 billion to $2.97 trillion — the biggest single-day decline in market value for a company, beating its own previous record set last September. That drop puts it below Apple (AAPL-0.34%) and Microsoft (MSFT-6.12%) as the third-most valuable company in the world. Just last week, Nvidia surpassed Apple to become the world’s most valuable company. Global technology stocks suffered a widespread sell-off Monday that sent all three major U.S. indices tumbling, after investors grew concerned over a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML+3.69%), Broadcom (AVGO+4.34%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI+2.21%), Micron (MU+3.54%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+2.58%). The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged more than 600 points, or roughly 3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia, were also down more than 70 points, and the S&P 500 tumbled almost 2%. The sell-off was prompted by DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model rivaling OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META+1.62%) Llama 3.1 built using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. In December, the private company launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” However, they noted that the DeepSeek threat isn’t yet cause for concern, as U.S. companies remain ahead of the curve to achieving the next frontier of AI development: artificial general intelligence, or AGI.

Title: The Scoop: As Trump admin flexes muscle, Target retreats from DEI

Target is the latest national brand to announce plans to roll back long-standing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In a memo to employees, Target announced plans to end its three-year DEI goals and stop reporting to external groups focused on diversity, such as the Human Rights Campaign. The memo noted that Target will no longer support an internal program aimed at carrying more products from Black- and minority-owned businesses. These changes won’t lead to any layoffs, CNBC reported. But it’s already impacting the ways Target is interacting with the community. “Many years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,” Kiera Fernandez, chief community impact and equity officer at Target, wrote in the memo. “And as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future – all in service of driving Target’s growth and winning together.” Target is certainly not alone in its decision-making. Companies such as Tractor Supply, Walmart, Meta and McDonald’s have also scaled back or stopped their DEI commitments amid growing political and societal pressures. Soon after taking office, President Donald Trump ended the government’s DEI programs and placed federal officials in charge of those initiatives on leave. But not all companies are following this trend. For example, Costco recently voted overwhelmingly to continue supporting its DEI programs, with over 98% of shareholders rejecting a proposal to review its DEI risks. Why it matters: This is a moment of sea change as monumental as what we saw when George Floyd was murdered in 2020 and organizations across the country adopted DEI measures as a way of addressing historical inequities in business. To be clear, these changes have been evolving for some time, with a variety of companies slowly scaling back DEI efforts. Then came the Supreme Court decision rolling back affirmative action, which gave some legal cover for halting these programs. Then came societal pressure from activists including Robbie Starbuck. Then, with the election of Donald Trump, the pressures moved from cultural to governmental, with the feds threatening to investigate companies engaging in DEI in ways it deems “illegal.” This is a delicate moment that requires careful balancing. This is not an issue any one department or communicator can tackle. Legal, HR, internal and external communications must all collaborate to determine what is legal, what is just and how those items should be communicated. Target and Costco are one example of companies handling this very differently. Target, which had already been the target of anti-LGBTQ+ protests, retreated from DEI. Costco stood in its principles. Behind each decision, surely, were many agonized conversations, disagreements and lawyers. Your role as a communicator is to be the voice of your audiences. To show the data on their needs and how that may impact the business. This will be a difficult moment regardless of what your organization decides to do. Listen. Advocate in the best interests of the organization and your audiences. That sometimes is the more important role than any official statement.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) tumbled Monday after the release of a sophisticated artificial intelligence model from a Chinese startup prompted a reckoning on Wall Street regarding AI spending. Chinese company DeepSeek last week released R1, an AI model that appears to rival the capabilities of models from U.S. tech giants like OpenAI and Google despite running on fewer, less powerful chips. U.S. investors began to take notice of the model late last week, and over the weekend started to worry about what it means for richly valued U.S. tech stocks. Nvidia’s earnings and stock price have soared in the past two years as tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) have spent massively on the company's AI systems. DeepSeek has led investors to question whether all that spending was necessary and, if not, why it would continue. Nvidia stock was hammered by Monday’s sell-off. Shares tumbled nearly 17%, its largest one-day drop since the Covid-19 crash in March 2020. Monday’s sell-off wiped about $589 billion from Nvidia’s market cap, the largest loss in history. Wall Street analysts were mostly skeptical about DeepSeek and the sell-off it prompted, though their commentary often reflected uncertainty about the effects DeepSeek could have on the market. Citi analysts expressed doubt that DeepSeek had achieved its results without the most advanced chips. They maintained their "buy" rating on Nvidia stock and said they don't expect major U.S. AI companies to move away from using its advanced GPUs. Jefferies analysts, however, noted DeepSeek's success could press Silicon Valley management to "refocus on efficiency and ROI, meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026." Concern about future AI models requiring less computing power weighed on other high-flying AI stocks, including nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG), which slumped 28% and 21%, respectively. Nvidia competitor Broadcom (AVGO) also dropped about 17%.

Title: Why DeepSeek Is Sinking Nvidia Stock?

HANGZHOU, CHINA - JANUARY 27, 2025 - A Illustration photo shows DeepSeek and Nvidia LOGO in Hangzhou ... [+] City, Zhejiang Province, China, January 27, 2025. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) A few weeks ago, Chinese AI research lab DeepSeek released its open-source AI model, DeepSeek-R1, which has drawn significant attention in the tech world. According to a paper authored by the lab, the DeepSeek-R1 model outperforms cutting-edge models such as OpenAI’s o1 and Meta’s Llama AI models across multiple benchmarks. This is impressive, given that the model is also open-source, cost-effective, and requires significantly less computational power compared to its rivals. Now DeepSeek’s approach appears to have set off alarm bells in Silicon Valley, where most big tech giants have been relying more on brute force — amassing a larger stock of GPU chips and servers and running long model training periods. We believe this development could potentially have implications for Nvidia stock, the dominant player in the AI hardware space. Also, check out our analysis on: How Nvidia stock could drop 50%. DeepSeek has reportedly restructured the foundation of AI models, emphasizing software-driven resource optimization over hardware dependency. Although the company apparently utilizes tens of thousands of Nvidia’s H100 and H200 AI GPUs to train its models, it has faced constraints due to U.S. export controls limiting access to the latest chips. To overcome this, DeepSeek has implemented innovative engineering tweaks, such as custom communication schemes between chips to improve data transfer efficiency, memory-saving techniques, and reinforcement learning methods to minimize computational power requirements. These optimizations result in drastically lower costs compared to traditional large language models. Separately, up 45% in a week? See: What’s Happening With Tempus AI (TEM) Stock? This cost efficiency is reflected in the API pricing for DeepSeek-R1, which costs just $0.55 per million input tokens and $2.19 per million output tokens — significantly undercutting OpenAI’s API rates of $15 and $60, respectively. However, it remains unclear how quickly DeepSeek can expand its reach. The company’s commercial ambitions could face challenges due to the U.S. chip ban. More importantly, geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China could create trust issues for companies considering using Chinese-built large language models. These factors could limit DeepSeek’s penetration in Western markets. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. That being said, we believe that DeepSeek’s advancements could prompt a moment of reckoning for big tech companies. DeepSeek’s resource-efficient methods could force a reconsideration of brute-force AI strategies that rely on massive investments in computing power. Nvidia has been the largest beneficiary of this approach through the AI boom, with its GPUs regarded as the best performing for training and deploying AI models. Over the past two years, companies have funneled massive resources into building AI models, driving Nvidia’s revenue up by over 125% in fiscal year 2024 to $61 billion, with net margins nearing 50%. If the industry begins to take inspiration from the methods DeepSeek uses in its open-source models, we could very well see demand for AI Computing power cool off. The underlying economics of the broader AI ecosystem have been weak in the first place, and most of Nvidia’s customers likely aren’t generating meaningful returns on their investments. This could accelerate the shift toward more cost-effective, resource-optimized AI models. Now the increase in NVDA stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? We see a possibility that the “fear-of-missing-out” driven AI wave seen over the last two years could ease off due to diminishing incremental performance gains from larger models and also as the availability of high-quality training data becomes a bottleneck. This shift toward more efficient models could compound the impact of a potential slowdown for GPU makers such as Nvidia. Moreover, Nvidia also faces mounting competition from the likes of AMD as well as its own customers such as Amazon, who have been focusing on developing and deploying their own AI chips. While Nvidia does have a comprehensive software ecosystem around its AI processors, including programming languages that should help it better lock customers into its products, the company could face pressure. Nvidia’s premium valuation may not fully reflect these risks. We value Nvidia stock at about $93 per share, roughly 35% below the current market price.

Title: U.S. Retail Sales Projected to Increase by 4% in 2025, Reaching $5.2 Trillion Amid Economic Challenges

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Bain & Co. report details strategic resolutions for retailers, while also highlighting growth in non-store sales. Executive Editor According to a research report from the retail team at Bain & Co., nominal U.S. retail sales are pegged to see a 4 percent increase, year-over-year, in 2025 — “barring major macroeconomic or geopolitical shocks,” the firm noted. The report also included “resolutions” that successful retailers are focusing on this year. “That equates to around $5.2 trillion in estimated total sales in 2025,” the authors of the report said. “It’s a strong outlook, given a stagnant consumer outlook, tempering inflation, negative [year-over-year] employment trends, diminishing consumer savings, rising credit card delinquencies, elevated nondiscretionary costs and potential trade disruptions.” Related Articles Retail Atlas, a New Launchpad for Indie Designers, Opens at Westfield Century City Interior Design Féau Boiseries, the Parisian Atelier That Injected Opulence Into the Gilded Age, to Open in New York The Bain advisers said they expect growth will be fueled by a 10 percent increase in non-store sales, “while in-store sales will see modest 2 percent gains, led by general merchandise, apparel, and health and personal care stores.” You May Also Like The report was written and compiled by Bain partners Aaron Cheris, Kurt Grichel, Marc-André Kamel and Darrell Rigby as well as Stephanie Koszyk, practice director. “Retailers face a pivotal moment in 2025,” the report’s authors said. “The challenges of shifting consumer behaviors and demands, economic volatility, regulatory changes and trade complexities persist, reshaping the retail game. Successful businesses will go beyond the familiar, tapping into cutting-edge technologies, reimagining loyalty programs and fortifying supply chains against an unpredictable global backdrop.” The report said that while headwinds remain, “opportunities such as potential interest rate cuts, tax incentives and momentum from a strong 2024 holiday season suggest 2025 may be a year in which innovative moves can set the stage for lasting success.” Regarding resolutions for success, the Bain report said companies should take cues from “scale players” such as Walmart and Amazon (with large assortments, along with Costco). The report’s authors said these brands “have become the go-to for many shoppers, accounting for 57 percent of retail growth over the last three quarters and 17 percent of total U.S. retail sales in 2024 — a 6-percentage-point increase from 2014.” The firm said competing directly with these giants is harder than ever. “But by crafting a unique value proposition, retailers can carve out a winning position alongside them and capture significant rewards.” Bain said a clear and compelling value proposition starts “with the fundamentals, be it fast shipping, consistent quality or reliable digital experiences. Miss here, and irrelevance is almost inevitable.” The fundamentals include having balanced assortments that cater to customer preferences, which can boost sales by 2 to 5 percent. “Private brands are becoming an especially powerful tool, adding value through exclusivity,” Bain said noting that the firm’s research shows high-performing private brands can boost grocer share of wallet by 12 percentage points. Pricing and promotions will also be a key to success. “Strong value perception doesn’t always mean chasing the lowest price,” the report stated. “Retailers with a competitive advantage build structured pricing architectures that align with their customer and product strategies, balancing margin growth and market share. Personalized promotions tailored to individual preferences can further enhance value perception and influence buying behavior — ultimately improving ROI.” With the supply chain, Bain recommends diversifying supplier sourcing, which involves retailers adopting “right-shoring strategies” to optimize operations balancing cost, resilience and speed. The firm said the focus is not on shifting entirely to one region, but creating a flexible system capable of addressing priorities such as response times, market proximity, or resource access during volatility. Bain said its research showed that about 70 percent of retailers said they intend to augment onshoring or nearshoring in the next three years, with many U.S. companies lessening dependence on China in favor of regions such as India or North America. For example, Steve Madden plans to cut imports from China by 40 percent to 45 percent next year by establishing alternative production and sourcing in different countries. The footwear brand was one of the first to act in response to an announcement of possible tariffs on China from the administration of President Donald Trump.The report’s authors said optimizing networks with “digital twins” can also mitigate sourcing challenges. Digital twin platforms are virtual models that use real-time data to test the impact of different variables. Retailers are adopting these platforms to simulate disruptive scenarios such as weather or labor shortages, allowing for quick network adjustments and long-term strategic planning. Integrated with real-time tracking for comprehensive visibility, digital twins help pinpoint vulnerabilities, enhance processes and strengthen supply chains.In addition, predictive analytics are increasingly used for smarter inventory management, enabling retailers to anticipate demand shifts and optimize stock levels effectively. “Amid fast-changing consumer preferences and frequent disruptions, precise forecasting is crucial,” the report’s authors said. “AI-powered tools can help analyze demand in real-time, allowing retailers to dynamically adjust inventory placement to reduce transit times, lower costs and prevent costly stockouts or excess inventory. Bain’s experience shows custom AI forecasting models can cut excess inventory by 40 percent and boost accuracy by nearly 50 percent compared to manual planning.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

One of the biggest tech companies you’ve never heard of is helping you listen to this podcast. by Nilay Patel One of the biggest tech companies you’ve never heard of is helping you listen to this podcast. by Nilay Patel Today, I’m talking with Gary Smith, CEO of the networking company Ciena. You probably aren’t familiar with Ciena — the company isn’t really a household name. But every internet user has relied on the company’s products; in fact, every internet user has used its products. Ciena makes the hardware and software that make the fiber optic cables that connect the world light up with data. That’s everything from local fiber networks for broadband ISPs to the massive undersea cables that connect continents. There’s a high probability that this very podcast came to you over a Ciena-powered network, in fact — this company is everywhere. Gary himself is a fascinating character in this story. He joined Ciena in 1997, the year the company had an astonishingly successful IPO in the middle of the dotcom boom. And he became its CEO in 2001, right after the dotcom crash sent the company’s stock price — and the rest of the economy — into a tailspin. So Gary has had a front-row seat to the development of the internet as we know it, and Ciena has been there every step of the way — as telecoms and undersea cables first brought the planet online, all the way to the rise of cloud computing and, now, generative AI. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! You’re going to hear Gary and I talk a lot about something called WDM, or Wavelength Division Multiplexing, which is the fundamental technical innovation Ciena is built around. WDM is absolutely key to how the modern internet works, and most people have no idea it exists. The basic idea is that WDM uses multiple wavelengths of light to fit more data onto a single fiber optic cable, which allows those cables to deliver more and more information over time — you’ll hear Gary call it “virtualizing” a fiber optic cable, like you’re turning a single cable into two, or five, or 10. This is obviously hugely important as the world’s internet usage increases and data-hungry applications like streaming video and generative AI ramp up. Ciena didn’t invent WDM, but it was the first company to deploy it commercially in the ’90s — and I wanted to know how Gary was managing his investment in pushing that technology forward and whether he was thinking about the next kind of tech that might disrupt it. I also wanted to know about Ciena’s customers. There are only so many companies building deep sea cables and giant data centers, and it won’t surprise you that the customer set has largely shifted from telecom providers and ISPs to giant cloud computing companies like Meta and Google and Microsoft over the past few years. Just a few months ago, Meta announced it would pay $10 billion to build its own exclusive subsea cable stretching nearly 25,000 miles. Ciena sits right in the middle of that complicated relationship between industry and infrastructure, and I think you’ll find Gary’s perspective to be pretty unique. We also got into the fracturing state of the internet and what it means that people in different geographic locations, dependent on various levels of government control, experience the online world differently. Connecting cables stretching across continents means the people on either end of those cables might have very different ideas about the internet, and Ciena has to take all of that into account. See, I’m guessing you didn’t know about Ciena before, but almost every single Decoder idea is right here, sitting on the backbone of the internet. Okay, Ciena CEO Gary Smith. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Gary Smith, you’re the CEO of Ciena. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you. Good to be here. I am very excited to talk to you. The Decoder team and I were talking earlier about how we love stories of hidden companies that run the world, and Ciena very much feels like one of those companies. It is a huge player in networking. It’s a huge player in the future of our networks. There’s some AI to talk about. There’s undersea cables to talk about, which is always fun. Quickly, for everyone, describe what Ciena is and what you do. Basically, Ciena is the leading technology company in the world for providing high-speed connectivity. So if you think about all the networks that have been enabled around the internet and around the world, or, as you alluded to, submarine cables, Ciena is really the driving force behind that high-speed technology. Even with mobile connectivity, terrestrial connectivity, and submarine cable connectivity, we’re basically the best in the world at moving optical bits. I always think about it as two internets, right? There’s the internet we experience — the digital internet — and then there’s the physical internet: the actual cables and wires that connect our networks together and connect us together. That is Ciena’s business, running these cables, figuring out how to move data across them more quickly, and figuring out how to move more data across them. Ciena’s been around for a minute. How has the dynamic between what people are doing on the digital internet most consumers experience and what you need to do on the physical internet changed? It seems like something we don’t ever really get to talk about. I’m very curious to ask you about it. I think we consume most of the internet now in a mobile form, on our iPads, iPhones, or whatever. We still have some desktops, but it’s all laptops. The first point of connectivity there is mobile. It’s available to us all the time. But what we don’t think about is that it’s only mobile until it’s not. It needs to get terrestrialized to the nearest area where it comes down into terrestrial — typically fiber because to get really high speed, you need to use fiber. Wireless has some limitations around that. So basically, until it gets to any mobile application, its real objective is to get terrestrial into that cell tower as quickly as possible. Then, from the bottom of the cell tower is when all the magic starts, with the physical fiber cables and the networks that go around the world. If you have an inquiry, depending on what it is, that could require a different continent. That goes down through the cell tower and out across the sea and back to you. But that’s invisible to us all. We’re able to do it at such high speeds now that it’s transparent to the applications that you’re using. That’s the part I really want to dig into. Intellectually, I think I’ve always understood that. I think most people understand that there are servers and data centers elsewhere and we are communicating with them somehow. But at some point we need to hit a fiber line and actually talk to those servers. What I’m trying to understand is that there’s the consumer application layer of the internet — we’re all going to watch a bunch of Instagram reels or something. Then, there’s the internet we need to build to support that. What’s the relationship between those two? How often do you think, “I see the next set of applications that are coming on phones, I see the next set of devices that people may want to use. or I see the rise of streaming services. We better start building an internet that can support it?” That dynamic often seems subsumed in some cell carrier or data center conversations. It very rarely comes to the forefront. Because it’s the piece that connects all of this stuff. Everybody focuses on things like AI, Netflix, or whatever right now. How do you get those things to manifest themselves to the consumer and to enterprise? The reality is that it required a massive build-out over the last two decades for a fiber infrastructure that basically connects all these data centers together, that connects them through submarine cables, and connects them across countries. It has intelligence on it so it knows where to go to get that information. That has evolved over the last two decades. It continues to evolve because if you think about some of the business models that we now take for granted, like Uber, that wouldn’t be available if you couldn’t get instant response to it. Twenty years ago, that would not have been possible as a business model. There was an interesting point in the early 2000s where there was this massive overbuild of fiber capacity. It was sort of the telecom nuclear winter where we had more capacity than apparently we’d need for the next two decades. People built out all of these large fiber networks and no one came. But that enabled business models to take large amounts of bandwidth at low cost. That created business models like Amazon, which weren’t able to get stimulated and be sustainable until they had large amounts of dependable connectivity. So it’s constantly evolving with applications that are demanding much higher bandwidth. We’re in an era of that now with AI for sure. The networks have to catch up and facilitate that. Let me ask about the networks. Let’s say I want to build a network in some rural part of the country. Do I just call Ciena and say, “All right. We’re going to get to work. Go dig some trenches”? Do I run the network? Do you run the network? How does that work? We don’t run the network. Those are the service provider carriers. If you take North America as an example, there are hundreds of carriers that do the local last mile piece out in the rural areas. Then, there’s the Verizons, Comcasts, and AT&Ts of this world that then facilitate all of that connectivity to the consumer. We provide the technology that powers their networks basically. For them to get that high-speed connectivity, Ciena’s technology goes on the ends of those fiber cables that allows the speed and throughput to continue to drive the capacity. What we basically do is virtualize a single piece of fiber. So instead of having that little thread, which is about a hair thread in terms of weight and distance, we can multiply that many, many times. That’s hundreds of virtual fibers because of the technology we use around it. That’s enabled the whole scaling of the internet. It’s enabled the scaling of this global connectivity phenomenon that we have, and it’s at the center of scaling for AI connectivity now and into the future. That core piece of technology where you’re multiplexing and virtualizing the single piece of fiber, that was Ciena’s big technology bet. I believe it’s called WDM. Explain that to people very quickly. Basically, it’s virtualization. Where you’ve got one piece of fiber, [WDM] makes it look like multiple fibers. Depending on the distance and what you’re putting down, it can be hundreds of fibers, which is actually physically manifested as a single fiber. So you don’t need to put more fibers into the ground. With the technology we have on either end of it, you can just scale it up. So, it’s the virtualization of fiber that has enabled this almost seamless marriage between the applications, to your point, and the driving of all the network traffic with the actual network. Through our technology development, we’ve grown the ability to go do that faster than Moore’s Law. We now have a new piece of technology, called WaveLogic, that can do 1.6 terabits of data down a single piece of fiber. It’s always been explained to me that the fiber is the fiber, and we’re just sending light back and forth. It’s the pieces at the end that actually create the additional bandwidth to create that additional capability. Is that more or less true? Are you just focused on the bits at the end that talk to each other? Absolutely. There are technology developments within the fiber that assist that, for sure, and there’s been a lot of that development from companies like Corning in the fiber world. But basically, the magic is the technology that goes on the end of those fibers. When you think about it, if we had to scale by digging up the place every time we wanted to put more fibers in, it’s just not practical. We can get a tremendous amount of expansion and virtual capacity even on old fibers just by putting our technology on the end of it. You were talking about scaling faster than Moore’s Law, which is roughly a doubling every 18 months. Decoder listeners are very pedantic. They will tell me that’s not actually what Moore’s Law means, but I think that’s how you’re using it. I appreciate our listeners very much, but I don’t think that’s what applies here. You’re talking about a doubling of bandwidth every 18 months. Yes. You’ve been doing WDM since 1997, right? This is the technology bet of the company. Is it the capacity of WDM where you’re using multiple wavelengths of light across a single fiber? Is that what’s doubling? Yeah, it’s our ability to continue to drive that. When we first started, we could multiplex and keep it very simple. It was a single piece of fiber. We thought we could put four virtual fibers down there. That was revolutionary at the time. Many of the carriers we went to with that said, “Oh, that’s fantastic. We’ll never need more than that.” Then, we figured out how to do eight, then 16, then 32, then 64. And we’re way, way beyond that now. So what that means is you have that single piece of fiber that looks like 64 fibers. That’s enabled this massive scaling of architecture around the world. Then, we deploy that technology not just with local connectivity, but across the country and whole continents — 8,000, 10,000-mile submarine cables. We can support that kind of capacity across the submarine cables. Do you just sell these boxes to the telecom and data center providers and walk away? Do you have ongoing support? No, it’s a very integrated partnership. Most of the major carriers — I think 96 percent of the major carriers around the world — are Ciena customers. These are collaborations that we’ve worked on for multiple decades. We help manage the networks. We do a lot of the installation work for them. We do the planning. We have the software that actually manages the network and looks for predictive issues or challenges and switches automatically. If there are problems on certain fibers, it will detect that and switch it through. So, there’s a lot of underlying technology and collaboration between us and all the service providers. Also all of the hyperscalers. Pretty much all of the hyperscalers use Ciena to connect their data centers around the world. We partner with them as well on technology developments that are specific to their networks. You look at the hyperscalers, some of the largest networks in the world, and they’re very complicated, multi-continent, metro, long-haul, submarine cables. The biggest players and the biggest owners of capacity on submarine cables now are actually the cloud players. That used to be the traditional service providers, but now it’s the likes of Google and Meta that really own a lot of the global capacity on those submarine cables. This is the thing that I was talking about at the beginning. It seems so hard to understand, and it’s so interesting to talk to you about it because you’re in it. The internet we experience is obviously changing the dynamics of the internet we build. So. I experience my phone and there’s a bunch of stuff happening on some data center owned by Google, Microsoft, or whatever, and that means those companies now own most of the capacity of undersea cables. I don’t think that chain of events is intuitive unless you’re paying attention to it. But just talking to you for 13 minutes here, that seems very intuitive to you. It makes sense to you that they would have the capacity because I’m not sending nearly as much data as a consumer across the ocean. Do you see that changing? How fast has that grown? Describe that dynamic to me. Take the submarine cables as an example. It’s a good proxy for what’s happened here. From the 1980s to 2010, this was all funded by the service providers. It was a way of getting transatlantic phone conversations largely to Europe and a little bit to Asia. These companies, like British Telecom and AT&T, would have these cables, they would get together a consortium, and, as a syndicate, fund these submarine cables. With the advent of cloud, you had these players that wanted to have very high-speed connectivity. Take for example Meta, Google, Microsoft, or any of these players. If they were going to be in the European market, they needed to have very high speed, dedicated capacity. So in about 2010, you began to see the cloud players purchasing the capacity of those submarine cables. In the last five years or so, you’ve seen Google begin to own many of these cables, with Meta and others too. So, it evolved from, “Hey, it’s all this service provider and it’s just phone calls.” When you want to reach your aunt in Europe, in India, or whatever, then it’s just a phone call, which is a very small amount of data. The amount of data that’s now being required by these cloud players is multiple more times than that. You’ve got a lot of graphics going over it as well, which takes a lot of bandwidth. So the need for bandwidth has grown dramatically. It makes sense that the cloud players want to connect their data centers. If they’re putting a data center in India and want to connect it to North America, they want to own the connectivity for that, and it’s a much higher speed. So they’re not just buying the capacity. They’re actually taking control and owning the cables. So, there’s been sort of an evolution of that over the last five years. The first 10 years was, “Hey, we will take the capacity now.” Their networks are made up of a hybrid of owning the cable, owning some, or they rent it from the service providers. But you’ve now got, I think, 600-plus submarine cables around the world. You’ve got about 1.5 million kilometers of fiber at the bottom of the sea facilitating this, and the cloud players are really driving that marketplace now. That’s going to lead us into the inevitable conversation we’ll have about AI, but I just want to stay on this for one second. How has the verticalization, from “what we sell is virtualized compute capacity” down to “we will now own the cables in the ocean and verticalize our business and make sure we own it tip to tail,” changed your company? We’re looking at, “There’s WDM in 1997. This is the core innovation that lets us get more capacity out of the fiber networks. We’re initially going to sell that to telecom companies to do more phone calls or the early internet.” Now, multiple generations in, you’re selling it directly to Google to connect data centers so that it might run AI workloads.” It feels like that would have some pressure on your roadmaps and your go-to-market. How is that expressed? The evolution has been such that the first appreciators for that technology were obviously the service providers. As the internet began to gain traction in 2003, 2004, you began to see the cloud players get more interested in the network because if they’re going to monetize and get to the eyeballs that they wanted, the network actually becomes important to them. So, there’s been a steady increase in appreciation of that even prior to the AI piece, and they’ve become much more active. I mean, we really didn’t sell to the cloud players until about 10 years ago, and we had zero market share there. Now, we’ve got the main market share with a leading player in connecting data centers and cloud players around the world. Submarine cables are the same kind of thing. We really didn’t focus on the submarine cables with our technology because there wasn’t that much capacity being required. We’ve now got number one share in submarine cable connectivity around the world because they value very high-speed capacity. So the cloud players have gone from being a very small percentage of our business to over 50 percent of our business now being, directly or indirectly, cloud and hyperscalers. So it’s a very significant shift in the business, and that’s really accelerated in the last five years. I think this is a great time to ask the classic Decoder questions. You’re describing a shift in the business and a shift in your customers. How is Ciena organized now? What does that org chart look like? It’s been easier for us in some ways because we’ve always been the leading technology company, so it’s really about who appreciates that technology and collaborates. This shift to the submarine markets and to cloud players has generally been a good fit for Ciena because we move very quickly, and we’re at cutting-edge technology. The latest technology we have is actually on three-nanometer chips. We were the first company in the world to have a 3nm chip actually be used in the telecom space, and we’re now actually working on our second. We’ve got that out, it’s carrying traffic around the world, and we’re working on our second version of that. We’ve always been at the leading edge of technology, and it really is a natural fit with these cloud players. So, we’re organized very simply. We have a large-service provider team around the world, a dedicated team for the hyperscalers and cloud, and an engineering team that works with them on co-development and stuff with that kind of technology. I’m a great believer in simplicity of organizational design. So, we have a very simple organizational structure that’s evolved to address that. That’s how we’re able to scale as quickly as we have. You’ve got the two big markets — the telecoms and the hyperscalers — and you have the engineering organization. I’m assuming the telecoms and the cloud providers want different things. How is that expressed in what the engineering organization goes off and builds? It’s interesting. There’s a lot of commonality about what they want. If you think about it from an engineering point of view and the latest WaveLogic technology we just developed, we actually take that same technology and we deploy it in slightly different variants to both markets. So, we get a better scale of development over that. Obviously, we develop a single chip and then do variants of it for specific applications that they want, but that same technology is essentially consumed across the service provider world because they all want the same thing: better economics across the fiber that they’ve got and increased bandwidth. The particular sensitivity, I would say — what’s really the difference between the two markets — is the cloud players are much more focused on power, which we all hear about from a data center point of view. It manifests itself exactly the same way in the telecom networks. We do variants that are power optimized for the cloud players, but that’s the predominant difference. That’s just taking the same core technology and doing a different variant of it that’s prioritized around power. That enables us to scale the development and the rest of it. So, we have a single global engineering team focused on this core technology. Ciena has always been a very focused player. We’ve been very focused on just high-speed connectivity. This has enabled us when most of our competitors are trying to do mobile or other kinds of things. For the past three decades, we just wanted to be the best in the world at moving optical bits at a high speed. The opportunity we have now is increasingly into the campus and potentially even inside the data center with that same core technology, and that’s all in front of us. We get zero revenue from there right now. But it’s the same customers, so that’s an exciting opportunity for us in the future. I want to talk about that a little bit more, but can I just ask one more question? You said power. That suggests to me that you’re building a data center, you have an energy budget, and then you hold all the vendors to some number on the line to make sure you hit your energy budget. You’re feeling that too, even as the person is like, “Here’s the box that connects to the fiber line.” Yes. It manifests itself differently obviously, but everybody talks about the data centers and the power and the rest of it. Everybody is very focused on that for obvious reasons. But that same issue deploys when they come out onto the network too. You put amplifiers on the fiber to do that, and around these amplification sites, they want super low power because they are constrained around power and space. I’m assuming they would rather spend their power budget on running the GPUs as hot as they can. Exactly. They don’t want to spend it on the communications part, or they want to spend as little as possible on that. They want it optimized. We’re able to do that for them in terms of the footprint of the technology. We can now get down on a single plug what used to be a rack of cords. Quite literally, a six-foot-wide rack on a single plug, that same capacity. That’s what we’ve evolved over the last two decades with. So, we’re well placed with these guys to continue to drive down the power usage on the network, not just in the data center. How big is Ciena? How many people are on all of these various teams? We’re close to about 10,000 people worldwide. We’re very distributed. This year’s consensus revenue is about $4.4 billion, something like that. We’re profitable, and we have a strong balance sheet. We very much invest directly into this technology. Because we’ve been such a focused player at it, we felt that this high-speed connectivity would be appreciated eventually, and it’s really coming into its own now. You have to make these investments for the long term. Some of our technologies take five-plus years to evolve. We’re fortunate in this time right now. It’s a good intersection point where high-speed technology is super appreciated. Is that an even split? Is it 3,300 in engineering, 3,300 in hyperscaler sales- No, it’s basically predominantly engineering. As you can imagine, this kind of technology is more about engineering, so more than half of our team are engineering talent. We’ve got applications engineers at the front end who help make sure we understand the applications and work with the customers on that, but more than half is engineering. As I said to you earlier on, it’s a very simple structure. One of the things that really strikes me is there is this core enabling invention, WDM. The company is built around it. Ciena’s made a few acquisitions over the years. You’ve led a few of them. There was one in 2019 for Centina Systems. Is WDM still the heart of it? Is that proprietary Ciena we’re building around it? Is there a next way to use fiber that’s coming? No, it’s basically the journey that we’re on. We’ve made multiple acquisitions, but it’s all been about the core mission, which is high-speed connectivity and the things we need around that. A lot of the acquisitions have been around vertical integration of that, so we have more control over it. It’s not just the core technology. It’s the things around it that you need to do. Most of those surrounding technologies were where we could focus and provide competitive advantage by doing something to them. Over the years, we’ve worked very carefully at acquisitions and organic developments that make us vertically integrated so we can control that. There’s advantages to control and scale, but what really drove us was that we think we can put competitive advantages in each of the technologies that we gather around the core technology, if that makes sense. The reason I’m asking that is because often you might want to buy a company that’s early to the next turn, but it seems like WDM is still the heart of what you’re doing, and you don’t see a finish line there. Basically, it’s this technology. The actual variant that we focus on is the coherent technology, and that’s what has enabled this DWDM to scale so much. But there are other technologies around it that we’ve developed, like the SerDes — the Serializer / Deserializer — and the kinds of things that are for analog conversion, which is incredibly difficult to do. We’ve got some of the best technology in the world around that. It’s the moat that you put around that, but it’s not the next thing. We think there’s a lot of headroom, particularly because this technology is all deployed right now. Think about it outside the data center. So as soon as it wants to present outside the data center, that’s Ciena. The opportunities we have with the same kinds of technology are now becoming apparent inside the campus — these campuses are getting super big now — and eventually will be inside the data center. That’s because the GPU and compute investment that’s going on requires higher and higher speed over longer and longer distances, even in some of these data centers. First of all, they’re enormous. You’ve got fiber going around them, sometimes multiple kilometers within a single data center with that fiber getting wrapped around. We think there’s an intersection point for our technology there. The technology there right now, which is just called direct-connect, is required to connect all of the racks within the data center and the intra-data center. The physics of that is getting challenged as these GPUs require higher and higher speed. So, we think there’s a real opportunity for us to intersect that, to your point, with the same kind of core technology that requires some variations over the next 1–3 years. Let me ask you the classic Decoder question, and then I want to get into that. You’ve been at Ciena for a long time. I think you’ve been there for 30 years. You’ve been the CEO for almost 25 now. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework? Depends on what kind of decision it is, right? Not all decisions are equal. I very much feel that it’s a team game. When we make strategic decisions — which I think is what you’re alluding to with how we invest and what long-term things we’re focused on — we’re strategically aligned around what we want to go do. We’re a very focused company. Back to the point I was making earlier, I think people appreciate the best of breed, and we want to be the best in the world at what we do. The north star is very clear to us. Then, it’s about what things we need to do to get out into the future on that. From that point of view, the decision making is somewhat easier because we know we’ve chopped the field, so we know where we’re playing on. There’s not some great conversation about adjacencies and things that we might want to get into; it’s all based on our core technology. To answer your question, if it’s something strategic around those investments, it’s always a team game. We’re super collaborative. It’s how we work and get cross-functional input into all of those things. So, it’s a process. But I would say that I think the role of a CEO sometimes is to say, “Okay. We’ve had the debate. This is the overall perspective of what we want to do. Let’s go.” I think part of the role of the CEO is to facilitate the best conversations and discussions and then help drive to a conclusion. Let me give you a hypothetical that I suspect you will shrug off, but I’m going to try anyway. You’re looking at two big groups of clients. You’ve got your telecom companies, and you’ve got your big cloud providers who are all racing into AI. You have some opportunity to grow that business by going into the data centers, not just landing the fiber at the doorstep. That seems like the much richer opportunity. I look at the state of the telecoms in the United States, for example. They’re not growing much, right? They’re churning customers between them. It would seem very obvious that your entire team would say, “Don’t worry about them so much. We need to put all of our focus on the AI providers because that is where there’s growth using our same core technology.” But then you still have to service the telecom customers, I imagine. How do you balance that out? How do you make that decision to say, “These investments are going to go over here?” It’s actually much easier for us because, back to the point I was making, it’s the same kind of core technology. When we move the ball down the field for the cloud players, we can apply that to the service provider space because it’s the same core technology. In terms of their needs, there are actually a lot of similarities. Another way of thinking about this is when we start talking about the data center and the rest of it, we provide optical systems where we do the whole thing for the service providers. And we do that pretty much for the cloud players too. So we do all of the systems for the software, what we call the WDM modem technology, and the line systems. We do all of that, and often we’ll install it, support it, and maintain it. We do that for service providers and we do that for the cloud players. Then, to the point around the opportunity in the data center, it’s not necessarily about providing those complete systems. It’s taking them, putting them in plugs, and then putting them in components. So it’s a different kind of play, but it’s still the core technology. So, anything you do to advance that also applies to our systems business, and our systems business is both service provider and in the cloud. You don’t have to make the “which are your favorite children?” kind of choice, which is where you were going with that. I think that’s another benefit of a company staying super focused on its core technology and understanding what value we bring to the world. That is very difficult for anybody else to replicate, Well, can I ask you about that? Because it feels like the Trump administration is incoming. By the time people listen to this, he will have been inaugurated and we’ll be off to the races with a new kind of business climate here in the United States. Mergers will be in fashion again. They have not been in fashion over the past four years. If I was running Google or Microsoft, I would say, “Well, this is the core technology that’s going to make my data center more efficient and move data faster on my cable. I’m just going to buy this company.” Have you been approached to be acquired? Well, I’m not going to– I’m just wondering because I can see why over the past several years, all of that conversation has chilled. But it’s also remarkable to me that a company like Ciena has remained independent for 30 years. That used to be the conversation all the time. Think about 20 years ago. I’m not sure some of your viewers will remember some of these names: Lucent, Alcatel, Nortel, even Nokia. The model was all what I call the “generalist model.” They were actually spin outs from their phone companies like Marconi. Northern Telecom came out of Canada. So with the model, we had to be end to end. You had to put switches, routers, handsets, mobile infrastructure, and this thing called transport. We said when we started, “No, we’re going to just focus on the transport piece because we think it can get to scale.” What’s happened over the last two decades is that the generalists, because they couldn’t afford to be at the cutting edge in each of those areas, have all struggled. You trace the genesis of all of those companies now and basically they’re all in Nokia. With Alcatel and Lucent and all the rest of them, the music stopped and that’s where they ended up. The point I’m making about that is the world’s too competitive now for the whole end-to-end thing and being a generalist supplier. It just absolutely is. They used to say to us, “Well, when are you going to get bought?” We used to say, “Listen, we’re a public company. We have all the fiduciary responsibilities that you would expect with a public company, but we think we can get to scale and be a real company just doing what we’re doing.” Now, these things take a while and we’ve been public for 25 years, but we’re at a point now where we absolutely have scale. We’re very strong financially. We can invest in this kind of technology. We’ve got the number one market share in all the key markets that we want to play in. So, we’ve got a good opportunity to drive shareholder value from here. Do you think that DWDM, the multiplexing you do to virtualize the fiber, is enough of a moat? You were describing the other acquisitions you’ve made and how you surround the core technology with other things to enter different markets as the moat. But is that core technology something that… I don’t know if Mark Zuckerberg woke up one morning and was like, “screw it, I’m open sourcing it,” he could just do it? Or is that more specialized? There are other companies that have variants of this technology, for sure. It’s just that we’re able to implement it faster and quicker and better than anybody else, and we have the core competencies around it. A bit of an analogy is TSMC. People kind of know how to do [what TSMC does], but they can’t do it, right? You can go to ASML and ask for a machine and that’s not where it stops. Yeah. Because it’s people, and it’s the folks that understand that it’s the five, 10 percent of each of these areas that really make the difference to things when you put it and all the things we’ve built around it all together. So like with any of these things, it’s a confluence that makes up the competitive advantage. It’s when you get down to the real technologies. It’s all of those things that provide the moat for us. It’s the fact that we’re focused and the fact that we’re now so embedded with these key cloud and technology companies and were part of the collaboration process around the evolution of their networks. It’s the relationships that you build up, that trusted relationship and the technology collaboration over time. That’s why we think we’ve got an opportunity to take that into a whole new market for us with the campus and eventually inside the data center. I want to talk about two things that seem like they’re going to happen to the hyperscalers, in particular, over the next four, 10 years. One of them has a lot to do with subsea cables and the other one is obviously AI. Let’s start with subsea cables. If I look broadly at our nation’s big companies — Amazon, Google, Meta, Apple — they’re about to enter into a world where an emboldened Donald Trump wants to just reset the international order. They own cables that connect our continents together. There’s a lot of people who want to break the internet apart in different ways. We might ban TikTok. We might not ban TikTok. China doesn’t allow our apps there. There’s a lot of interest in what is happening on our networks that connect our countries together and who gets what where. Then there’s just the reality that they are wires in the ground. Bad things happen to them. They get cut. There are wars. How much of that do you engage with personally? How much do you think about, “Okay. There are some fraught geopolitics that are about to change. I need to make some decisions to get ahead of it, be aware of it, insulate myself against it, or insulate Ciena against it?” How much of your time do you spend on that? I mean, there are the headings of things you can control and then things that you can’t control but need to be mindful of, right? It’s definitely in that second list. I could argue that over the last five or 10 years we’ve had quite a lot of geopolitical dynamics going on. We are mindful of that, particularly because we operate in multiple countries, so 80 countries around the world. Our technology is widely deployed. We are mindful of those kinds of dynamics, and I’ll give you an example. We made a decision in the early 2000s that we would not go in and be a provider to the Chinese market for its major service providers. There was a whole set of thought processes that went into that. One of our competitors at the time was Huawei and it was just emerging. I don’t think people appreciate this, but the first real iteration of technology that Huawei came out with was actually in our space, so way before all the mobile stuff and all the other omnipotent things that it’s now doing. So around 2003 we said, “What’s this company, what are they doing, and how is it achieving price points that are just lower than our cost?” Turns out that we’re being subsidized by the Chinese government, right? It’s like we’ve seen this movie several times since 2003. So one of the thought processes that we had, just to give you an illustration , we said, “You know what? We will not compete with it directly in the China market. It obviously wants us there because we’ve got leading technology and the rest of it. We’re actually not going to manufacture in China either. So we’re going to be the antithesis, if you like, of Huawei in every single way. We’re going to be the alternative that’s not a Chinese manufacturer, and we won’t operate there.” That was a very controversial thing. You imagine a young company that’s just gone public and going, “Hang on a minute, why are you not going into the largest market and fastest growing telecom market in the world?” But we had the strength of our convictions. It’s taken a while, but I think largely that was a good decision for us because we didn’t get distracted by that Chinese market. They’ll give you 10 percent of that market, but they’ll make sure you won’t get anything else, and you’ll partner with a local partner. I spent a lot of time in Asia. I lived in Asia for a number of years before I came to Ciena. And I saw that movie, to your point, play out in so many different ways. I was super sensitive to that, as was the team. So, that is an instance of us doing something because of the geopolitical dynamics at the time and us making a decision. You don’t know how that’s going to play out because things can change., You’ve just got to be smart around what you think is the best thing for the shareholders and your company and stick to it. Do you mostly follow the lead of the clients? Do you have your own points of view on geopolitics? I’m thinking of things like when you land the cable in Europe and your devices there decoding all the traffic that there are a number of European spy agencies that might want to sit right next to that. The NSA in our country would love to sit right next to that. When you land in other countries that have different kinds of privacy and security concerns, they might want to be a part of that. Is that something where you say, “Look, Meta owns this cable. You talk to Meta. We’re going to do what the client says,” or is that, “We are simply not going to build these cables in certain devices”? We’re actually pretty fortunate that we don’t have to make some of those tough decisions because it’s not our cable. So to your point — But the data going over the cable, that’s you, right? You’re encoding and decoding it? Yeah, that’s what we’re doing, but even that technology is owned by the customer. We sold that to the customer, and what they do with it is entirely up to them. We don’t have control over that. It’s their network.. It’s their property. You think about these submarine cables. Someone owns the cable, and we put the technology on the end of it. It’s their technology. They own that, and they run it as well. We don’t run it. So they run those networks. We’re fortunate in that we’ve always been able to stay one step behind some of those dilemma questions. It’s not something we have to opine on. When you think about the actual cables, they’re in international waters. What’s the longest one that you operate? I think it’s about 10,000 kilometers. Some of these cables are around the Pacific where you get the big distances, so they are very, very long cables. A lot of them stop off on different islands and places and spur off. Some of the new cables going in are spurring off in different places. We’ve also developed a technology that overlays that provides for resilience. So if you get a cut on a particular cable, then we can reroute it depending on the architecture. It’s called GeoMesh. It’s software and technology that’s embedded into our core offerings and enables us to provide resilience across some of those submarine cable links. In the normal run of things, you get I think something like 100-plus faults a year, mainly trawlers dragging their anchors on a fiber cable because they’re buried at the bottom of the sea until they’re not. I mean, they’ve got to come up somewhere. Typically, it’s in the shallower waters where you’ll get some fishing vessel come across it. Do you ever get angry sharks? Do you ever get a text message like “shark attack brought down the network?” Actually, that’s a common question I get asked around it. There is a section around fish attacks. I think it’s zero. I’m sure there are some examples of it that someone can point to over the last three decades, but I’ve never heard of it personally. I think they’ve got other things to worry about than these little tiny... it’s about the size of a big hosepipe, so I don’t think it’d be particularly interesting to them. We have this phrase that we’ve been using at The Verge, my friend Casey Newton came up with it ages ago. He calls it the “Splinternet,” where we perceive one cohesive internet, but really we’re fracturing. We’re fracturing into continent-specific, country-specific internets. As I talked to you about the cloud providers, it’s very obvious to me that we now have a number of private internets operating at high speed around the world that are just owned and controlled by single companies. You have a long view of the internet. You are one of the few guests on Decoder who’s ever just straight up talked about Alcatel. You have a long view of the internet, how we’ve grown it, and what it’s for. The telecoms, by and large, were national champions, right? That’s how they have thought about themselves. Even in the United States, that’s how they’ve thought about themselves. That’s where they came from. There’s a new kind of nationalism in America around our tech giants in the Trump administration. Mark Zuckerberg says, “I want the Trump administration to go fight the European regulators on my behalf.” That’s new, it hasn’t come up before. We’ll see if this jacket fits. He’s trying it on. But the way we build networks is an expression of national capability. We haven’t experienced that too much as the internet. It’s been one global internet that connects all, and then we do whatever we want and set our borders. But we haven’t actually split the networks apart. But now you’ve got big cloud provider private networks. You do have rising nationalism around the world. You just have a pulling apart of the internet. Is that affecting how you are building networks or how your clients are asking you to build networks? I totally understand the notion, and I think what you’ve got is that a disproportionate amount — this is sort of an English understatement — of the innovation and development for all of this has been done in the US, amongst all these technology companies, for sure. Now, the big cloud players are investing in that network because that’s their business model, and the network is becoming more and more important. When we talk about the network, to your point, we talk about it in this homogeneous form. But if you think about this in the context of some of the large markets that the US cloud players are trying to get into… take places like India. When they enter the Indian market, they are dependent upon connectivity from the local carriers. So they can tip up with the submarine cables and the landing stations, but then it’s, “How do I get connected to all the people I need to get connected to in India enterprise and consumer?” They are then dependent on the local carriers, be it Bharti, Jio, Vodafone Idea, some of the wholesale carriers that are also there, and fiber. There’s always going to be an interrelationship because as omnipotent as all of these cloud players are, they’re not going to be able to connect to everybody’s home across the planet. So you’ve always got this interplay between service providers and the cloud players. What often happens there is that in some of these countries, the service provider will provide a specific network for the cloud player, and they call it a Managed Optical Fiber Network, or MOFN. And we help facilitate that. It’s our technology, so it matches all of their global networks. But it’s owned and operated by the local service provider to support Meta, Google, Microsoft, etc. Increasingly, I’d argue you’re seeing that interdependency work. So, I wouldn’t say it’s the counter-argument to the idea that we’re all splitting up because at the end of the day, to get to the consumers around the world, these service providers are not going away in that regard. That’s not going to change. They are the only ones that can provide that connectivity ultimately, be it the enterprise or the consumer. I’m fascinated by this because it does seem like the overall geopolitical dynamics of the world are changing, and the internet will change with it. I just keep coming back to the question I started with, which is about how the experience we have on the digital internet obviously impacts the physical internet that you are responsible for building. I’m always trying to find the touchpoints between the two. The way we architect networks in India has a direct relationship to the Indian internet that those users experience, and it seems like those things are, if not diverging completely between different countries, certainly beginning down different paths. That, to me, seems utterly fascinating. I want to end with AI here. As you think about entering their data centers and saying, “We can envision some new high bandwidth, high capacity workloads in these data centers,” which for the past 15 years we have not really come up with massive new ones outside of streaming video. Streaming video is a lot, but that’s basically what we came up with. Now there’s some new ones in AI that might hit all kinds of new industries. Do you think that that is just an exponential rise in how much capacity we need, how much power we’ll need to use, how much networking capacity that we’ll sustain? Or is it, to make the comparison earlier to dark fiber, building out a lot of capacity that we’ll eventually use over time? That’s a great question. Having lived through the previous period of the telecom nuclear winter where we built out all this capacity — and as it turned out, no one came — it did facilitate all these business models that wouldn’t have accelerated without that glut of capacity. I get asked the question if we’re in another bubble around all of these data centers. Specifically around the data center piece, I think there’s an insatiable demand for compute, to build out compute power. These things always take longer than we all think to monetize and the rest of it, so we’re probably going to go through some iterations. But to answer your real question, I’m actually of the opposite view this time round. I think we’re underestimating the amount of traffic and bandwidth that will be required to go do this because we’re already seeing a clip up in cloud traffic. We’re pretty well placed to see that. Now, how much of that could I attribute to AI? Some of it is, but I’ve got no way of really discerning which bit is which, and it’s not our network. But there’s a definite uptick in cloud traffic just to connect to all of these data centers. We are absolutely seeing that, and I think that’s going to continue because you’ve got a lot more data centers coming online in the next 18 months, or two years around the world. If they’re going to monetize any of that, they’ve got to all be connected for learning, training, and the rest of it. That’s before you even see the applications for medical use or verticalization, whatever you want to call it. Using your ChatGPTs is generating traffic, sure. But then you start to get to any of that medical usage, for example, and the amount of graphics that are required. Graphics are about 10–20 times more bandwidth-consuming than normal data. So, if you start to get to the monetization of that through these vertical applications, I think we’re underestimating the amount of traffic that’s going to be there. When you plan out growth for the company — obviously, you’re a public company, so you have to do it out in front of everyone and talk about risk — in your most optimistic view, is it sustainable, the rate of demand that you see now? You’re saying we’re underestimating it. I look at it maybe a bit more cynically, which is, “Wow, we are building a lot of capacity against business models that don’t exist.” OpenAI has yet to turn $1 in profit, and it wants all of the power that the world can generate. It wants every GPU that Nvidia can build. That’s a lot, right? There’s an inherent promise there that this will all pay off. Maybe you would call that a bubble or maybe you won’t. I’m just looking at it more mathematically. A lot of companies are going to sell a lot of things to these data centers. We’re going to build a lot of capacity, and maybe at some point we will have built enough or not enough or something will happen, but that will come to an end. Then a company like yours is saying, “Well, we’ve had this rate of growth and now maybe it’s plateaued or maybe it’s going down.” How are you thinking about that? I think about it like this: Don’t confuse compute capacity with the network. The network is always the afterthought to all of this, right? It’s, “Oh my gosh, I do actually need to connect these data centers.” So what’s the hierarchy of their thought process? It’s, “I need the compute. I need the power. I need the space.” Those are the things that are driving their decision. Then by the way, “Oh my gosh, I need to connect these data centers right now.” I’m being flippant, but it is down there. I’d like to tell you it was right up there, but it isn’t. In the answer to this question, I think that’s actually a good thing. We only get there when they need it. They’re not building out these enormous capacities because we see it. We’re putting capacity out there, and they’re putting traffic down it. So I take real comfort from that, having lived through 2002 and 2003 when our revenues went down from something like $1.6 billion to about $300 million in one year. I’ve still got the scars from that, so I’m particularly sensitive to this. This is not the same dynamic. They are actually putting capacity out, and as fast as we put it out there, traffic is coming through it. To your point and to what a lot of other folks are saying, is it going to get overheated in terms of the GPU stuff and the data centers and the rest of it? In my personal opinion? Absolutely. Will there be a bit of a tail off in all of that? Absolutely. Will it take longer for applications in the AI world to truly generate the economics? Absolutely. But we’re not banking on that. We’re just seeing this nice steady growth in bandwidth, which I think will pervade throughout. Here’s another way of answering your question. Over the last two decades, bandwidth has grown about 20, 30 percent a year and is not cyclical. When you think about it, it shouldn’t be cyclical, should it? We’re just putting more and more applications out, we’re using our phones for more stuff, more people are getting phones, and all these devices are now connected. That has been very steady and consistent throughout. Even when you get an economic downturn, it continues at about that pace. What we’re talking about here is the advent of AI on top of that. Exactly what is it going to be? No one really knows. There’s all these models, but no one really knows. But it’s reasonable to assume that it’s going to come on top of that and could push us to 30, 40 percent bandwidth growth per year, and I think that’s going to be pretty sustainable. When you think about all the promise of AI, the real trick to it is you start putting any graphics down it. Every time you hear [Google CEO] Sundar Pichai say multi-modal AI, I can see the dollar signs floating through the offices over there. I love it. We’re basically planning our business on what we see, and we’ve taken our growth rates up. Typically, this business has grown. We’ve grown about 7 or 8 percent. We’re now saying it’s going to grow 8 to 11 percent over the next three years, and that’s without any massive entry into the data center space or anything else. It’s just what we see from a cloud growth point of view. You’ve talked a lot about entering the data center using the same core technology that you use for the undersea cables and the telecom providers. What are the barriers to doing that and what were the things you assessed when you thought, “Okay. This is the market we have to address”? The barriers to entry there are that you’ve got a technology called direct-connect, which has been well ensconced there really since the start of communication in data centers. You’ve got an ecosystem there that is going to be designed to elongate that for as long as possible, and the customers want to keep it for as long as possible. With the analytics we’ve done on it and working with them, they think that there’s going to be an intersection point where the physics of that gets to the point where it’s not sustainable. We think we’ve got to the point with power and space where there’s a good intersection. So it’s the analytics around that and working with two or three of these players who are already our customers but outside the data center. Is that them coming to you or are you going to them? A little bit of both. We have strong relationships with them, so that collaboration has been there. We’re realistic about it. The existing way of working and that direct-connect? That’s not going away. That’s probably still the majority of applications for it. So you’re looking at what the subset of corner-case applications are for this kind of high-speed connectivity. But even a small part of that is massive for us and massive from a scale point of view given the amount of spend that’s gone on in that space. It’s always about taking risks when that market isn’t there right now, but if you wait until that market appears, it’s too late. If you’re waiting for, “Oh, what’s the market share of this and what’s the growth rate?” At the end of the day, you’ve just got to go with what your intuition is and what you’re hearing and seeing from the customers and the rest. So we’ve got our first iteration of technology for this coming out at the end of the year. That’s a bet that we placed two, three years ago. As you know, the timing takes a while with some of these chip designs and stuff. You have to guess where the market’s going to go, not where it is right now. There’s always an element of risk to it. Listen, having gone through some of this before, you’re never going to get it completely right. You just have to be in the right vector, pay attention, and tweak along the way around it. So we’re listening intently. Gary, this was an incredible conversation. You’re going to have to come back sometime. I could talk to you about this for hours and hours. Love to. I enjoyed it, Nilay. Good questions. Good stuff. We’ll see. We should have you back a couple of years from now and see how stressed you are about these undersea cables. I think that would be very interesting. We’re certainly in for some entertainment, aren’t we? I know what we’re writing about for the next four years. Gary, this is amazing. Thank you so much.

Posted on 01/27/2025 6:27:08 AM PST by lasereye Nasdaq futures plunged on Monday to lead a stock rout on Wall Street as a Chinese startup rattled faith in US leadership and profitability in AI, taking a hammer to Nvidia (NVDA) and other Big Tech stocks. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) sank nearly 4%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) tumbled over 2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) fell 0.9%, or about 380 points, on the heels of a winning week for the major gauges. Markets have been rattled by claims by China's DeepSeek that its AI assistant uses cheaper chips and less data than leading models, but performs equally well. A surge in DeepSeek's popularity has spurred a scramble by investors to reassess bets that AI demand-driven growth will keep fueling gains for stocks. AI bellwether Nvidia's shares tumbled over 11% in pre-market trading, as chip-related names took a bruising. ASML lost 9%, while Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron Technology (MU) also got hammered. Shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) both slid about 6% amid worries about megacaps' hefty investment in AI. Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN) also lost ground as techs sold off across the board. Big Tech earnings season kicks off this week, highlighted by results from Apple (AAPL), Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft. Eyes will be on guidance for future profit as DeepSeek casts doubt on prospects for revenue. Investors started to flock to assets seen as safe as stocks plunged. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell as much as 12 basis points to 4.50%, the lowest level in over a month, while haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc surged.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) fell 0.9%, or about 380 points, on the heels of a winning week for the major gauges. Markets have been rattled by claims by China's DeepSeek that its AI assistant uses cheaper chips and less data than leading models, but performs equally well. A surge in DeepSeek's popularity has spurred a scramble by investors to reassess bets that AI demand-driven growth will keep fueling gains for stocks. AI bellwether Nvidia's shares tumbled over 11% in pre-market trading, as chip-related names took a bruising. ASML lost 9%, while Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron Technology (MU) also got hammered. Shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) both slid about 6% amid worries about megacaps' hefty investment in AI. Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN) also lost ground as techs sold off across the board.

Title: DeepSeek sell-off reminds investors of the biggest earnings story holding up the stock market

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not only what's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about Big Tech earnings. New developments from Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other Big Tech names prompted a pause in the US AI trade. Nvidia stock dropped more than 16%. Meanwhile, fellow "Magnificent Seven" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) were all off 2% or more. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, fell over 17%. "When expectations are high, one skeptical headline can knock the market off its axis," Ritholtz Wealth Management chief markets strategist Callie Cox wrote in a note on Monday. "That’s exactly what we’re seeing today." A slowdown in Big Tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With index valuations near multi-decade highs and the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice. "You have so much concentration in one area of the market — this has been the AI dominant themed market — and all of a sudden you bring in some uncertainty to that market, the initial reaction is to sell first and ask questions later," Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance. Unlike other risks like higher interest rates or sticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, DeepSeek's new AI model appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through. "The biggest risks are the ones that we're not talking about," Lerner said. "And everyone thinks it's tariffs and China. And, you know, really, what we're finding out is [DeepSeek] wasn't on anyone's bingo card." In 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead, causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, Big Tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis. The "Magnificent Seven" stocks are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. The year-over-year growth rate for the "Magnificent Seven" is expected to slow in the first quarter before accelerating once more to year-over-year earnings growth of more than 24% in the third quarter. Lerner reasoned that Monday's sell-off brought investors "back to fundamentals." "Washington matters, but there's other factors, in totality, that will likely matter more," Lerner said. "Tech is at the forefront of the overall return for the market this year." Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on X @_joshschafer.

Title: The Nasdaq sinks more than 800 points as a China AI threat sparks a huge tech stock sell-off

Full Content:
The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 3% Monday afternoon as a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia (NVDA), went up 109 points or 0.2% as of Monday afternoon. Moreover, the S&P 500 tumbled by 1.8%. The Nasdaq, which has been significantly boosted by AI hype, is especially susceptible to any investor concerns, especially when it comes to AI. And the rise of any competitor to U.S. dominance in the space, especially one that uses less energy and has less of a need for high-end chips, can cause fears to spike. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company said it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL) App Store over the weekend. Most notably, DeepSeek built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. Read more: Nvidia stock plunges 14% as a big advance by China’s DeepSeek rattles AI investors Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” The sell-off was led by Nvidia, whose stock fell as much as 16% Monday afternoon. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML), Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Micron (MU), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). “U.S. tech companies are trading at premium valuations, with major AI players like Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) commanding forward [price-to-earnings] multiples far above historical averages,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at investment platform Saxo, in a statement. “With these stocks priced for perfection, even minor disruptions, such as DeepSeek proving advanced AI can be built without top-tier chips, could weigh heavily on share prices.” Analysts at Wedbush said DeepSeek is not yet a real threat to U.S. hyperscalers, and could prompt further capital expenditure from major firms like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet, and Microsoft. This week, significant earnings reports are due from big tech companies, such as Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT).

DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company said it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL) App Store over the weekend.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock plunged 16% Monday afternoon after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek’s latest model raised questions about American competitiveness in the AI space. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Fundamental Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stands against other best fundamental stocks to buy now. The S&P 500 index closed 0.3% lower at 6,101.24 on Friday, January 24, reversing its course after hitting a fresh intraday record earlier in the session. The Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also slipped, with the former dropping 0.5% to 19,954.30 and the latter falling 140.82 points to 44,424.25. This marked the end of a four-day winning streak for the three major indexes. The decline was largely attributed to investors taking profits, particularly in mega-cap tech stocks. Despite this, the market remains bullish, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting their second consecutive positive week, rising 1.7% and 1.7% respectively. The Dow climbed 2.2% over the same period. In other news, President Trump made headlines on Thursday by calling for interest rates to drop immediately and asking Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations to lower the price of oil. Market participants are closely watching the President’s statements, which have had a significant impact on the market. However, the market’s optimism is largely driven by President Donald Trump’s pro-business policies, which have boosted risk assets. Investors are also relieved that the President has only made threats on the tariff front, rather than taking formal action, during his first few days in office.

In an interview with CNBC on January 23, Mike Bailey, Director of Research at FBB Capital Partners, discussed the current state of the market. He noted that companies have had a great quarter, which reflects the fact that the economy is doing well, people have jobs, and they’re buying things, which trickles down to the market. This, in turn, has a positive impact on the tech sector as a whole. However, Bailey advised investors to take a more nuanced approach and consider the specific fundamentals of each company. Bailey believes that large-cap companies have the greatest opportunity to meet or exceed investor expectations for growth. He noted that while small caps are trading cheaper, they may not be the best option for long-term investments or high-conviction plays. Bailey explained that his firm’s approach is focused on identifying companies with strong earnings growth potential, and larger cap companies tend to have more resources and a stronger track record of delivering on their growth promises. However, he did acknowledge that small caps can be a good option for investors who are looking to capitalize on a short-term economic cycle or recovery. Bailey emphasized the importance of looking beyond the top ten stocks that make up 50% of the market, which often dominate the conversation. He suggested that there are plenty of other companies that are worth considering. These companies, according to Bailey, offer a compelling combination of growth potential, valuation, and dividend yield, making them attractive options for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Furthermore, Bailey emphasized the importance of having a long-term perspective and not getting caught up in short-term market fluctuations. He encouraged investors to focus on the underlying fundamentals of each company and to avoid making emotional decisions based on market volatility. Large-cap companies with stable revenue and consistent net income growth remain attractive options for investors seeking reliable returns and long-term stability.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts. The new regulatory environment has the technology sector eyeing prominent growth opportunities in 2025 and beyond. Big Tech is set to release earnings next week and investors are excited to see how the group performed in the last quarter. On January 24, Dan Ives, managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, appeared in an interview on Morning Brief at Yahoo Finance to share his 2025 outlook for the tech sector. Ives suggested that the Street is underestimating the potential of Big Tech and advises investors to “grab popcorn” for the earnings week ahead. He also shared his optimism towards the billion-dollar investments made by the group before 2025 and claimed that the “fourth industrial revolution” has just begun. He also suggested that AI spending by companies heavily depends on the use cases for the company, and emphasized the unique selling point for each of the names in mega-cap tech names. Ives stated that the ability to monetize stall bases has been the crucial factor driving the growth among tech names, which happens to mimic what the hyperscalers have done. Ives emphasized that investments in artificial intelligence are now going to play out on the consumer side and remained confident that Big Tech is a step ahead in terms of the AI journey to monetization. He believes that seeing the return on investment play out, the Street is underestimating the growth in the tech sector, not just for the earnings next week but for 2025 as a whole. He also suggested that the regulatory environment is drastically changing especially in favor of the autonomous vehicles market and expects a massive year ahead for the segment and stocks associated with self-driving technologies and autonomous vehicle driving. The year ahead looks super solid for companies in the growth sector, namely artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, biotechnology, fintech, and software. While most of it is because of the efforts made by these names over the past year, the promising regulatory environment is going to boost the position of these stocks significantly.

(NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor and IT company that produces accelerators capable of managing complex AI workloads. Over the past few months, AMD launched advanced processors for the next generation of PCs and high-performing computing solutions for the AI computing demand. For instance, on January 6, AMD announced the launch of its first commercial Dell PCs that run on its AI processors. The new processors offer improved efficiency, privacy, personalization, and connectivity coupled with cutting-edge AI compute and advanced business productivity tools. On January 22, Thomas O’Malley, an analyst at Barclays shared his stance on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The analyst highlighted that the stock has been struggling for the past year. However, O’Malley believes that AMD’s investments in AI will allow the company to achieve year-over-year growth of a few billion dollars for MI series accelerators in 2025. He also added that the company will have to wait a little longer to garner opportunities for additional market share. Despite that, the analyst gives an overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $140, adding that the stock may potentially gain 12% in the coming months. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) attributes its growth to its data center products and ever-growing demand for its Ryzen PC processors. The company is emerging in the AI and technology sector as a leader in the production of accelerators and processors. Overall, AMD ranks 4th on our list of most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We recently published a list of 12 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts. The new regulatory environment has the technology sector eyeing prominent growth opportunities in 2025 and beyond. Big Tech is set to release earnings next week and investors are excited to see how the group performed in the last quarter. On January 24, Dan Ives, managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, appeared in an interview on Morning Brief at Yahoo Finance to share his 2025 outlook for the tech sector. Ives suggested that the Street is underestimating the potential of Big Tech and advises investors to “grab popcorn” for the earnings week ahead. He also shared his optimism towards the billion-dollar investments made by the group before 2025 and claimed that the “fourth industrial revolution” has just begun. He also suggested that AI spending by companies heavily depends on the use cases for the company, and emphasized the unique selling point for each of the names in mega-cap tech names. Ives stated that the ability to monetize stall bases has been the crucial factor driving the growth among tech names, which happens to mimic what the hyperscalers have done.

Title: Trump’s RTO edict raises concerns over morale, efficiency — and burnout
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3808863/trumps-rto-edict-raises-concerns-over-morale-efficiency-and-burnout.html
Time Published: 2025-01-27T11:00:00Z

President Donald J. Trump’s executive order to federal employees to return to the office “as soon as practicable” will have a variety of repercussions — most of them negative, according to industry analysts and others. The return-to-office (RTO) policy issued last week signals Trump’s intent to fulfill campaign promises to reform the 2.3-million-strong federal workforce, which he has criticized as inefficient and bloated. The language in Trump’s order doesn’t clarify whether it applies only to the estimated 10% of federal civilian workers — about 228,000 as of May 2024 — who work remotely full-time, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Trump may be upping the stakes, but then-President Joseph R. Biden Jr. signed legislation Jan. 5 designed to bring more federal employees back to the office and increase the efficiency of office space utilization. Both men were likely taking cues from various businesses that have instituted RTO mandates in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2022, Tesla and SpaceX chief executive CEO Elon Musk — now a close advisor to Trump — delivered an RTO ultimatum to his two companies’ white-collar workers: get back in the corporate office or face firing. Musk’s letter to executive staff at the time specified: “The office must be where your actual colleagues are located, not some remote pseudo-office. If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned.” Other corporations have followed suit more recently. In December, Amazon and AT&T ended their work-from-home policies. AT&T went so far as to tell 9,000 of its 149,000 workers to relocate to an office area or be fired. Peter Miscovich, managing director at global real estate firm JLL, said the US is entering a “hybrid winter,” as many CEOs impose RTO mandates that could pose talent attraction and retention challenges for leading IT organizations. That’s especially true for advanced tech leadership teams and IT departments that have built sophisticated hybrid work practices over time and invested significantly in hybrid operational technologies and related infrastructure across global organizations, he said. “Perhaps the most significant risk associated with RTO mandates is the potential loss of valuable and critical IT digital talent,” Miscovich said. “The IT tech sector has embraced hybrid work more thoroughly than most industries, and IT professionals now view hybrid workplace flexibility as a standard expectation for the workforce rather than a perk.” Over the past two or so years, remote work — once praised as the new paradigm for productivity and employee satisfaction — began losing some of its luster as more organizations required workers to get back to their cubicles, at least part time. In fact, many organizations are already struggling to fill a significant IT talent gap. In some cases, generative artificial intelligence (genAI) has been able to replace needed workers; in most other instances, the dearth of tech talent remains. According to new research from the University of Pittsburgh, S&P 500 companies that rolled out RTO mandates experienced “abnormally high” employee turnover and longer time-to-hire when filling job vacancies. “This significant IT digital talent brain-drain risk is particularly acute given the current competitive market for technology talent,” Miscovich said. In 2025, CIOs and senior IT leaders face growing challenges when trying to attract top talent while maintaining operational excellence and managing workplace transformation amid RTO mandates, according to Miscovich. Resistance to the mandates is especially strong in global IT departments where hybrid and remote work are deeply integrated and have proven highly effective. John Veitch, dean of the School of Business and Management at Notre Dame de Namur in Belmont, California, said RTO mandates are “generally” a sign of insecure leadership. In other words, executives don’t trust what they can’t see. RTO mandates say, “I have to see people working and earning their living,” he said. Veitch didn’t have strong feelings either way about RTOs involving the federal government workers, though from a workflow point of view, he said he’s not convinced there are benefits. He agreed that with the tech marketplace unemployment rate near historic lows, it could push some workers out the door, he said. “I don’t think the federal government pays particularly well relative to what you can get if you’re a top-flight technologist at a Silicon Valley firm,” Veitch said. “Obviously, people who have options will choose those options, particularly if return-to-office is a deal breaker for them. So, I don’t think it’s going to help the government in any way, shape or form to retain talented people.” Further research points to other problems with RTO mandates. Being in the office five days a week leads to higher rates of burnout, lower morale, and inefficiencies associated with commuting time, according to J. P. Gownder, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. On average, US workers spend 2.3 days in the office each week, according to a Stanford University study. A separate Stanford study found that hybrid work had zero effect on workers’ productivity or career advancement and dramatically boosted retention rates. In general, hybrid working arrangements hold numerous advantages over full-time, in-office, Gownder said, and for non-collaborative work, home offices are far better suited because they create “a focused environment.” “Despite some managers’ concerns, employees who work in hybrid fashion are more productive than those who spend all their time in the office. Most employees engage in a mix of personal and collaborative work,” he said. In fact, hybrid work boosts employee productivity, performance, and retention, according to Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford. Because of RTO mandates, employees are often forced to commute in only to do tasks they could handle at home. Even in the office, many still rely on videoconferencing to collaborate with colleagues in other locations. As a result of that and other inconveniences, organizations that move from hybrid work to full-time in-office work can expect higher attrition rates, Gownder argued. “Sometimes, managers impose these policies specifically to drive higher attrition, in lieu of layoffs,” he said. “IT talent often can work effectively remotely, and attrition rates in general are higher among IT professionals.” Additionally, the federal government and private companies have a dramatically smaller number of offices to which they could return as many companies have consolidated their footprints to a few key hubs. AT&T, for example, ordered 60,000 managers to work from one of only nine offices, forcing 9,000 employees to relocate or resign. As the pandemic eased in 2022 and 2023, US core business centers in large and small cities continued to suffer the after-effects of remote- and hybrid-work policies, which led to a 20% to 40% reduction in office space use and a devaluation of properties. The big switch to remote work left many downtowns largely empty for months. Data indicates that approximately 80% of offices had downsized by the end of 2023. Other sources indicate the downsizing slowed last year and by Q4 2024 office leasing rates were at about 92% of pre-pandemic levels, according to David Brodeur-Johnson, employee experience research lead at Forrester Research. “And yes, I believe that firms would be willing to expand their office spaces as needed to keep up with capacity, but most aren’t there yet,” he said. While most organizations adopted a hybrid-work policies, requiring employees to be in the office a few days each week while allowing work from home on other days, the Trump Administration’s policies are a strict, five-day RTO. That’s likely to incur an employee backlash, Brodeur-Johnson said. The federal government, he said, risks employee disengagement more than attrition. Monitoring federal employee surveys like FedRamp will be crucial, as disengagement is costly for both employees and employers. “It’s important to bear in mind also that autonomy is a primary source of intrinsic motivation — the kind that comes from within — so I would argue strongly that the biggest negative impact will likely be to employee engagement instead of attrition,” Brodeur-Johnson said. Academic studies also show that strong social relationships are key to remote work success, with emotional closeness outweighing physical distance. But simply being in the office doesn’t promote social relationships, Brodeur-Johnson pointed out. “Which is why companies like Nvidia have left it up to employees to decide, up to and including fully remote work,” he said. “How close people feel to each other emotionally is far more important than physical distance.” While Trump’s executive order could spark a wider look at RTO edicts elsewhere, most private companies have settled on what their employees will tolerate. Meanwhile, federal agencies have steadily increased in-office requirements, so the latest change shouldn’t be a surprise, Brodeur-Johnson said. But for some workers — especially those with care-giving duties or better flexible job options — it could be the tipping point. Top talent might leave first, which is why RTO mandates have slowed recently, he said. Senior Reporter Lucas Mearian covers AI in the enterprise, Future of Work issues, healthcare IT and FinTech.

Title: Playing To Win: The Pros And Cons Of Workplace Competition

Workplace competition has pros and cons. Workplace competition is inevitable in a corporate environment with an inherent pressure to outperform peers. Whether vying for promotions or bonuses, employees are in a constant race to climb the corporate ladder. Many organizations foster a competitive spirit in the hopes of driving productivity and innovation. When encouraged in the proper way, workplace competition can be beneficial. Yet, that same tactic can backfire if unhealthy rivalries result in a negative or hostile work environment. Competition in the office is more widespread than most people think. In a survey by ResumeLab, over 80% of respondents admit to experiencing workplace competition. While the majority (69.6%) describe the competition with co-workers as being healthy, just over 30% feel the competition is toxic. Co-workers who are considered healthy competition are referred to as “positive rivals.” The research revealed that employees with a positive rival are twice as likely than those with a negative rival to believe their organization creates an environment of healthy competition. Whether workplace competition results in a positive or negative experience depends on how leaders motivate employees. When competition makes employees feel excited, it can induce creative behaviors. On the other hand, if it causes workers to feel anxious and fearful, it could lead to unethical actions. Let’s review the pros and cons of workplace competition and how to create a balanced culture that generates positive outcomes. Fostering healthy workplace competition can boost employee engagement. For example, creating fun contests can help keep workers motivated. When your team feels inspired, they will work harder and be more productive. Competition also encourages people to learn new skills and go outside the scope of their roles. They feel challenged, which often contributes to greater performance. When that happens, it’s also easier for managers to identify individuals who display the leadership and initiative to be considered for promotions. Encouraging a competitive environment at work can drive creativity and team innovation. When the pressure to outperform peers builds, workers are motivated to think outside the box and strive for excellence. In a competitive workplace, the desire to innovate is constant. As a result, pursuing fresh ideas often leads to breakthroughs that might not occur in a strictly collaborative setting. Companies like Google, Amazon and Tesla are examples of organizations where workplace competition has been known to drive transformation and increase efficiency. When managed properly, workplace competition can generate higher-quality work output. The competitive environment helps guide employees to drive toward a goal. Their desire to outperform co-workers increases their focus and motivates them to pursue excellence. As teams put in more effort to impress their managers, work quality increases. If workplace competition is focused on negative outcomes, like the threat of layoffs or being publicly humiliated, it can create a toxic environment. Depending on the individual, the stress and anxiety associated with excessive competition can also breed hostility and negatively impact mental health. Finally, intense competitiveness can erode team unity as employees focus more on individual success than what will benefit the organization as a whole. When competitiveness at work results in a distrustful environment, collaboration is discouraged. Another downside is that some team members might perceive the competition as unfair, which can bring about conflicts. New employees, in particular, may feel discouraged if they think the expectations are unreasonable. When team members distrust leadership, it can result in disengagement over time. Depending on the individual, a highly competitive work environment can cause some people to act dishonestly. For example, if a sales executive is feeling the pressure to reach virtually impossible targets, they might sabotage a colleague’s work or manipulate data. When workplace competition becomes too intense, employees might even take credit for other people’s work to achieve a better performance review. Ultimately, these negative behaviors damage the company’s long-term reputation and team morale. Workplace competition can be a double-edged sword. While it sometimes motivates employees, it can also have the opposite effect. According to a study published in Harvard Business Review, the determining factor is how employees respond emotionally. If they interpret their feelings as anxiety, they are more likely to behave unethically. Yet, when they feel excited, they are apt to leverage creative behaviors to problem-solve. Fundamentally, how workplace competition makes people feel plays a crucial role in how they try to succeed. By leading with a positive attitude, managers can maintain a competitive spirit that makes employees feel nurtured and valued.

Title: Is Netflix (NFLX) the Best Stock to Buy for High Returns in 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy for High Returns in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025. On December 17, 2024, J.P. Morgan released its market outlook 2025. The report expects the global economy to continue growing at a robust rate, however a sharp slowdown in China is expected. Regarding the equity market, the firm anticipates depressing trends across stocks, sectors, and themes. Analysts at the firm estimate the S&P 500 to be around 6,500 in 2025 with earnings per share of $270. The head of Global Market Research, Hussain Malik noted that the policies of the United States regarding trade, immigration, and regulatory policy will play a critical role in defining the year’s outcome for the country and globally. The report further elaborated on its anticipation of a depressed stock market by highlighting de-coupling central bank policies, uneven progress in disinflation, and ongoing technological innovation. Moreover, increased geopolitical tensions are also likely to add unusual complexity to the global stock market. Despite all this, the firm has bright expectations for the United States. It believes that the country will remain a key driver of growth due to factors such as an expanding business cycle, a robust labor market, increased capital spending related to AI, and active capital markets. On the other hand, Europe is expected to grapple with structural challenges, while emerging markets may face headwinds from persistent high interest rates, a strong US dollar, and trade policy issues. Lakos-Bujas, head of Global Markets Strategy at J.P. Morgan warned that a key risk to their base case involves disinflation stalling or reversing, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate hikes later in 2025 or early 2026. Such developments would necessitate a reassessment of their market outlook. To curate the list of the 10 best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025, we used Insider Monkey’s third-quarter hedge funds database. We checked the 25 most widely held stocks by hedge funds for 10-year growth rates from Seeking Alpha and ranked these stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together. 10-Year Revenue Growth: 21.88% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 121 Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) runs an online streaming platform where users can watch movies, and TV shows, play games, and avail of other streaming services. The company has been gaining subscribers due to engaging content on its platform. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) executed its commitment to accelerating growth. It grew its revenue by 16% year-over-year while expanding its profit margins by six points to 27%. Management noted that it added 19 million net additions to its subscribers, which is the biggest net additions during a quarter in its history. On January 24, Laurent Yoon, an analyst at Bernstein, upgraded the stock to Outperform from Market Perform. The analyst also raised the price target from $975 to $1,200 stating that the firm believes Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) can post another year of double-digit growth in 2025. The analyst believes that there are still many international markets that remain underpenetrated by the company. Management has also raised its revenue expectation by $500 million for 2025 indicating they can generate more revenue from its memberships. It is one of the best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025. Montaka Global Investments stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “There are multiple structural trends in the enterprise software space, including (i) the ongoing cloud migrations and digital transformations of enterprises, and (ii) the infusion of AI into software applications. Overall, NFLX ranks 7th on our list of best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025.

Title: Top 5 Sectors To Invest In 2025

These five sectors offer substantial opportunities for investors looking to align with innovation ... [+] and market demand. The investment landscape in 2025 offers several promising opportunities in high-growth sectors. While market volatility continues to be a challenge, certain areas stand out for their strong growth potential, technological innovation, and ability to address critical global issues. This analysis, supported by comprehensive market research and economic indicators, highlights five sectors worth investors' attention. Successful investing in specific sectors requires analyzing several factors that indicate sustainable growth potential. These criteria are essential for making informed investment decisions based on solid fundamentals rather than market sentiment. Market trends involve both cyclical patterns and long-term changes in the economy. Key factors include trading volumes, price movements and sector rotation patterns. Economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates are vital in understanding market movements. For instance, the U.S. economy grew by 2.1% in 2024, but inflation rates stabilized around 3.4%, affecting sectors differently. Shifts in global trade dynamics, such as increased trade agreements in Asia and the continued impact of supply chain disruptions, are shaping investment opportunities. Innovation remains a critical driver of growth. Metrics such as R&D spending, patent applications, and the pace of new product development highlight sectors leading in technological advancements. According to recent reports, global R&D spending reached $2.5 trillion in 2024, with industries like artificial intelligence and clean energy receiving a significant share of this investment. Companies that innovate consistently are better positioned for sustained growth and market leadership. Analyzing global demand patterns helps identify growth trajectories. Demographic trends, such as aging populations in developed markets and growing middle classes in emerging markets, shape consumption patterns. For example, India’s GDP growth is projected to exceed 6.3% in 2025, driven by increased domestic consumption and infrastructure spending. These factors create opportunities for sectors like healthcare, advanced manufacturing and clean energy. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations are now central to evaluating sector performance. Sectors aligned with sustainability goals often benefit from supportive regulations and growing consumer demand for responsible business practices. In 2024, global ESG-focused assets under management surpassed $40 trillion, demonstrating the increasing investor focus on sustainability metrics such as carbon footprints, resource efficiency and governance standards. The sectors identified here were selected using a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics. Financial indicators such as revenue growth, profit margins and return on invested capital (ROIC) were paired with assessments of market positioning, competitive dynamics and regulatory environments. As we head into 2025, identifying the right sectors to invest in is more important than ever. With shifting economic trends, emerging technologies and evolving consumer habits, certain industries are positioned to outperform others. In this section, we’ll explore five sectors that offer strong potential for growth and resilience in the year ahead, backed by market trends and data-driven insights. Whether you’re looking for stability or high-growth opportunities, these sectors deserve a closer look The Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) sector is growing rapidly, with applications spreading across healthcare, finance and logistics industries. Major players are consolidating their market positions through acquisitions of innovative startups. AI adoption is accelerating, supported by technological advancements and increased investment. According to PwC, AI-driven technologies will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Regulatory frameworks are also evolving to ensure ethical AI usage, further boosting the sector's credibility. Clean energy has transitioned from an alternative option to a mainstream necessity. Advancements in battery technology and storage solutions have addressed previous challenges in adopting renewable energy. Governments worldwide are committing to net-zero emissions targets. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 continues to funnel billions into clean energy projects, and declining costs of renewable installations make this sector highly attractive. The healthcare technology sector encompasses digital health platforms, advanced diagnostics, and personalized medicine. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital health solutions while biotechnology continues to innovate. An aging population and rising healthcare costs are driving demand for innovative solutions. According to the WHO, global healthcare spending reached $10.3 trillion in 2024, highlighting the importance of this sector. As cyber threats grow in complexity, the cybersecurity sector is evolving rapidly. Comprehensive security platforms now incorporate AI-driven tools, zero-trust architectures and cloud-native solutions. Regulatory requirements, such as GDPR in Europe and increased focus on data privacy in the U.S., drive demand for robust cybersecurity solutions. Gartner predicts that worldwide spending on cybersecurity will exceed $200 billion by 2025. Technologies like industrial robotics, 3-D printing, and smart factories are revolutionizing traditional manufacturing processes. Supply chain disruptions in recent years have accelerated the adoption of automated solutions. Rising labor costs and the need for supply chain resilience have made automation a priority. According to McKinsey, automation could add $1.2 trillion to the global economy by 2030. These five sectors offer substantial opportunities for investors looking to align with innovation and market demand. While the potential for high returns exists, diversification and risk management are critical to navigating market volatility. Before investing, assess company fundamentals, valuation metrics, and broader economic conditions. Staying informed and monitoring trends within these sectors will be key to long-term success in 2025.

Title: Analysis of 76,882 Product Hunt Products, from 2014 – 2021
URL: https://components.one/posts/gamer-and-nihilist-product-hunt
Time Published: 2025-01-26T14:59:26Z
Full Content:
June 6, 2022 This report is the result of an analysis of Product Hunt from 2014 to 2021, including 76,822 products and 397,067 user profiles. Among its findings is that users who promote productivity apps and users who promote games are the least likely to be the same people, among any pair of categories. We argue that this opposition is a reflection of two nearly irreconcilable value systems. The first system, belonging to the person we have dubbed the nihilist, views productivity app usage as a means to reduce wasted time, but ironically turns this usage into an end in itself. This results in the appearance of productivity, but the actual production of relatively little. The second system, belonging to the person we’ve dubbed the gamer, situates the fun of gaming as an end in itself, which disincentivizes them from activities that eat into time spent having fun, such as faux productive behavior. The gamer equates waste itself to value, and can clearly separate utilitarian from non-utilitarian activity. The nihilist, on the other hand, is unable to explicitly value waste, and thus wastes time in a meaningless way. These opposing systems animate the types of organizations that cater to each persona: the perennially unprofitable venture-backed startup, for which faux productivity is connected to the generally immaterial nature of its high valuations, versus the game studio that lives and dies by the profitability of its products. The irreconcilability of the nihilist's and gamer's understandings of value is made manifest when the former's framework commandeers the latter's, resulting in compromised games (as in the case of Microsoft), or the appropriation of games into work and financial speculation (e.g., play-to-earn crypto games and the tokenized metaverse more generally). The earliest work on this project began in 2020, and the bulk of it took place in late 2021 and early 2022, during a continued period of euphoric valuations of both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies. As we finalized this project, both nosedived from their pandemic peaks after inflation concerns forced central banks around the world to raise interest rates. We hope this report provides worthwhile material to consider for creating organizations that require more than low interest rates to thrive, and to reflect on the meaning of value itself. The Product Hunt homepage. A Product Hunt product page. Product Hunt, the internet's largest social network and clearinghouse for apps, launched in 2013 when founder Ryan Hoover decided to build a central location to replace the word-of-mouth process his peers used to promote tech products they liked or had built. The result was something of a twist on Reddit, but for software, relying on three types of users to function. There are the Makers, who build and release products on the site; the Hunters, who sponsor a product by promoting it to their followers (each product can only have one Hunter); and the audience, which upvotes and comments on individual products. Within three years, Product Hunt had become so vital to product launches — Zapier, Notion and Slack are just three of the companies once publicized there that went on to multi-billion dollar valuations — that it was acquired by AngelList for $20 million. Today, Product Hunt remains a key scouting location for venture capital firms looking for new investments; the site is "a must-read website in the VC world,” according to one firm partner, and a place where "venture capitalists flock to…as a sourcing mechanism", as another put it. The interest of VCs in Product Hunt is well justified, as one analysis found that "an investment strategy based on Product Hunt votes would have outperformed the majority of funds out there." As Product Hunt flourished under AngelList, Hoover embarked on the obvious career pivot by becoming a VC. In 2017, he founded the Weekend Fund. Four years later, Product Hunt itself spun off Hyper, an accelerator fund. Earlier this year, both Product Hunt and Hyper were packaged together into a single holding company called Prologue, which was given $23 million in funding from goliath venture firms Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. Product Hunt's outsized role in the startup economy makes it a rich, semi-structured proxy for analyzing the broader paradigm of Silicon Valley — as a mirror of where VC attention is directed, of the tastes and interests of aspirational product designers, and as a imprint of the undergirding mores internalized by tech's inhabitants. Summary: Reducing sets of product category tags to only the largest category tag for each product reveals that Hunters who promote games are the least likely to promote products related to productivity, and vice versa. Let's start by situating ourselves on the map. This is how many products appear in the data on a monthly basis, beginning in 2014 (Product Hunt’s first full year) and stopping at the end of 2021. Whether this represents the actual number of products released on Product Hunt throughout this period is difficult to determine. The products and user data that appears in this analysis is based solely on the Product Hunt sitemap, and anecdotal experience indicates that not every product gets indexed there. But given the general smoothness of the curve, and the overall number of the products here (more than 70,000), it's as large a sample as one is liable to get. The geographic data below is based on self-reported information on people's Twitter accounts, which many link to from their Product Hunt user profiles. In all, 158,329 profiles linked to Twitter accounts have usable country information (e.g., "US" and "United States" can be normalized using the Google Maps API, but "🌍" and "NY/SF/London" can't be), and 124,073 usable city information. Some results may surprise (the dominance of Ukraine and Russia among upvoted Makers and Hunters, for instance) and others may not (the disproportionate occurrence of Americans, and specifically San Franciscans). The higher global median for Makers versus Hunters is due to the fact votes are counted for each product's Maker for each unique country. As we discovered, the more Makers a product has, the more upvotes it receives. Every product profile on Product Hunt contains a set of category tags. Users can follow these topics and receive notifications when new products with those tags are released. (One tag, "Tech," was removed from our analysis because of its ubiquity early in Product Hunt's history.) Since our thesis rests on the interplay of these tags, let's start by looking at them broadly, at both the most common tags in their own right as well as the most common pairs of tags. (The y-axes of these proportions were min-max normalized for each category when calculating the slopes.) Looking at how these categories have grown since the beginning of our dataset gives a sharper view of how dominant the most popular tags became by the end of 2021. Aside from the platform-oriented categories, the overall most common categories also have grown the most as a proportion of total products, observed by calculating the slope of the proportions of products with a given category over the whole time period. "Productivity," "Marketing," "Developer Tools," "Artificial Intelligence," and "SaaS" are the biggest gainers. In 2021, the "Productivity" tag was included in 39 percent of all product listings. Calculating shrinkage is more difficult and less exact, since some categories temporarily spike (the fact that these spikes all seem to appear in the same place raises questions about Product Hunt itself and its standards for categorization, as does the sudden, precipitous drop in some of the categories in our growth chart). Obviously, most of these curves aren't linear. As a predictive exercise, using a linear model here would be forbidden, but as a merely descriptive exercise, it tells us what we need to know. Importantly, the results all map to basic reality. The diminishment of operating systems — "Windows," "Mac," and "Linux" — corresponds to software-as-a-service (SaaS) web apps solidifying their dominance as a delivery system for software over the studied period. The near disappearance of "Ridesharing" coincides with the dried up interest in building third-party apps for (or, more certainly, alternatives to) Uber and Lyft. "Custom iPhone Keyboards" are a category of product whose existence we had forgotten about until seeing their downfall here. And the occurrence of three game-related tags — "PS4," "Xbox One," and "Oculus Rift" — are meaningful not only for appearing together, but for signaling a broader disinterest in gaming on the platform over time. The "Games" category, while the 10th most popular tag overall, was 20th in 2021. And as we'll see shortly, games underperform nearly every other category on the site. To examine what types of products people on the platform generally like, it's more useful to look at which categories are most and least likely to be voted into the Product of the Day rankings (reaching the rankings was all that mattered, the order of the rank was ignored) rather than looking at upvotes, as those numbers fluctuate. The patterns among the top ranked products are relatively straightforward, and at the bottom, they are resounding. Games and their subcategories are the least likely to receive top recognition on the platform. Perhaps this is because Hunters are more likely to promote amazing spreadsheet-type apps and less likely to promote good games. Or maybe it has to do with the nature of the platform itself: it's easier to quickly grasp the intention and capabilities of a new prototyping tool than it is to fully evaluate The Witcher 3 (a game Hunted on the site). What follows in the rest of this report is an argument that neither of these arguments fully explains the broad rejection of games on Product Hunt. To that effect, let's examine one last graph. This graph shows which categories correlate among Hunters themselves. To examine this, every product's set of categories was reduced to only its largest category. For example, if a product's tags are “Games,” “Raspberry Pi,” and “Batteries,” and if “Games” appears more often in the entire dataset than the other two, that product's category tags will be reduced only to “Games.” Only Hunters with at least two and fewer than 50 hunted products were included, and only tags that occurred at least 20 times among them all were included. We then looked at the Spearman coefficient for every pair of categories. Negative values mean a Hunter who promotes X category is less likely to promote Y; positive values mean the opposite. The categories in the visualization, in addition to gaming, include every category for which gaming was the most negatively correlated category — i.e., those most likely to be hunted by people different than those hunting gaming products. There are some caveats to state outright, mainly that not every relationship in this graph is necessarily meaningful, or at least not obviously so. Many of these values fall into top-10 territory despite being quite small comparatively. Whether people who like games really are disproportionately interested in “Firefox Extensions,” or whether those drawn to “Productivity” really are Scrooge-like, aren't claims anyone should make by citing this graph. Nevertheless, many of these relationships are, prima facie, meaningful, including every pair in the list of most positive correlations. That the same person would be interested in both “Augmented Reality” and “Wearables,” or “Snapchat” and “Twitter,” needs no further explanation, because it maps to an apparent reality of how tastes relate to one another. Our argument is simply this: The opposition between “Productivity” and “Games” — that a Hunter who promotes games and a Hunter who promotes productivity tools is less likely to be the same person than for any other pair of interests on Product Hunt — not only maps to an apparent reality, but also to a broader critique of Silicon Valley and its framework of value, time, and experience. Let's now step away from the data and examine our two personas — one drawn to productivity apps, and the other to games. We'll call the first the nihilist, and the second the gamer. Summary: The nihilist is not everyone who uses productivity tools, but the person who sees these tools as ends in and of themselves, and for whom the disciplined use of such tools corresponds with the opposite of their stated purpose — i.e., the absence of producing much of anything at all. The world of the nihilist is a kluge of productivity apps that tumorously agglomerate Akira-like in both the nihilist’s organization and individual life. The nihilist’s goal is to project a hologram of value in order to deceive everyone, from peers to managers to investors to the nihilist themself, that something valuable is actually taking place. In 2018, Judy Wajcman, a professor of sociology at the London School of Economics, published a paper based on her interviews with electronic calendar designers in the Bay Area. Titled "How Silicon Valley sets time", the paper drew a continuum from Frederick Winslow Taylor's scientific management of the early 20th Century — in which Taylor pioneered the practice of timing employees performing tasks down to the second to more efficiently orchestrate their actions — to electronic calendars in the 21st, situating both as nodes in the development of capitalistic time optimization. The focus on productivity exists in service of developing other apps for productivity, a feedback loop in which the only thing being optimized is the means of optimization itself. From an academic perspective, all predictable enough so far. But what makes Wajcman's paper so useful are the details of this historical continuum, as well as the preoccupations and values expressed by her interviewees: "In response to my query about why they were working on calendar products, many of my interviewees immediately told me about their own, personal quest for efficient time management. They expressed pride in the way they optimize time, which was a crucial part of their self-presentation and linked to an optimal self. Indeed, their commitment to improving the functionality of calendars seemed, at least in part, driven by their own need for a better calendar.” It's important to state this explicitly: The explosion of productivity apps on Product Hunt cannot be separated from the personal interests and self-identities of their designers, whose own focus on productivity exists in service of developing other apps for productivity, a feedback loop in which the only thing being optimized is the means of optimization itself. Wajcman pinpoints the introduction of an application called Agenda in 1988 as a key node in the development of electronic time management. "The aim…was to develop a ‘Personal Information Manager’," she writes. “It was a new generation of software, developed in line with the dream, as old as computing itself, that computers could be used to master tides of information. Indeed, it came to be described as a ‘spreadsheet for words’....to build a comprehensive ‘interpersonal information manager’ that would end the silos between emails/tasks/appointments/notes/addresses, but also between music/photos/blogs…and make this all secure and shared.” (Emphasis added.) Those who have paid even passing attention to modern productivity software will recognize the language and aim of Agenda, a project from more than 30 years ago, and therefore the broad endeavor of saving time, breaking silos, and endlessly iterating on what essentially amounts to the same few products, over and over, decade after decade. In fact, one sees all of these features emerge when examining the words that define the "Productivity" tag in Product Hunt. Looking at the terms that are more likely to occur in listings for "Productivity" products than any other type, we can see what productivity broadly signifies: The minimization of wasted time, and the optimization of other tools. Of course, this expanding superabundance of productivity tools is accompanied by a handful of paradoxes. The first is that, as Wajcman observed of her interviewees, the job of dutifully organizing one's own calendar (and by extension, administering most kinds of software-based productivity regimens) "becomes a new task in itself, a form of skilled labour or competency that must be cultivated." Importantly, this task is not simply a minor adjunct to one's primary activities whose net gain is easily identifiable. Instead, "[a]s one of the designers I interviewed, who writes a blog advising people on how to hone their calendaring practice, told me (without irony), he actually spends quite a lot of time doing this work.” This irony operates on an organizational level as well. According to one survey, the average company now has over 200 app licenses, only 45% of which are ever used. The sheer quantity of apps available in the workplace proliferates to such a degree that they ultimately necessitate their own management team and become a source of confusion for actual employees, whose attention is splintered between three messaging apps, seven spreadsheet apps, and four project management apps. This cancerous spread inevitably becomes the rationale for the adoption of an umbrella app, which promises to unify and integrate the functions of all the other apps within a single piece of software, and which it almost always fails to do. Second, it's unclear whether making all these apps available to employees has measurably improved productivity on any macro level. On the contrary, the more convincing evidence is that measurable labor productivity hasn’t notably increased since 1970. The picture looks worse the closer you zoom in: Between 2010 and 2018, labor productivity grew by an annual rate of less than one percent, even as the development of these apps ascended to a yet unrealized zenith. Third, the amount of work whose purpose is nearly impossible to discern has reached an astronomical level. This landscape of meaningless labor formed the premise of David Graeber's landmark 2013 essay "On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs," in which he argued that "Huge swathes of people, in Europe and North America in particular, spend their entire working lives performing tasks they secretly believe do not really need to be performed. The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is profound. It is a scar across our collective soul. Yet virtually no one talks about it." The wide ranging response to Graeber's thesis (spanning everyone from those who took the highest umbrage to others who felt they were reading a line-by-line account of their own lives) included two surveys, one by the British polling agency YouGov, and the other by a Dutch firm. The results of the two surveys were strikingly similar: Of the employed, 37 percent of Brits believed their work made "no meaningful contribution to the world," and 40 percent of Netherlanders believed, even more pertinently to our current analysis, that their jobs had no reason to even exist — that they could not fathom how their employment aided their organization's production of anything. A startup displays its success by boasting about its headcount growth. Most startup managers would of course consider themselves exempt from such assessments; there's no data readily available indicating that employees within them are more or less useless than those at any other type of company. From collective anecdotal experience, startups are plagued by bullshit jobs at least at the same magnitude as any other category of firm, a reality borne out by the inevitable hiring spree undertaken by most startups after large funding rounds, and the emphasis on headcount as a meaningful measure of a company's success. Given all of this, the question is why, amidst a broader context of such glaring unproductivity, Silicon Valley's treatment of productivity has taken on what one of Wajcman's interviewees described as a nearly religious imperative, and why it has come to dominate the descriptions of products on the internet's most prominent clearinghouse of new software? Why is so much money (in investment capital for productivity apps, in individual and corporate licenses to use them) and personal time poured into an area whose ability to boost actual productivity is either negative or negligible? The answer formed Graeber’s thesis, and is obvious to anyone whose life doesn’t depend on not seeing it: actual productivity isn’t the objective. Instead, the objective is the feeling of busyness, regardless of whether that busyness is connected to the production of anything at all. This optimization of nothing beyond the sensation of working hard comes in different forms for different actors, but it sits at the nexus of Silicon Valley's conception of productivity. To the Veblenian Entrepreneur — a breed of aspirant startup founder for whom, according to the researchers who coined the concept, "entrepreneurship [is] an activity, defined by symbolic manipulation, tokenism and consumption" — using productivity apps is one in a number of cargo cult rituals practiced to secure an entrepreneurial identity. In fact, Product Hunt itself, which offers a subscription program for aspiring founders "to kickstart your startup," fits squarely within the researchers' characterization of the "Entrepreneurship Industry," a market of goods and services that caters to the Veblenian Entrepreneur and ultimately contributes to "an economy that outwardly appears dynamic and entrepreneurial, but is rife with inefficiencies and lacks substantive innovative capacity." For the middle manager, busy-work is usually done in service to some performance indicator whose relation to the core business and its ability to profit is ambiguous at best and more often simply nonexistent. In a Harvard Business Review article that recast middle managers as “connecting leaders,” the researcher Zahira Jaser wrote that their performance depended on practices like “empathizing with both sides” and “speaking up for others.” Put in simpler terms, the middle manager’s job is to fill up their chosen calendar and task management apps as much as possible. From the perspective of VCs, the ultimate objective is not productivity as dictated by conventional market logic (i.e., the minimization of costs and the maximization of profits on goods and services), but the shuffling of money between investors, facilitated through the aggregation of various narrative components — branding, headcount increases, a mythos of disruption — until the investment position has grown enough to be worth cashing out through acquisition or IPO. This understanding of the startup economy was lucidly framed in one of the most potent scenes from the series Silicon Valley, a show that tech mandarins routinely claim to enjoy but whose deep critiques they inevitably seem to reject. In a sector of the economy where "it's not about how much you earn, but about how much you're worth," the labors of the companies whose workflows are built on the kinds of productivity apps that today comprise nearly 40 percent of Product Hunt's output are not actually directed at the creation of a thing, but at the appearance of the creation of a thing. This detachment between productive-like behavior and actual productivity is why the runaway expansion of apps throughout organizations rarely prompts a reevaluation of their usage, but instead initiates the adoption of yet another super app to solve the problem. The company that conducted the survey mentioned above on the proliferation of SaaS apps was founded to capitalize on this overabundance: Its name is Productiv, it has raised $73 million, and it sells a "software-as-a-service management platform," a category one Gartner analyst called "a growing but early-stage market." Summary: Unlike the nihilist, whose strictures forbid the very idea of wasted time, the gamer centralizes waste (i.e., non-productive activity) as the essence of life's meaning, and therefore as the foundation of value. Accordingly, contrary to the nihilist (who destroys value in their attempt to reduce waste), the gamer is a value maximizer, for the simple reason that they want to minimize the time spent on productive activity and maximize the time spent playing games. This basic arithmetic leads to a straightforward result that avoids the nihilist’s Mobius strip of endlessly optimizing the optimizations, which as we’ve seen, leads to completely nonoptimal systems. The gamer sees ends as ends, and means as means. In The Accursed Share, George Bataille introduced "general economy," his theory of understanding economies as systems organized primarily for non-utilitarian goods. While day-to-day exchanges — getting your car serviced, buying widgets, etc. — may appear utilitarian up close, at a distance, the broader, general economy ultimately serves non-utilitarian ends. That's because the excess generated by this economic activity can't be reabsorbed for continued expansion — the mechanic can't further expand their shop, the widget maker can't increase their widget production, and so on, resulting in money that has no place to go. This excess is waste, the accursed share which Bataille defined as wealth, and is ultimately directed to unproductive expenditures, like "games, spectacles, arts, and perverse [non-reproductive] sexual activity" — as well as, in his ethnographic reading, war and human sacrifice. In short, the waste is directed towards those things which "have no end beyond themselves." From the true ending to Cruelty Squad. To Bataille, this waste isn't merely economic — it comprises our very cosmic order, as the sun radiates its waste energy and provides the earth with life. "Beyond our immediate ends, man's activity in fact pursues the useless and infinite fulfillment of the universe,” he wrote. To place waste — which "must be spent, willingly or not, gloriously or catastrophically” — at the center of economics is therefore required not only to accurately depict the function of economies, but of life's very meaning. The tension between utilitarian and non-utilitarian understandings of both economics and the universe found its way into Graeber's work as well, who specifically considered fun as one possible aim of life's useless fulfillment. After considering the types of theories proposed by rationalist evolutionary biologists who evaluate all behavior for their capacity to maximize survival, Graeber — drawing a line through the random movements of subatomic particles, the observed behavior of ants playing, and human predilection for fun — roughly proposed a different interpretation in the fashion of Bataille: Let us imagine a principle. Call it a…principle of ludic freedom. Let us imagine it to hold that the free exercise of an entity’s most complex powers or capacities will, under certain circumstances at least, tend to become an end in itself. It would obviously not be the only principle active in nature. Others pull other ways… [S]uch a perspective is at least as plausible as the weirdly inconsistent speculations that currently pass for orthodoxy, in which a mindless, robotic universe suddenly produces poets and philosophers out of nowhere. The Graebarian construction, then, gives us at least one polarity — fun at one end, bullshit at the other — similar to that which emerges in our data. On either end of this polarity, there is the person who centers experience (particularly the fun kind) as an end in and of itself, and there is the person who centers something else, like optimization for its own sake. And if the universe is calibrated precisely to generate seemingly useless experiences from its excesses, then the person who centers productivity has instead centered something meaningless. Nintendo's Reggie Fils-Aimé announcing the release of the Nintendo Switch in 2017. In this sense, the gamer does not only include those who play video games (nor does it necessarily include all those who do). The gamer is a synecdoche; skateboarders, people who seriously play sports, interested music listeners, cinephiles, chess players, big wave surfers, and anyone else who orients their lives towards experiences that contain fun as a major ingredient are all subsumed into the persona. Casually playing a game on a subway or after a busy day to unwind doesn't by itself garner the gamer moniker, while taking paid vacation time to spend a focused 100 hours on Elden Ring does. Since the gamer is able to properly identify waste versus productive behavior, these activities are never confused for one another, and they maintain their separation. In the world of the nihilist, this barrier collapses; waste and production have no distinction. Among the many ramifications of this collapse is that the nihilist spends their wasted time in the most un-fun ways possible, performing faux productive activity. The nihilist is unable to see activities as anything other than means to an end, evaluating all objects for their utility in lubricating some other activity — for example, the use of music solely for exercise, falling asleep, building productivity apps, and so on. Because of this, there is no end, only self-perpetuating means. For the gamer, these objects — music, film, games, etc. — form the basis of any cosmic argument, and experience constitutes the bedrock of their understanding of themselves in relation to everything else. The gamer properly identifies waste versus productive behavior, never confusing one for the other. For the nihilist, waste and production have no distinction, leading them to spend their wasted time in the most un-fun ways possible. Perhaps it's because of this very ability to distinguish genuinely productive activity from waste that the gamer's organizations tend to follow a saners business models, one in which companies live or die by what they make, not valuations based on speculative futures. We previously explored this dichotomy in our report March 23, 2021 The Chaos Bazaar An analysis of Bandcamp sales, 9/1/2020 - 12/31/2020 Bandcamp things on the business models of Bandcamp versus Spotify — the former (which centralizes music as an end in itself) profitable by facilitating straightforward exchanges between producer and consumer, the latter (which has advanced music as little more than a hormone-boosting adjunct to other activities) commanding a market cap of $69 billion at its peak in 2021 despite failing to earn a profit nearly every quarter. March 23, 2021 An analysis of Bandcamp sales, 9/1/2020 - 12/31/2020 The economy of game production has so far remained relatively untouched by venture capital and its valuation-over-value modus operandi. The main exceptions include free-to-play Skinner Box mobile games (which do not constitute experiences so much as anti-experiences) and a few high-profile companies such as Epic and Roblox, both of which attracted VC attention because they are seen by investors as stepping stones to something beyond merely a game. Roblox garnered investment because of its metaverse potential, and therefore its potential as a future monopoly. Epic has attracted $7 billion in investment for the same reason, along with Fortnite's popularity in eSports, a sector VCs have fewer qualms about investing in due to teams' abilities to be leveraged into apparel and content brands. (In fact, Epic only became seen as a company worth investing in upon Fortnite's release ― their output in the 16 years leading up to the game, in which they built and sold the widely used Unreal Engine and developed the mega successful Gears of War franchise, won them seemingly no solicitation from Silicon Valley whatsoever.) As an example of this sort of leveraging, consider 100 Thieves, an association of eSports teams that has received $120 million in funding from investors including Sequoia and Salesforce founder Marc Benioff. Just before the upswing of Covid, the company released a video tour of its new facility in Los Angeles, the Cash App Compound, including shots of players practicing in the building's Totino's Fortnite Training Room and streamers broadcasting from windowless cinderblock prison cells. In December 2021, the company announced a $60 million Series C round in a video laying out its ambition to build a "Marvel-esque universe" of content creators and its plans for apparel and merch drops. In line with the startup economy, it acknowledged its continued unprofitability in service of exponential growth to become "the most recognized brand in gaming." In the 14-minute video, less than two minutes were spent discussing the company's teams. At present, 100 Thieves' skeletal website functions purely as a direct-to-consumer clothing store; one must dig to find any mention of games at all. Meanwhile, while every new spreadsheet app will either receive venture funding or disappear from the face of the earth, independent game studios can profitably operate while avoiding venture investment entirely. Examples of established studios are legion, ranging from Hitman maker IO Interactive, which generated $78 million in profit last year, to Paradox, who, according to some napkin math, brought in more than $120 million with their latest release, Crusader Kings III. Indie game studios have also been able to successfully leverage crowdfunding in a way that would be totally alien to the makers of some cloud-based pomodoro timer. The three-person Australian studio Team Cherry got funding for its metroidvania masterwork Hollow Knight via Kickstarter and sold nearly three million copies two years after its 2017 launch. RimWorld, another crowdfunded game released in 2018, is estimated to have grossed over $100 million. (As seen in the earlier graph on Hunter category correlations, our data shows a relationship between affinities for crowdfunding and games. As we noted earlier, not every relationship that shows up is necessarily meaningful, but this one does correspond to a real phenomenon.) The saner business logic of the gaming industry is connected to a number of distinctions between the organizations of the gamer and the nihilist — notably that, unlike productivity apps whose licenses are usually ordered and paid for by someone completely different from the end user, a gamer is almost always both purchaser and user. The prospect of all but the most spendthrift gamer leaving 55 percent of their purchased libraries completely unplayed is unfathomable. This relates to arguably the most striking difference between their respective organizations: the game studio's greater accountability to its own hype. CD Projekt Red's response to the crisis of Cyberpunk 2077 — in which years of orchestrated anticipation was followed by the release of an 85-percent completed product that didn't function on two major consoles — led to frantic patching and the issuing of mass refunds. Co-founder Marcin Iwiński's apology, when placed next to any non-response of some equivalently dysfunctional AI startup, carried the desperation of an Al-Qaeda hostage video. Bethesda took a similar approach after the bug-ridden release of the also hyped Fallout 76. When players of No Man's Sky complained of an empty, barren universe, the developers overhauled the game to inject its world with new dynamism. While it is nearly impossible to objectively assess the value that most of Silicon Valley's productivity tools provide to their users, the gamer is able to evaluate goods on a basic, subjective benchmark, one that Blizzard acknowledged in its mea culpa to disappointed players of Warcraft III: Reforged: "We want to say we’re sorry to those of you who didn’t have the experience you wanted." Summary: Attempts by nihilists to govern the gamer's space results in palsied games, with Microsoft and its killing field of studios providing the largest example. The metaverse envisioned by Microsoft, Facebook, and crypto-oriented projects promises game-like systems that are ruled by productivity instead of fun, and functions as a proxy battle between the gamer and the nihilist. So far, gamers themselves have already reacted against these incursions by vehemently denouncing NFTs and forcing developers and marketplaces to exclude them. What happens when the nihilist encroaches onto the gamer's territory? Perhaps no other company has done so as successfully as Microsoft. In February, the company's CEO, Satya Nadella, justified his mandate to build the nebulous concept known as the metaverse by claiming, "Being great at game building gives us permission to build the next internet." It is true that Microsoft makes and distributes games, a lineage that runs from the original 1982 Flight Simulator to everything currently related to Xbox, including its pending $75 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. It is also true that the way it has handled its gaming division is precisely what one would expect from the creators of Windows. The YouTube game critic videogamedunkey's 2019 discussion of Microsoft's gaming operation provides a concise but thorough overview of the company's body count when it comes to not only the number but the type of failures it has amassed over the years, which ultimately rendered the Xbox One "the system to get because your friends have Xbox." Microsoft's acquisition of Rare, which in the 1990s created groundbreaking titles like Donkey Kong Country and Banjo Kazooie, ended with the studio "reduced to making shovelware Kinect games," a reference to the Xbox's motion-capture peripheral whose canyon-sized disparity between marketing and reality made it a case study in consumer tech hype. Beyond Rare, Microsoft's acquisition spree of other studios functioned as a Sports Illustrated cover curse, ending the hit-making heydays of each. As Dunkey surmised, "Either these guys just have the shittiest luck ever, or they're not willing to dig deep and spend the money to get stuff made right." On this last point, Dunkey is probably wrong. Bungie — the studio behind Halo that was acquired in 2000, when it was nearing completion of the game, in order to turn Halo into an Xbox launch title — left Microsoft in 2019. From there, Microsoft's own in-house studio ended up creating Halo Infinite at a cost of $500 million, making it the most expensive game ever created. (The result was a product basically similar to the other titles in the franchise.) And while not every game the company produces carries such a high price tag, there's not necessarily any sign that the studios it acquires are victims of slash-and-burn cost cutting. In fact, games that Microsoft published but didn't actually develop, like Ori and Cuphead, have still been able to achieve both commercial and critical success even with shoestring teams. Rather than miserliness, Nadella unwittingly pinpointed the problem himself as he made his case for why his company would be the first to build the metaverse. "[In] the Microsoft I grew up in, I always think about three things," he said. "The three things that we always had are: we built tools for people to write software; we built tools for people to drive their personal and organizational productivity; and we built games." Put another way, Microsoft's track record is the predictable result of combining an organizational culture whose cornerstone ethos is productivity-destroying software and bullshit work with their diametrically fun opposites. And Microsoft offers perhaps the best case scenario of such an equation, which for other tech companies has resulted in a total wash: as the Financial Times noted, "Early attempts by Google and Amazon to create games studios of their own have failed to make a dent." The company's relentless destruction of game studios aside, the threat to fun posed by a tokenized metaverse, crypto, NFTs, and everything else comprising the fatberg of web3 is, while procedurally different than the gutting of Rare et al., similar in effect. A still from a promotion for an NFT residence where a pool party is taking place. As far as our Product Hunt data is concerned, the relationships between Hunter tastes between productivity, crypto, and games is fairly inconclusive, with no definitive relationships either way. Observationally speaking, there was no shortage of CS:GO players who went long on Dogecoin during its manic peak. But gamers engaging in a standalone pump-and-dump scheme is categorically different from tokenizing a game itself. The arguments of crypto boosters for their incursion into gaming — which ultimately results in games as utilitarian financial operations rather than meaningful uselessness — relies on the same nihilistic opposition to the gamer's framing of time, and the same refusal to consciously embrace waste as value. This misalignment was articulated by Reddit cofounder and VC Alexis Ohanian, who claimed that, in 2027, "90% of people will not play a game unless they are being valued properly for that time," predicting that play-to-earn crypto games would soon displace every other form. Because the nihilist is unable to make good games, the output of their efforts so far have made Ohanian's prognosis as bleak as it is unlikely. ("Most of the people who are talking about metaverse have absolutely no idea what they're talking about," Valve president Gabe Newell told PC Gamer. "And they've apparently never played an MMO.") And so far, gamers' reception of crypto into their world has taken on the exact opposite form that Ohanian predicted. Instead, gamers' vehement backlash against NFTs has forced multiple companies to explicitly position themselves against the technology. Among them, Sega dropped its plans to include NFTs in future Sonic games. The indie game store Itch.io issued a condemnation. Valve outright banned NFTs on Steam, the world's largest marketplace for PC games. And even Epic promised it would not integrate them into Fortnite. One company that admitted it "under-evaluated how strong the backlash could have been" to its NFT rollout was Ubisoft, one of the most commercially successful game studios in the world as well as one of the most reviled. For Ubisoft, NFTs are merely the latest in a nihilistic transformation that has played out over time. In 2018, it released Assassin's Creed Odyssey, a third-person open world action/adventure game with a traditional leveling system based on experience points, which are earned in side quests. Ubisoft offered microtransactions in the game that allowed people to skip the quests entirely and purchase XP with real money "so that you don't have to actually play the game you just bought for $60," as Dunkey put it. The feature was called "Time Savers." Our argument isn't intended to create a rigid dualism between the gamer and the nihilist, but rather to point out an underappreciated dichotomy. Very few people fall neatly into one camp or the other; many would fall into neither. All sorts of issues arise when actually applying this framework that we won't try to reconcile, such as which heuristic best fits professional athletes, eSports players, Twitch streamers, musicians, and so on, all of whom can blur the line between utility and fun. Similarly, nothing contained in this report should be taken in absolutist terms. Not all productivity tools are vehicles of nothingness (many of them are quite useful), and not all the people who design and fund them are nihilists. What's important is the contemplation of the fun experience as opposed to faux productivity and bullshit work. While we were preparing this report, the tech economy (including crypto) was suddenly bludgeoned by reality, courtesy of rising interest rates that effectively neutralized the pandemic bubble. The era of easy money is now over, while the price of crypto has crashed along with the stock price of every perennially unprofitable company birthed in the post-2008 tech craze. This contraction will likely have consequences for venture funding and the ability of investors to exit companies via IPO or acquisition as the appetite for risk dries up. Somewhat overnight, the fund-everything, hire-everyone mania that pervaded has been replaced with the cold arithmetic of cash flow. As money and work ideally become re-oriented towards some vaguely rational idea of value, the opposition between the nihilist and the gamer is important to reflect on in service of injecting sanity, and even some shred of morality, into our markets. In his essay on fun, Graeber summed up Friedrich Schiller's own views on fun, that "it was precisely in play that we find the origins of self-consciousness, and hence freedom, and hence morality. 'Man plays only when he is in the full sense of the word a man…and he is only wholly a Man when he is playing.' If so,… then glimmers of freedom, or even of moral life, begin to appear everywhere around us." For Kant as well, an ability to separate means from ends represented a pillar of the ethical life. And Zeus deemed work without meaning a sentence to be doled out to those deserving of the most intolerable hell. There is no shortage of kind and good-hearted nihilists, and no shortage of black-hearted gamers. But the respective economies organized around each framework can’t help but tip the moral balance in one direction, however counterintuitive that morality may sometimes appear under RGB lights. As Wajcman said at the end of her paper, "Calendars will never ask us what we want to save time for." Neither will Jira, Monday.com, or any of the other apps built less to optimize than to be optimized. Games at least ask the question, and they can begin to help us form an answer.

Even though the year 2024 was not kind to certain sectors within the US economy, the broader outlook for the stock market heading into the new year was more than rosy. Investment banks generally anticipated moderate economic growth for the US in 2025. For example, Deutsche Bank forecasts a growth rate of approximately 2%, noting that 2025 will not be a year of rapid GDP growth. Meanwhile, JP Morgan's Global Investment Strategy team emphasized a foundation of strength stemming from 2024's robust market returns.

Top economic experts project that inflation rates will decelerate in 2025, approaching the Federal Reserve's 2% target by the second half of the year. This outlook suggests a stabilization of price levels, which could influence monetary policy decisions. US Bank Chief Economist Beth Ann Bovino offered insights into the Federal Reserve's anticipated actions. She predicted that the Fed would implement two interest rate cuts in 2025, citing continued economic strength. Bovino also noted that proposed tariffs and tax cuts by the new administration could exert additional inflationary pressures, potentially complicating the Fed's policy decisions. The fiscal policies of the new administration are expected to play a significant role in shaping the economic landscape. Bank of America analysts Claudio Irigoyen and Aditya Bhave discussed the interplay between US policy changes and the global economy. They anticipated that fiscal policy would be expansionary through tax cuts and acknowledged that proposed tariff increases could have a modest impact on consumer price inflation. Their analysis underscored the importance of balancing growth initiatives with inflation control. In terms of sector performance, Standard Chartered Bank expressed optimism about equities and commodities. Entering 2025, the bank was overweight in equities and gold, citing a resilient global economy with a projected GDP growth of 3%.
