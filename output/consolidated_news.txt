Ireland head coach Neil Doak has made two changes and a positional switch to the starting team that beat Scotland for Friday night’s Under-20 Six Nations Championship clash with Wales at Rodney Parade (7.45). Cork Constitution’s Eoghan Smyth returns to the side having started in the defeat against England before being sprung from the bench against Scotland. His robust defence and straight running were missed in Edinburgh. Smyth resumes his midfield partnership with one of Ireland’s outstanding players to date, Connor Fahy, who switches back to outside centre. Gene O’Leary Kareem reverts to the replacements. The other change is in the frontrow where Ballynahinch tighthead Tom McAllister gets a chance in the run-on team, swapping places with Blackrock’s Alex McMullan, another standout player, who is on the bench. The other alterations to the replacements see UCD hooker Mikey Yarr, who played last year, return after recovering from injury. Highfield’s Conor Kennelly comes in for a try scorer the last day, Shannon’s Oisín Minogue, while Tom Wood, a son of former Lions and Ireland hooker Keith, is included in the matchday 23 for the first time. Several Ireland players have received a vote of confidence from the coaching team despite lapses in individual, and indeed the collective, performances to date and will need to repay that faith with greater clarity, precision and execution on both sides of the ball. Ireland assistant coach Andrew Browne, who won a Grand Slam at this age-grade as a player in 2007, admitted that the group had spoken about being sharper mentally and physically. “In the England game we had a lot of possession, a lot of 22 entries, [that] we just didn’t convert. We were inaccurate, which was really disappointing. “In the Scotland game we started really well and then tailed off a little bit. Then into the second half, they started the stronger and that’s something we have reviewed, how we came out in that second half because they got that momentum at the end of the first half. We did manage to redress it a little bit, but how can we be more consistent? “We talk about being relentless, we talk about being ruthless and how can we actually live [up] to those words a little bit more. That’s something we have addressed over the last couple of weeks. So, hopefully we can see a bit more of it come Friday night.” On the changes to the team, Browne explained that they wanted to have a look at a few players in a slightly different capacity, including Wood. “Tom’s a really good player. I know he’s under-19, but he was in various camps. We get to see Tom now in a competitive game, a competitive environment; it just builds that strength and depth which you’re always looking for.” Fullback Todd Lawlor is due to play an AIL match in the next couple of weeks having recovered from shoulder surgery, but it is unlikely that wing Derry Moloney, prop Niall Smyth, secondrow Alan Spicer and backrow Luke Murphy will be fit in time to play a part in the tournament, while Alex Usanov won’t. Wales beat Italy 20-18 at the Stade Comunale di Monigo last time out having lost to France in their opening game of the tournament. IRELAND UNDER-20: D Green (QUB); C Molony (UCD), C Fahy (Clontarf), E Smyth (Cork Constitution), C Mangan (Blackrock College); S Wisniewski (Old Belvedere), C Logan (QUB); B Bohan (Galway Corinthians), H Walker (QUB), T McAllister (Ballynahinch); M Ronan (Old Wesley), B Corrigan (Old Wesley); M Foy (UCC), B Power (Galwegians), É McCarthy (Galwegians, capt). Replacements: M Yarr (Lansdowne), P Moore (Blackrock College), A Mullan (Blackrock College), C Kennelly (Highfield), D Walsh (Terenure College), W Wootton (Sale Sharks), T Wood (Garryowen), G O’Leary Kareem (UCC).

Title: Trump’s SEC Leader Shifts Power From Investors to Boardrooms

New policies from the top U.S. securities regulator hand corporate boards more power over investors in ways that could curtail investor-initiated reform efforts on everything from climate policy to director contests, experts say. Since last month when U.S. President Donald Trump named Mark Uyeda acting chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency has made it easier for boards to block shareholder resolutions, put stricter filing requirements on passive funds, and limit investors’ communication abilities. The changes give directors more scope to nix efforts to have companies limit emissions or report workforce diversity details, while traditional activists running their own director slates could also find it harder to challenge boards, attorneys say. “It’s a relatively dramatic reallocation of power away from large shareholders back to corporate management, not just to make corporate policy but to protect themselves against activists,” said Tulane University business law professor Ann Lipton. Uyeda and other Republican officials – including Paul Atkins, Trump’s pick to run the SEC – have made clear their skepticism of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment considerations. “Shareholder meetings were not intended under state corporate laws to be political battlegrounds or debating societies,” Uyeda said in a 2023 speech. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Atkins did not respond to questions sent via his current firm. FEWER BALLOT ITEMS The SEC’s changes are in line with other Trump administration efforts such as dismantling diversity programs and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement. ESG resolutions drew significant support in 2021 and 2022, but less so since. In a February 11 legal bulletin the SEC made it easier for companies to skip votes on the resolutions such as by claiming the proposals “micromanage” their businesses. That change could make it harder for ESG-minded activists even to start talks with corporate executives. “If it’s harder to get your resolution through at the SEC, it will be harder to do that kind of work,” said Rick Alexander, CEO of the Shareholder Commons, which tracks and writes resolutions. On Feb. 11, the SEC also revised “beneficial ownership reporting” interpretations to broaden the requirements on firms like asset managers BlackRock and Vanguard, which often rely on the SEC’s Schedule 13G form to report major holdings. Going forward, the agency tightened when managers can use the form rather than the more complex Schedule 13D, which would increase their costs. A new SEC test is if a company “exerts pressure on management” such as tying director votes to whether a company has a staggered board or poison pill takeover defenses. Proxy voting policies of both BlackRock and Vanguard suggest those circumstances could lead to critical votes. BlackRock and Vanguard declined to comment. BlackRock temporarily paused meetings with some portfolio companies as of Tuesday with an eye on the new rules. Jessica Strine, CEO of shareholder advisory firm Jasper Street Partners, said the SEC’s new interpretation could have a potential downside for companies as well if they cannot know what their top investors think. “It’s not a complete gift to management teams if it means they no longer have engagement opportunities with their top shareholders,” she said. “That means they don’t get to make their case” before votes are cast at annual meetings on matters like executive compensation. Caroline Crenshaw, currently the lone Democratic member of the SEC via e-mail said the change could chill the big funds’ outreach. “The interpretation muddies the waters for institutional investors, with the unstated goal of dissuading them from engaging with corporations. At bottom, this policy is bad for capital formation,” Crenshaw said. COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN A third change involves new guidance on when investors can use the SEC’s electronic records system to distribute so-called “exempt solicitations,” or communications with other shareholders. Once meant as a tool to reveal closed-door discussions among bigger institutional holders, smaller investors started filing their own exempt solicitations as a cheap way to make their arguments on issues like whether to oppose a certain director or support a shareholder resolution. In a January 27 update the SEC narrowed their permissible use. The documents are “not intended to be the means through which a person disseminates written soliciting material to security holders,” the SEC said, but rather only to notify the public of written materials sent to security holders through other means. For Tom Quaadman, Senior Vice President for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a top business lobbying group, the SEC’s changes were welcome. “You’re seeing a rebalancing of SEC policies and rules that are designed to take out special interest activism and bring things back to a focus on investor return,” he said.

HOUSE PRICES CLIMBED last year at almost double the growth rate seen in 2023, leaving prices 16.8% higher than at the peak of the Celtic Tiger property boom in 2007. According to new figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO), residential property prices increased by 8.7% in the 12 months to December last year, up from 4.4% the previous year. House prices in Dublin rose by 8.3% in December, with prices outside of the capital up by 9%. The median, or mid-point, price of a house purchased in the year to December was €355,000, compared to €327,500 in December 2023. In the year to December, house prices in Dublin rose by 8.7% while apartment prices increased by 6.9%. The highest house price growth in Dublin was in Fingal at 10%, with South Dublin seeing a rise of 6.9%. Outside Dublin, house prices were up by 9.3% and apartment prices increased by 5.8%. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Border (Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo) at 14.2%. At the other end of the scale, the Mid-East (Kildare, Louth, Meath, and Wicklow) saw a 5.9% growth in price. The figures show that 5,177 property purchases by households at market prices were filed with Revenue last December, an increase of 2.3% when compared with the 5,063 purchases in December 2023. Advertisement The lowest median price for a house was €182,250 in Longford, while the highest median price was €660,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to December was A94 ‘Blackrock’ with a median price of €730,000, while H23 ‘Clones’ had the least expensive price of €131,000. Looking at the full year, the median price paid by households for a house was €355,000, compared with €259,000 in 2019, and €155,000 in 2013. A total of 48,775 dwelling purchases by households at market prices were filed with Revenue in 2024. This represents a 2.9% decrease compared with 50,234 purchases in 2023. The annual national index for 2024 reached a value of 183.4, which is 12.7% higher than it was for 2007 when it reached a peak of 162.7. Overall, prices of new dwellings have risen by 130.2% from their trough in the middle of 2013. Prices of existing dwellings are now 161.6% higher than at their trough in 2012. Commenting on today’s figures, senior mortgage advisor with NFP Ireland Gerry Griffin said affordability is an increasing challenge, particularly for first-time buyers. “While the pace of price increases has slowed slightly, demand remains strong, and supply is still struggling to keep up,”Griffin said. He said that if the European Central Bank proceeds with an expected interest rate cut in March, mortgage rates could fall, boosting borrowing power. “While this would benefit buyers, it could also drive further price inflation by increasing competition for available homes,” he said.

Even with lower interest rates, repayments will still be substantial given the high price levels. “For policymakers, the focus must remain on delivering more housing at a faster pace to balance the market and prevent additional pressure on prices.” Rachel McGovern, deputy chief executive at Brokers Ireland, said prices rose last year “at levels beyond what most industry commentators expected. “These levels are not sustainable except for those on high salaries and those wealthy enough to not be dependent upon mortgage finance,” she said. “There are appalling consequences for our society if policymakers don’t turn around housing in the near future and ensure that those on average incomes can achieve the ambition of owning a home. “We would call on the Government to be brave and decisive and not let another year pass before it acts on the recommendations of the Housing Commission in particular,” she said. Earlier this week, Cabinet approved €450 million in funding that is set to provide 3,000 cost rental, affordable and social homes over three years. However, Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin said the government is allocating less capital funding for social and affordable housing in 2025 that it spent in 2024.

Title: Franklin Templeton Brings Tokenized U.S. Treasury Fund to European Investors

Franklin Templeton, a major global asset manager, said Wednesday it has launched its tokenized U.S. Treasury fund in Luxembourg, expanding access to European institutional investors. The launch of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund marks the first Luxembourg-domiciled fund investing in U.S. government securities that's fully tokenized, the asset manager claimed in a press release. This means shares in the fund are recorded and transferred on the blockchain rather than through traditional processes, using Franklin Templeton's proprietary blockchain-based transfer agency platform for handling transactions to offer enhanced efficiency, transparency and security. The fund is available on the Stellar network (XLM) for institutional investors in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, following regulatory approval in October by Luxembourg regulators. The U.S.-registered version of the fund has attracted over $580 million of assets since its 2021 debut and is limited to U.S.-based investors only, per rwa.xyz data. Tokenized U.S. Treasuries have been at the forefront of red-hot real-world asset tokenization efforts, growing into a $4 billion asset class this year. Franklin Templeton was the first among traditional financial institutions to release such a product, and its the third largest tokenized treasury fund by assets under management behind Hashnote's USYC and BUIDL, issued by BlackRock and Securitize.

Title: Vanguard, BlackRock, And Citadel Now Hold 7.8 Million Additional Shares In Trump Media And Technology Group (DJT), With The Company Reporting Actual Billings Of Just ~$200,000 For 2024

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. When some of the biggest asset managers in the world start gobbling up shares of a company that barely makes any money, one is compelled to pause for a bit and wonder: "what do they know that I don't?" Look no further than Trump Media and Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT) as an emblematic example of this phenomenon. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Trump Media and Technology Group is the parent entity of the Truth Social platform, the Truth Plus content streaming service, and the soon-to-be-launched asset management and ETF service under the Truth.Fi banner. Despite its growing product portfolio, the company has yet to show any material earnings. For the year that ended on the 31st of December, Trump Media and Technology Group reported just $3.6 million in sales. What's more, when you remove the amortization of deferred revenue from this figure, actual billings for the year amount to just ~$200,000 (unearned revenue on the balance sheet declined from $4.41 million to 1.01 million by the end of 2024, implying unearned revenue recognition of $3.4 million vs. reported sales of $3.6 million). Nonetheless, Trump Media and Technology Group does have one thing going for it: its gigantic post-SPAC-merger cash balance. And, the company is now beginning to deploy its copious cash coffers to bolster its earnings. As we previously reported, Trump Media's board has now approved the diversion of up to $250 million from its current reserve of around $700 million in cash and cash equivalents towards setting up customized Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) and ETFs, including one dedicated to Bitcoin, under the Truth.Fi banner and in partnership with Charles Schwab and Yorkville advisors. Coming back, the requisite Form 13-F filings for the previous quarter - which are now available for public scrutiny - contained a shocker: Vanguard, BlackRock, and Citadel increased their stake in Trump Media and Technology Group by a combined 7.8 million shares, and this is before the launch of the company's asset management service under the Truth.Fi banner. Of course, it is quite likely that these asset managers were simply betting on President Trump's star power to drive further gains. After all, DJT is not a stock that trades on fundamentals. Meanwhile, in another unusual development, Trump Media and Technology Group has now sued a Brazilian supreme court judge in Miami for illegally censoring right-wing voices on social media. The judge in question is currently overseeing a number of investigations into the affairs of the former Brazilian president and a staunch Trump ally, Jair Bolsonaro.

Title: Scalable Capital to open access to private equity

With a new segment on its digital investment platform, Scalable Capital is setting new standards for investors: Soon, suitable investors in Germany will get access to alternative investments such as private equity. 0 19 February 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. Through the Scalable Broker, they will be able to invest in companies that are not listed on stock exchanges for the first time. Until now, benefiting from this additional return and diversification potential has been primarily reserved for professional investors. At the start of the new offer, Scalable Capital is the first digital investment platform to offer access to the BlackRock Private Equity Fund. The fund is managed by BlackRock, one of the world's leading private markets investors trusted to manage 450 billion US dollars in alternative assets.(1) After a minimum one-off investment from 10,000 euros, the fund is also available in a savings plan. There are no front-end loads for the fund. This is a further step in the endeavour to open up the entire investment spectrum to long-term oriented investors for their financial future."As alternative investments such as private equity are becoming increasingly relevant for participation in economic growth, we now make them accessible to our investors," says Julius Weller, Vice President Broker at Scalable Capital. "With the expansion of our investment platform to include this segment, clients gain access to the high return potential of private companies. We also achieve the favourable terms and simple handling for private equity that Scalable Capital is known for."An attractive, strongly growing investment market outside of the stock exchangesGlobally, the vast majority (88%) of companies with a turnover of more than 100 million US dollars is privately held - hence not listed.(2) Making these companies investable creates a huge new investment universe that could continue to grow in the coming years, as the share of listed companies has been continuously declining for two decades. In Europe, the number of listed companies has fallen by almost 23% since 2009, while the number of private companies has risen by over 17%.(3) Germany showcases a distinct extreme in relation to this development. Here, over 98% of companies with more than 100 million euro turnover are privately owned.(4) These include numerous ‘hidden champions’ that are global market leaders in their field and represent the strength and innovative power of mid-market enterprises. Companies worldwide instead of going public prefer to remain private completely or significantly longer than before and are increasingly financing themselves via private equity. One reason for this shift is the growing need for long-term financing that private equity can offer, to adapt to advancements like artificial intelligence; additionally, accessing this capital has become more attainable. Private equity also offers more flexibility in the development of business models and strategies, contrary to what was often assumed in the past. As a result, a large part of economic value creation is shifting to the private markets. Their invested volume almost quadrupled globally between 2013 and 2023 to USD 15 trillion and is expected to rise further to USD 29 trillion by 2030.(5) Accordingly, the demand for private equity is increasing, as the asset class offers suitable investors additional investment opportunities to diversify their portfolio with high return potential. For investors who have a long investment horizon, not needing to access their money in the short term and with the corresponding risk capacity, private equity has achieved 14.9% annual growth in US dollars over the past 20 years - outperforming the popular MSCI World Index.(6) In the context of asset allocation, analyses from the BlackRock Investment Institute indicate that a mix of private market investments can be sensible at up to 20% of a portfolio. Such an allocation to a traditional portfolio with 60% stocks and 40% bonds shows a better risk-return profile in historical comparison: the expected return increases from 5.5% to 7.2% over a ten-year period, while the risk disproportionately rises from 11.3% to 12.7%.(7) This return potential is now made available to Scalable Capital clients with the respective risk capacity. Long-standing expertise in modern fund structureThe BlackRock Private Equity Fund focuses on co-investments in which majority stakes in private companies around the world are acquired together with an established network of leading private equity managers (so-called buyouts). In order to make such long-term investments in the real economy accessible to suitable investors, the European Commission created a regulation called the European long-term investment funds (ELTIF) in 2015 and recently simplified it further. Contrary to many previous private equity funds, which were mostly closed, this fund is structured as an open-end fund. This means that investors are more flexible in terms of the time of their investment and can redeem invested capital more regularly as with closed-end funds after the second anniversary of the fund’s launch date. Returns and dividends are reinvested by the fund which may result in higher compound interest and higher returns in the long term. BlackRock has more than two decades of experience in investing in the private equity asset class on behalf of its clients. The co-investment approach enables lower costs relative to similar funds and broad diversification across sectors, investment periods and regions. Fund assets can be invested quickly thanks to broad market access. Co-investments also offer the advantage that several investors thoroughly check and analyse which companies to invest in.Christian Bimueller, Head of Digital Distribution Continental Europe at BlackRock: “We’re very excited to introduce our new Private Equity solution onto Scalable Capital’s investment platform, allowing wealth investors in Germany digital access to BlackRock’s private markets capabilities for the first time. With private companies increasingly driving economic growth, we are offering a unique opportunity for long-term investors to unlock potential returns blending with traditional public markets. By breaking down barriers to investing in private assets, we are enabling wealth investors to diversify their portfolios and access institutional-quality private market investments in a digital format.”Simple investment in private equity through seamless integration into the Scalable BrokerAlternative investments will be seamlessly integrated into the Scalable Broker. The access happens conveniently via the app, where manual and postal steps are no longer required. Investors in alternative investments can also expect automatic offsetting of capital gains against loss pots and exemption orders as natural as for all other securities. Scalable Capital has added numerous functions to its platform specifically for the new asset class: the fully digitalised suitability check, a two-week revocation option for purchase orders and a comprehensive range of information to make an informed assessment of the long-term investment on offer.New asset class first in the Scalable BrokerInterested parties in Germany can from now on sign up to a waiting list to receive regular updates until the planned start in April. They will also receive information on private markets investments and be the first to find out when the BlackRock Private Equity Fund will be available in the Scalable Broker.Shares can be redeemed for the first time two years after the fund's launch. After that, a sale is possible in general once a quarter. Due to the long-term nature of the investments, the total of redemptions are limited to 5% of the fund volume. There are no front-end loads nor redemption fees. The management fee for the actively managed fund is 1.95% p.a. If the fund exceeds its minimum return, the fund manager also receives a performance-related profit share.

In a meeting with the country’s top bankers, the Chancellor set out a plan to speed up settlement of securities trades which will make the UK’s capital markets more competitive to drive economic growth through the Plan for Change and put more money into people’s pockets. 0 19 February 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. The top brass from JP Morgan, Blackrock, Abrdn, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Fidelity, and Schroders were welcomed into No11 Downing Street for breakfast this morning, as part of ongoing engagement with industry to hone the Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy - one of the eight key growth sectors identified in the Modern Industrial Strategy.Rachel Reeves spoke about the importance of going further and faster to drive growth and revealed that the Government had accepted all recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group - confirming that the UK will move to a ‘T+1’ standard for settling securities trades from 11 October 2027.The change means that a typical securities trade, such as buying and selling shares, would be settled the day after it is agreed - instead of the current two-day standard. Faster settlement will support economic growth by putting the UK at the forefront of modernised, highly efficient and automated capital markets, bringing the UK into line with key international markets such as the US and reducing costs for investors by limiting risks when making trades.Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves said: I am determined to go further and faster to drive growth and put more money into people’s pockets through our Plan for Change. Speeding up the settlement of trades makes our financial markets more efficient and internationally competitive.Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, Nikhil Rathi said: We highlighted how the move to T+1 will make our markets more efficient and support growth in our recent letter to the Prime Minister. We will support industry as they move to T+1 and expect firms to engage and plan early.Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey said: Shortening the UK securities settlement cycle to T+1 will bring important financial stability benefits from reduced counterparty credit risk in financial markets. It is important that firms and settlement infrastructures have robust plans for an orderly transition in October 2027. As part of this effort, the Bank looks forward to continuing dialogue with regulators in other markets which are pursuing similar changes.The government has accepted all the recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group, which has created a detailed implementation plan to ensure a smooth transition to T+1, and confirmed that it will bring forward legislation to implement the change, including setting the date to move to the new standard. Terms of Reference have been published for the next phase of the project, which will continue to be led by the industry taskforce with Andrew Douglas as chair and HMT, the FCA and the Bank as observers. Industry chairs from the EU and Switzerland have also been invited to observe the UK industry taskforce to encourage alignment across Europe.The taskforce will oversee and manage implementation of the recommendations up until T+1 is successfully implemented, and for a short period afterwards to evaluate the short-term impacts.The government, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England support the industry recommendation to move to T+1 settlement in UK markets by 11 October 2027 and call on the industry to engage with the recommendations and start their planning as soon as possible.Notes to editors Stakeholder commentary:Tiina Lee, Chief Executive Officer of Citi UK said: We welcome the move to a T+1 settlement cycle in UK markets and appreciate the hard work in achieving the alignment of timelines with the EU. Based on Citi’s experience with global investors, coordinated market reforms are critical to the growth and competitiveness of the UK. We look forward to working with other industry participants to ensure a smooth transition in October 2027.Conor Hillery, Deputy CEO & Head of Investment Banking in EMEA, JP Morgan, said: We welcome the Chancellor’s continued dialogue with UK financial services on its role in facilitating growth, which requires the right policy and regulatory framework. This move to a modern T+1 settlement cycle will contribute to keeping London as a competitive financial centre, so we support the government’s efforts to make it happen.Clare Woodman, Head of EMEA and CEO of Morgan Stanley said: We welcome the UK Government’s commitment to move to a T+1 settlement cycle in October 2027. The shift to a shorter settlement cycle will generate market efficiencies supporting the competitiveness of UK markets.Additional notes: The Accelerated Settlement Taskforce recommended that the UK should move to T+1 by the end of 2027. The Technical Group was set up to recommend a detailed implementation plan, including determining the detailed technical and operational changes needed to move to T+1 as well as recommending a precise implementation date. The group’s recommendations are set out in The Accelerated Settlement Taskforce Technical Group report, published on 6 February. The government’s response to the report and Terms of Reference for the next stage of the project can be found on the Accelerated Settlement (T+1) GOV.UK page To support firms during the transition, the FCA has launched a webpage dedicated to the UK’s move to T+1 settlement, where firms can access further information, key messages and links to relevant materials. The Bank will support the relevant financial market infrastructures (FMIs) it supervises during the transition to T+1. It will discuss with relevant FMIs their preparedness for T+1 settlement and will encourage them to take appropriate implementation action. The businesses in attendance at the meeting in No11 were: JP Morgan; Blackrock; Abrdn; Morgan Stanley; Goldman Sachs; City; Fidelity; Schroders. Pictures will be uploaded to HM Treasury’s Flickr.

Full Content:
The mission, named 'Fasten Your Space Belts,' lifted off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand, at 12:17 NZDT on February 19 (23:15 UTC on February 18). The payload, BlackSky's first Gen-3 satellite, was successfully placed into a 470km orbit, strengthening the company's growing low Earth orbit network. The Gen-3 satellite was released using Rocket Lab's Motorized Lightband, a separation system that the company has provided for all previous BlackSky launches aboard Electron. Coming just ten days after the preceding Electron mission from Launch Complex 1, 'Fasten Your Space Belts' underscores Rocket Lab's increasing launch cadence. This achievement cements Electron's position as one of the most frequently launched rockets worldwide. With this latest flight, Rocket Lab has now conducted nine dedicated Electron launches for BlackSky since 2019, making it the primary launch provider for the company's constellation. Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, emphasized Electron's reliability: "Electron has proven once again why it is the trusted and dependable rocket of choice for constellation builders like BlackSky: control over when they launch on a rocket that delivers meticulous orbital insertion within their constellation. It's a service that really showcases Electron's strength as a market leader in launch, and one we're looking forward to providing again and again for our next launches for BlackSky." BlackSky CEO Brian O'Toole highlighted the mission's significance: "The successful launch of our first Gen-3 satellite represents a major step forward in delivering transformative, next-generation space-based intelligence capabilities to our customers. We look forward to commissioning this new satellite and delivering very high-resolution imagery and AI-enabled analytics at industry-leading speeds." This mission is part of an active launch schedule for Rocket Lab in 2025. Upcoming plans include additional dedicated Electron launches to expand BlackSky's constellation, launches from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia, and the highly anticipated first flight of Neutron, the company's new medium-lift reusable rocket.

Title: New Crypto to 10X as Saylor’s Strategy Plans to Add $42B to Its $BTC Stash
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/new-crypto-to-10x-as-strategy-plans-to-add-42b-btc/
Time Published: 2025-02-19T10:04:10Z
Full Content:
Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is now one step closer to adding another $42B worth of Bitcoin ($BTC) to its balance sheet by 2027. Most importantly, all of the raised funds will go toward $BTC purchases. Strategy’s $BTC bet is paying off, as evident from its stock performance, so more institutional investors may add crypto to their portfolios soon–and not just $BTC. We share the best new crypto to benefit from the upcoming bull run. Strategy currently holds $45.88B worth of $BTC. On February 10, the company bought 7.6K $BTC for $742.4M at roughly $97K per coin. This brought Strategy’s BTC Yield, a KPI that measures the change in $BTC-to-diluted-share ratio over time, to 4.1%, up 1.2% from January 27. In an official statement, Strategy explained its new convertible notes will not accrue interest, so their principal amount is fixed. Investors, too, retain the option to recall their notes at face value from March 1, 2028, or if the company undergoes a fundamental corporate transformation. MSTR price barely reacted to the news–in fact, it dipped 1.1% since yesterday. However, MSTR’s yearly growth of 373% proves Saylor’s strategy is working. Growing institutional demand for $BTC is the main factor that drives a broader crypto rally this year. However, not all established altcoins and new crypto on presale will feel the effects equally. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is one of the best meme coins that could explode when $BTC hits a new all-time high (ATH). When $BTC reaches the $150K and $200K price targets, BTC Bull Token will reward its community with $BTC airdrops. All you need to get free $BTC is to hold $BTCBULL in the Best Wallet app. Another massive airdrop, this time, of $BTCBULL tokens, will happen when $BTC hits $250K. The presale raised $2.3M in just a week, showing strong momentum. One $BTCCBULL now costs $0.00237, but the price is growing fast as more investors join the movement. Solana is now the fastest-growing blockchain ecosystem–the cumulative market cap of its tokens surged 9X in 2024. Unfortunately, the network struggles to handle the influx of new apps and users. This leads to congestion and, sometimes, failed transactions. Solaxy ($SOLX) introduces a Layer-2 solution that speeds up processing, lowers fees, and prevents network outages by offloading part of transactions from Solana mainnet to its side chain. It relies on the tried and tested Ethereum’s rollup architecture and thus is reliable for high-throughput applications like AI agent tokens and DeFi protocols. Solaxy’s native token, $SOLX, now costs $0.00164 on presale. Early adopters invested $22.2M into the project so far, and the next price uptick will happen when the project crosses the $22.8M milestone. After the $SOLX token launches on exchanges, it could reach $0.032. The much-anticipated deployment of Solaxy’s Layer-2 chain should support this momentum and help $SOLX hit $0.2 by the end of 2026. It might be time for Dogecoin ($SOGE) to retire, as another dog now dominates the meme coin sector–Broccoli. Broccoli is the dog of Binance’s founder Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ. Zhao received the dog as a gift from his Dubai-based friend and has since bonded strongly with the Belgian Malinois pup. CZ didn’t launch any tokens himself but promised he’d support top Broccoli-themed tokens on BNB Chain with extra liquidity. This triggered an influx of Broccoli coins to the market. FirstBroccoli ($BROCCOLI) is the original and best-performing Broccoli token. It hit the ground running the next day after CZ posted about his dog on X and already reached a $70M market cap. This morning, $BROCCOLI hit a new ATH of $0.0881 but has since corrected to $0.07, which might present an appealing entry opportunity for those who believe the token will see more upside. Strategy’s $42B $BTC expansion plan shows strong confidence in the $BTC-first, $BTC-only approach that made MSTR one of the best-performing US stocks. But for real investors, smaller-cap new crypto like $BTCBULL and $SOLX could offer greater returns due to their lower entry points. However, remember that the crypto market is volatile, and no gains are guaranteed, even with $BTC. Always DYOR and diversify your portfolio to offset potential losses.

Title: I lined up outside Costco to buy eggs right when it opened. They were gone in 8 minutes.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/costco-eggs-bird-flu-shortages-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-19T09:46:01Z
Full Content:
Egg supply issues in the US amid a bird flu outbreak have pushed prices to record highs and made it difficult for stores to keep cartons stocked on shelves. In a survey conducted by Numerator, a market research firm, over half of shoppers said they'd seen shortages of eggs or found them out-of-stock at stores, including BJ's, Costco, Target, Trader Joe's, and Publix. I visited a Costco store in New York City to see firsthand how consumers navigate egg supply issues and price hikes. Here's a play-by-play of how I managed to get one of the last cartons in the store. Manhattan's only Costco store is located at East River Plaza, a shopping complex in East Harlem. I often have to circle the parking lot and wait for a spot when I make my usual Costco runs on Sunday afternoons, but I had no trouble finding a place to park that early. Some people I spoke with said they hadn't arrived early to buy eggs but instead preferred to shop when the store was less crowded. They also said morning grocery trips worked best with their busy schedules. When asked why they were at the store so early, two people said they'd had trouble finding eggs at other stores and had come to Costco in search of an affordable supply. "People don't want to overpay for eggs," one shopper, who declined to give his name, told Business Insider. "That's why I stock up on them." "It's a shame. It's a shame how much eggs cost," another shopper who asked not to be identified said. I noticed scanning membership cards beforehand allowed for better traffic flow once the doors opened. Crowds gathered outside the store by the parking lot and in the indoor vestibule leading to the warehouse entrance. I estimated that there were around 30 to 40 people between them. It took some maneuvering for all the people and carts to fit through the doors, but overall, I found the process orderly and efficient. Some people stopped at the entrance to scan their cards again, but employees waved them through and said that wasn't necessary if they'd been processed outside. I've shopped at Costco stores in the Midwest and Iceland. The busiest location is Costco in New York City. I'd never seen the aisles look so spacious. I figured it was best to head straight there just in case the eggs went quickly. I was surprised to find that there weren't any sets of five dozen cage-free eggs for sale, only smaller cartons with two dozen eggs. A Costco employee told me that egg deliveries have been inconsistent and that the store's stock varies daily. Since the Manhattan location hadn't received any eggs that morning, the cartons in stock were likely leftover from closing the day before, the employee said. My neighbors and I occasionally pick up items from Costco for each other. They bought me some cheese on their latest shopping trip, so I owed them a favor. I stayed in the refrigerated section to see how long it would take for the eggs to sell out. I watched several shoppers, who had also arrived early, walk into the refrigerated section. They seemed to express disappointment after seeing the eggs were sold out. I saw one person with six packages of eggs in their cart, but for the most part, shoppers took one or two cartons each when I was in the store. Some Costco locations have limited customers to three egg cartons per person, but policies appear to vary by store. Costco representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The average price of a dozen large eggs in US cities was $4.95 as of January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Costco's price during my visit was 70 cents lower than the national average. In my experience, Manhattan's Costco usually has a small line of people waiting outside before it opens, but this shopping trip felt different. The strategic planning required to buy a carton of eggs reminded me of the frantic rush of securing Taylor Swift's Eras Tour tickets. In this economy, eggs no longer feel like a basic grocery staple. They're a hot luxury item that flies off the shelves, available to the most devoted fans. Jump to

Chancellor hosts senior representatives of investment banking and asset management sectors in No11 to hone Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy. Meeting comes as government goes further and faster to drive economic growth through the Plan for Change by speeding up settlement of securities trading, such as buying and selling shares. Change brings the UK in line with best-in-class international markets such as the US, strengthens capital markets competitiveness, and cut costs for investors. The government, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England support the industry recommendation to move to T+1 settlement in UK markets by 11 October 2027 and call on industry to engage with the recommendations and start their planning as soon as possible. In a meeting with the country’s top bankers, the Chancellor set out a plan to speed up settlement of securities trades which will make the UK’s capital markets more competitive to drive economic growth through the Plan for Change and put more money into people’s pockets. The top brass from JP Morgan, Blackrock, Abrdn, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Fidelity, and Schroders were welcomed into No11 Downing Street for breakfast this morning, as part of ongoing engagement with industry to hone the Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy – one of the eight key growth sectors identified in the Modern Industrial Strategy. Rachel Reeves spoke about the importance of going further and faster to drive growth and revealed that the Government had accepted all recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group – confirming that the UK will move to a ‘T+1’ standard for settling securities trades from 11 October 2027. The change means that a typical securities trade, such as buying and selling shares, would be settled the day after it is agreed – instead of the current two-day standard. Faster settlement will support economic growth by putting the UK at the forefront of modernised, highly efficient and automated capital markets, bringing the UK into line with key international markets such as the US and reducing costs for investors by limiting risks when making trades. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves said: I am determined to go further and faster to drive growth and put more money into people’s pockets through our Plan for Change. Speeding up the settlement of trades makes our financial markets more efficient and internationally competitive. Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, Nikhil Rathi said: We highlighted how the move to T+1 will make our markets more efficient and support growth in our recent letter to the Prime Minister. We will support industry as they move to T+1 and expect firms to engage and plan early. Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey said: Shortening the UK securities settlement cycle to T+1 will bring important financial stability benefits from reduced counterparty credit risk in financial markets. It is important that firms and settlement infrastructures have robust plans for an orderly transition in October 2027. As part of this effort, the Bank looks forward to continuing dialogue with regulators in other markets which are pursuing similar changes. The government has accepted all the recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group, which has created a detailed implementation plan to ensure a smooth transition to T+1, and confirmed that it will bring forward legislation to implement the change, including setting the date to move to the new standard. Terms of Reference have been published for the next phase of the project, which will continue to be led by the industry taskforce with Andrew Douglas as chair and HMT, the FCA and the Bank as observers. Industry chairs from the EU and Switzerland have also been invited to observe the UK industry taskforce to encourage alignment across Europe. The taskforce will oversee and manage implementation of the recommendations up until T+1 is successfully implemented, and for a short period afterwards to evaluate the short-term impacts. The government, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England support the industry recommendation to move to T+1 settlement in UK markets by 11 October 2027 and call on the industry to engage with the recommendations and start their planning as soon as possible. Stakeholder commentary: Tiina Lee, Chief Executive Officer of Citi UK said: We welcome the move to a T+1 settlement cycle in UK markets and appreciate the hard work in achieving the alignment of timelines with the EU. Based on Citi’s experience with global investors, coordinated market reforms are critical to the growth and competitiveness of the UK. We look forward to working with other industry participants to ensure a smooth transition in October 2027. Conor Hillery, Deputy CEO & Head of Investment Banking in EMEA, JP Morgan, said: We welcome the Chancellor’s continued dialogue with UK financial services on its role in facilitating growth, which requires the right policy and regulatory framework. This move to a modern T+1 settlement cycle will contribute to keeping London as a competitive financial centre, so we support the government’s efforts to make it happen. Clare Woodman, Head of EMEA and CEO of Morgan Stanley International said: We welcome the UK Government’s commitment to move to a T+1 settlement cycle in October 2027. The shift to a shorter settlement cycle will generate market efficiencies supporting the competitiveness of UK markets. Additional notes: The Accelerated Settlement Taskforce recommended that the UK should move to T+1 by the end of 2027. The Technical Group was set up to recommend a detailed implementation plan, including determining the detailed technical and operational changes needed to move to T+1 as well as recommending a precise implementation date. The group’s recommendations are set out in The Accelerated Settlement Taskforce Technical Group report, published on 6 February. The government’s response to the report and Terms of Reference for the next stage of the project can be found on the Accelerated Settlement (T+1) GOV.UK page To support firms during the transition, the FCA has launched a webpage dedicated to the UK’s move to T+1 settlement, where firms can access further information, key messages and links to relevant materials. The Bank will support the relevant financial market infrastructures (FMIs) it supervises during the transition to T+1. It will discuss with relevant FMIs their preparedness for T+1 settlement and will encourage them to take appropriate implementation action. The businesses in attendance at the meeting in No11 were: JP Morgan; Blackrock; Abrdn; Morgan Stanley; Goldman Sachs; Citi; Fidelity; Schroders. Pictures will be uploaded to HM Treasury’s Flickr.

Title: Germany Goes To The Polls On The 23rd February

BERLIN, GERMANY - FEBRUARY 03: Friedrich Merz, chancellor candidate and leader of the Christian ... [+] Democrats (CDU), speaks to delegates at a CDU party congress on February 03, 2025 in Berlin, Germany. The congress is taking place following Merz's recent controversial move in the Bundestag, in which he sought to push through legislation on immigration and security, knowing it depended on support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Germany faces snap parliamentary elections on February 23. (Photo by Maja Hitij/Getty Images) We are now a few days away from the German general election (February 23), which is becoming even more significant in the context of the Munich Peace Conference where pronouncements from America officials that the U.S. is pushing Europe to take a greater role in its defense (and in that of Ukraine), and in particular the courting of the far-right AfD by both Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance, have proven highly controversial. As we write the center-right CDU has close to 30% in polls, the AfD has 21%, the SDP 15% and the Greens are on 13%. My sense is that the next Chancellor will be Friedrich Merz, the leader of the CDU (allied to the CSU in the south of Germany), and he will lead a coalition, most likely made up of the Social Democrats – where Olaf Scholz might be deposed as leader (by Boris Pistorius) if that party does not perform well. It is possible, given their hawkish stance on Russia that the Green party might also be part of the coalition. At the same time, it is not clear whether the FDP — currently a coalition partner, will garner enough votes to take part in parliament, and the same is true to the far-left, nationalist Sahra Wagenknecht party. The context to the election is important. Germany’s economy has been moribund – weighed down by the shock of the war in Ukraine, a muddled energy policy, the constraints that planning laws put on urban development and a growing debate on immigration, amidst several terror attacks. The economy, immigration and to a lesser extent military spending are the main issues in the campaign. In particular, Merz — a corporate lawyer and former chairman of BlackRock in Germany — has recently upped the ante on immigration, and a week ago proposed a new policy on border control in parliament. The fact that the far-right AfD voted with this proposal caused consternation because the mainstream political parties in Germany have a “firewall” on any form of cooperation with the AfD. In a subsequent public speech Merz stood his ground and re-affirmed his tougher stance on immigration, in a sign that he is prepared to take much bolder policy decisions than Olaf Scholz (who is seen to have had an indecisive chancellorship). The attention that American politicians and Musk have paid to the AfD is not only a sign of poor judgement on their part, but a development that will significantly damage relations between the U.S. and Germany. The AfD have little to no chance of serving in government. Assuming that Merz is elected he has several policy challenges. The first is to reform Germany’s energy policy, potentially by introducing more nuclear and fusion driven power, the second is to pare back planning regulations, and the third will be to find pragmatic ways around Germany’s debt bake in order to permit greater military spending (combat readiness is an very serious issue for Germany’s military). From an economic and investment point of view the question we are focused on is whether the coronation of Merz as chancellor will catalyze a change in sentiment in the German economy, and a recovery in the economy. The DAX index is already powering ahead this year and is one of the best performing equity markets. Once the election is over, the focus will be on the urgency and speed with which a coalition can be formed (compromised will need to be found on issues like tax reform, immigration and foreign policy), and the extent to which Germany starts to play a leadership role on the EU stage.

Title: While client climate commitments waver, some media agencies are doubling down

Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead When ad agencies first began signing up to the B Corp movement, execs hoped the climate-friendly status would appeal to new clients and draw industry recruits (as well as further environmental causes). Agency leaders still cling to that hope, but they do so in a changed political environment. Last week, Stagwell media agency Assembly certified its European and Asia-Pacific businesses as B Corps. Its U.S., African and Indian businesses are also going through the certification process. At the same time, global full-service agency Dept re-certified its B Corp status — expanding its climate and social commitments beyond its European base and across its global network. Less attention has been given to the companies pulling back from sustainability promises than to those retreating from diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) commitments in recent weeks and months. Amazon, Meta, Publicis Groupe and McDonald’s are among the companies that have reset their DE&I policies, for example. But following the inauguration of President Donald “drill, baby drill” Trump in January, climate commitments could well be the next frontline between right wing politicians and the advertising world. That month, the six largest banks in the U.S., including JPMorgan Chase, Citibank and Wells Fargo — as well as asset management firm BlackRock — announced their withdrawal from a collective agreement first signed at Cop26, which pledged to support net zero-aligned investments. The announcement came just a week before the Palisades Fire began tearing through much of Los Angeles County. “There’s quite a lot of negative discourse at the moment surrounding sustainability and companies pulling targets and their commitments,” said Gaby Sethi, head of global impact at Assembly. In addition to its B Corp certification, ​​Wayne Blodwell, Assembly’s recently appointed global svp of programmatic, has been tasked with making the agency’s media trading practices more environmentally sustainable, according to Sethi. “We are using this as a moment to double down on what we’re doing and why we’re doing it, and making sure that our people know that we’re not going to be swayed,” she said. It’s a marked change from the business atmosphere of just a few years ago, when companies forged ahead on climate promises and the industry’s biggest players made public pledges to reduce advertising’s direct impact on the environment. Since 2022 GroupM, for example, has worked to reduce its carbon emissions per media impressions by half, by the end of the decade. It’s unclear how far along the media network is in that goal, but in its most recent update on its progress (in WPP’s 2024 annual report), GroupM owner WPP reported it had reduced its CO2 emissions 18% year-on-year. A spokesperson for the network told Digiday that its commitments are “key” to competitive reviews, but especially for ones covering EMEA. It’s less of a concern for U.S. clients. B Corp status is a difficult label to acquire for many businesses — Sethi said the process took over two years for Assembly — and requires that companies alter the legal “articles of incorporation” documents to include commitments to the planet and society, as well as to shareholders. Where it matters to clients, though, is during the initial stages of a competitive pitch. In October, for example, Chocolate brand Tony’s Chocolonely, for example, partially credited its decision to work with agency Total Mediaplus to its B Corp status. Similarly, Sethi credited two client wins to the agency certifying as a B Corp, though she declined to name the new accounts. “Having the B Corp status has been really important,” she told Digiday. For the most part, however, climate and sustainability commitments remain common ”hygiene factors” for brands reviewing prospective partners — not “deciding factors” — according to MediaSense’s chief strategy officer, Ryan Kangisser. “You want to know that you’re doing business with companies that are focused on the right things,” he said. “I don’t think we’ve won any pitches on being B Corp in itself,” said Dept CEO Dimi Albers, who added that the badge gave agencies a calling card that expressed their values to clients. It hadn’t tipped Dept over the edge in a pitch, but he said: “Informally, I think it’s a massive difference maker.” Even if B Corp status or other environmental commitments aren’t deciding factors for clients, they do help agencies recruit staff. Albers said Dept’s B Corp status had helped it hire new talent since it first qualified, while Sethi told Digiday: “We’ve started to see it come [up] in the conversations we’re having with candidates.” Ultimately, a claim to have access to the best talent can also become a selling point for an agency’s new business team. “For clients, that’s music to their ears,” said Kangisser. Agencies act downstream of their clients, though. Before Citi Bank and JP Morgan Chase cut their ties to the Net Zero Banking Alliance, several brands had already decided their commitments to climate-friendly business had become obstacles. In 2024, Nike laid off sustainability staffers during its summer restructuring; Crocs set its net zero target back another 10 years to 2040; and Coca-Cola and Nestlé missed virgin plastic-reduction targets. That July four Havas agencies — the holding company was the first of the big agencies to embrace B Corp as a vehicle for environmental and social progress — were stripped of their accreditation by B Lab, the company that manages the scheme, after it decided Havas Media Network’s appointment to Shell’s global media account was ”a breach of the B Corp community’s core values.” And the Global Media Sustainability Framework (GMSF), initially unveiled by the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) and Ad Net Zero at Cannes Lions — was then left without its central patron after GARM folded under the pressure of an Elon Musk lawsuit. After years of mounting climate commitments from advertisers, Dept global impact lead Pooja Dingidal said companies must now factor in a political “backlash” to their thinking about risk. Meanwhile, those that would like to jettison eco-friendly policies to aid the bottom line have the political cover to do so. It would be unsurprising if, now that some advertisers are taking their foot off the gas, agencies consider following in their wake. While Assembly and Dept are sticking to their promises — others may decide that if clients aren’t impressed, the work of B Corp accreditation or net zero targets aren’t worth it. Last spring after working with activist Monica Lewinsky on its “You’ve Got the Power” campaign, which featured Lewinsky, encouraged voter registration and ultimately became a viral hit, was an inflection point for the brand. While advertisers increase spending in Amazon DSP, the platform still has a long way to go. Publicis on Tuesday said it plans to acquire Brazil-based influencer marketing company BR Media Group, which has access to a network of some 500,000 creators – 80% of whom are the region’s largest influencers, according to the company. Pending regulatory approval, the deal is expected to close in late March 2025. Financial terms were not made available.

February 18, 2025 20:09 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, Feb. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of all investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025. Merck is a global healthcare company. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) Misled Investors Regarding the Projected Revenue Outlook and Growth of Gardasil According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck’s projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval developments, such as China’s approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen. In truth, Merck’s optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality. The complaint alleges that on February 4, 2025, Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” On this news, Merck's stock price fell more than 9%, from $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025.

Title: MFC Asset promotes initial Ethereum ETF

MFC Asset Management is launching Thailand's first Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) to invest in the world's second-largest cryptocurrency amid the boom in the asset class, rallied in part by US President Donald Trump's pro-crypto policies. Thanachot Rungsitthiwat, managing director of MFC, said the company is launching the MFC Ethereum ETF Tracker Fund (METHETF-UI), which is restricted to institutional and ultra-accredited investors (UI). The fund focuses on investing in Ethereum. The company introduced MFC Bitcoin ETF Tracker Fund (MBTCETF-UI) in 2024, which allowed investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, with the fund size topping 10 billion baht. Given that success, MFC decided to introduce the Ethereum ETF to match the growing interest in digital assets. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation after Bitcoin, is a programmable blockchain that enables users to deploy smart contracts, which automatically enforce agreements without requiring intermediaries or disclosing the identities of the contracting parties. Popular innovations built on Ethereum include stablecoins, such as USDC pegged to the dollar, decentralised finance, non-fungible tokens and GameFi, which is a combination of gaming and decentralised finance. Ethereum is the name of the network, while Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency used in the network to pay transaction fees on the platform. Mr Thanachot said the METHETF-UI fund invests in the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF as the master fund in dollars. The master fund is structured as a trust under Delaware state law and is listed on the Nasdaq. The fund is sponsored by iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor Llc and managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors. The master fund aims to reflect the price of Ether before fees and expenses by directly trading Ether on a peer-to-peer basis or through digital asset investment platforms. He said the highlight of METHETF-UI is it allows investors to access Ethereum investments through the stock market by investing in a master fund that focuses on direct investment. The fund is one of the largest Ethereum ETFs approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, with a net asset value of US$3.6 billion, and it reports high liquidity. METHETF-UI is classified as a high-risk or complex mutual fund with a risk level 8+. The fund is offered exclusively to institutional and wealthy investors. The initial public offering is open until Feb 27, with a minimum investment of 1,000 baht.

Title: 4 Under-The-Radar Stock Picks For Q1 2025 From Top Managers

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 24: Stock market numbers are displayed at the New York Stock Exchange ... [+] during morning trading on January 24, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Value stocks have had a difficult time over the last few years, but things could be looking up, especially for investors who seek out lesser-known names. In recent interviews with me, Jim Zimmerman, Abigail Zimmerman, and Ara Laterovian with Lowell Capital, and Ted Rosenthal with TMR Capital each shared their two top under-the-radar stock picks. Lowell Capital chose Macfarlane Group and Academy Sports and Outdoors, while Rosenthal selected REV Group and Celestica. Macfarlane Group is the leading specialist distributor of protective packaging materials in the U.K. It operates in the U.K., Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany, providing industrial and retail customers with a wide range of protective packaging materials. The Lowell Capital team was initially drawn to Macfarlane Group’s “highly cash-generative business model, ‘Ft. Knox’ balance sheet, sustainable and resilient business model, entrenched customer relationships, high ROIC business model, non-capital intensive business, disciplined management team, and long-term growth path.” The Lowell team highlighted Macfarlane’s resilient business model, reporting that it consistently passes along raw material pricing changes to customers. As a result, management focuses more on gross profits than top-line revenues. They believe it’s largely due to high switching costs among customers. Macfarlane Group has also gone through a successful turnaround and growth strategy under CEO Peter Atkinson. “We believe MACF can drive sales growth through accretive acquisitions alongside modest organic growth,” the Lowell team said. “We believe MACF’s highly cash-generative and high-ROIC business model can grow adjusted EBITDA from £36 million in 2023 to £45 million by 2027 with zero net debt and trade for 8x adjusted EBITDA for a market cap and enterprise value of £360 million.” They estimate that Macfarlane Group could be worth £2.25 per share, versus its current price of around £1.12 a share. Additionally, the Lowell Capital team believes the company could be an attractive M&A target. Academy and Sports Outdoors is a sporting and outdoor recreational retailer in the U.S., operating 282 stores across 18 states. The company is the second-largest sporting goods retailer in the country. The Lowell team was initially drawn to Academy and Sports Outdoors for its high cash generation, low cash flow multiple, strong balance sheet and strong growth prospects. They highlighted several characteristics that they like, including a highly resilient business model, a cash-generative business, and a strong focus on value-added services. The Lowell team also likes its attractive valuation at less than 5x adjusted EBITDA and high single-digit free cash flow yield, its record of strong sales and profit growth, its disciplined management plan and “Ft. Knox” balance sheet with net debt of about $100 million, its long-term strategy to grow sales to $10 billion and net income margin to 10% by 2028, and its high-ROIC business model with limited capital requirements. REV Group designs, manufactures and distributes specialty vehicles like fire and emergency vehicles, commercial vehicles, RVs, and related aftermarket parts and services. The company is the result of several bolt-on acquisitions between 2006 and 2020 and was founded by private equity firm American Industrial Partners. Rosenthal was initially drawn to REV Group as a short position because he suspected it might be overearning. However, he switched his thesis from short to long because record backlog growth quickly drove large price increases that haven’t yet appeared in the company’s financials. “As throughput and margins normalize in Specialty Vehicles, and as business rebounds in RVs (from depressed levels), EBITDA margins should expand to 11% by 2026,” Rosenthal explained. “Ten times normalized 2026 EBITDA results in 144% upside for a 49% IRR.” He added that REV Group enjoys a high and growing market share in an attractive oligopoly industry for its Specialty Vehicles segment, while Fire and Emergency demand tends to be stable because it’s driven by replacement cycles. Prices in F&E have risen 3% over the last few decades with no down years, and the industry has consolidated, leading to record-high backlogs and improved pricing power. “Business quality is also decent,” Rosenthal pointed out. “There is a lot of customization/ value add, variable cost structure, low maintenance capex, structural ability to drive attractive levels of return on invested capital, and strong revenue visibility in certain product categories with longer backlogs. Celestica is a leading electronics manufacturing services (EMS) and outsourced manufacturer that manages global networks capable of delivering customized supply chain solutions. Rosenthal was initially drawn to the stock because he was seeking a value-oriented way to gain exposure to artificial intelligence. He feels Celestica is an underappreciated AI play, noting that it’s trading at around 20x P/E. He estimates 12x 2026 EBITDA for 83% upside and a 22% investment rate on return. “CLS has historically been a decent business but always traded at a low valuation multiple because of its low margins and difficulty in predicting the business’ financials,” Rosenthal explained. “EMS businesses operate in a competitive industry (more so with consumer electronics, where CLS has minimal exposure) with very thin operating margins, are subject to the performance of their end markets, and there is very little visibility beyond the next quarter.” Market breadth increased toward the end of 2024, giving many value stocks a boost versus their growth counterparts. However, according to BlackRock, many investors have had limited exposure to value because it’s just a small portion of the market indexes. As a result, it might take a bit of a deeper dive to gain access to this segment of the market, either through value indexes like the SPDR S&P 500 Value ETF or similar actively managed funds. However, investors who are prepared for value to make a comeback will be better positioned for when it happens, like during late 2024. It’s anyone’s guess whether value will continue to hold on in 2025, but so far, things are looking up. The SPDR Value ETF is holding its own against the growth-oriented S&P 500, with both up more than 3% year to date. At this point, it looks like we’re in a holding pattern between growth and value, making it a good time to hold exposures to both.

Look back on the day's business news and developments as it happened with our blog. Disclaimer: this blog is not intended as investment advice. By Emily Stewart Prices current around 4:15pm AEDT Live updates on the major ASX indices: By Kate Ainsworth We'll be back again tomorrow for the latest unemployment figures coming from the ABS — but if you're hungry for more news, here's what's coming up on The Business tonight: Catch The Business on ABC News at 8:45pm, after the late news on ABC TV, and anytime on ABC iview.

By Kate Ainsworth The ASX 200 has ended lower on Wednesday, shedding 0.7% to close at 8,419 points. On the sectors front, energy and bank stocks dragged local shares lower — shedding 2.2% and 2.1% respectively. As for individual stocks, it was Mineral Resources which suffered the biggest hit. MinRes shares dipped by more than 21% in response to posting a loss of more than $800 million, and scrapping its interim dividend. Shares in NAB also fell during trade today, after the bank reported a 2% decline in cash earnings, and having its underlying profit increase offset by a higher credit impairment charge. The top performing stocks of the day were: And the bottom performing stocks: By Kate Ainsworth It's still company reporting season — and there's a few ASX heavyweights yet to drop their earnings results this month. Wondering who's left? Let this handy interactive calendar be your guide 👇 And if you need a refresher on how EBITDA differs EPS, look no further than this evergreen resource from the desk of Michael Janda: By Kate Ainsworth While there's more factors at play than just wages data for the RBA to consider before changing interest rates, Professor Fabrizio Carmignani from the University of Southern Queensland says he expects we will see more cuts in the next 12 months. "If I were to make a prediction, I would say that a year from today the interest rate could be somewhere between 3% and 3.25%,"he said. "That is because the overall macroeconomic picture is favourable to a reduction in the interest rate. "There are however some risks, the main risk is related to international trade policy, we will have to see what happens with tariffs. "Tariffs can obviously have an impact on prices and therefore they could represent the potential source of future inflationary pressures. "But in spite of this risk, I still believe there could be a few more cuts in the next 12 months." By Kate Ainsworth Optus's parent company Singapore Telecommunications (also known as SingTel) shared its third quarter profit update earlier today — with the telco company seeing its underlying net profit climb by 22% to S$680 million ($797,368,000). That result was largely driven by Optus, which is SingTel's biggest revenue generator. In the third-quarter, Optus's revenue rose by 3% to S$1.86 billion (roughly $2.2 billion). SingTel also noted that its profit was boosted by its stake in India's Bharti Airtel, which saw a nearly sixfold increase in its own third-quarter net profit. SingTel expects to pay a total ordinary dividend of roughly 16.5 Singapore cents per share. By Kate Ainsworth Professor Fabrizio Carmignani from the University of Southern Queensland says today's wages data shows the RBA's decision to cut interest rates was the right one. "The overall situation is one where inflationary pressures have been reduced quite significantly, and this explains why the RBA decided to cut the interest rate," he said. "This latest data on wages confirms that one of the main drivers of inflationary pressures, which is wages growth, is actually normalising. "Therefore I would say that, taken in context, the decision of the RBA aligns with the overall macroeconomic conditions that we observe in Australia." You can watch his full interview with finance presenter Nadia Daly below: By Kate Ainsworth Speaking in Adelaide, SA Premier Peter Malinauskas has stressed that the state government's decision to put the Whyalla steelworks into administration is about protecting the plant and industry more broadly. "There was an option that we could provide assistance to GFG and Mr Gupta [owner of GFG Alliance], there was an option that we could have bailed out GFC, but we are not going to do that," he said. "This is not about GFG, this is about the critical economic infrastructure that is steelmaking production in this country. "That is the future we need to focus on, not an individual owner of the steelworks. "Our mind turns to providing support for the industry and for the people that work within it to secure sovereign steelmaking in this country, not a bailout for GFG." Our colleagues in Adelaide are covering this breaking story too — you can read more about the SA government's intervention below: By Michael Janda The wage price index is designed to measure changes in base pay — it doesn't capture the effects of promotions, overtime, more people working longer hours and other factors that will push up the pay employees actually receive. A relatively new measure of total wages does, and was also released today by the ABS. It showed that employers paid a total of $102.0 billion in wages and salaries during December 2024, which was up 5.7 per cent from $96.4 billion in December 2023. "This was slower than the growth of 7.3 per cent in December 2023, which reflects the relatively weaker labour market conditions during 2024," noted Bjorn Jarvis, ABS head of labour statistics. "As an aggregate measure of total wages and salaries, the Monthly Employee Earnings Indicator captures all of the compositional changes in the labour market. This includes changes in employment, hours employees were paid for, pay rises and periodic payments. "It complements but is different to the measure of underlying wage growth reported in the Wage Price Index." The 5.7 per cent sounds a lot more impressive than the 3.2 per cent pay rise recorded by the WPI. But you also have to remember that the population grew roughly 2 per cent last year and an even larger proportion of the population entered the labour force. If you divide the total wages and salaries payments for December 2024 and December 2023 by the estimated number of employed persons (from the separate ABS labour force survey), then you find that wages and salaries per employee rose a much more modest 2.6%, or about $173 a month. This is very much a back-of-the-envelope calculation that compares two totally different datasets from different sources — one from the ATO's single touch payroll data, the other from the ABS labour force survey — so it is by no means an accurate estimate. However, it does serve to highlight that per person pay rises were a lot smaller than that headline 5.7% number suggests. By Kate Ainsworth Some breaking news out of Adelaide from our colleague Meagan Dillon — the Whyalla steelworks has been forced into administration by the South Australian government. Changes to the Whyalla Steel Works Act were rushed through both houses of state parliament this morning, before being signed off by the SA Governor. The steelworks, which was owned by GFG Alliance until today, has been in crisis after failing to pay tens of millions of dollars in royalty payments to the government, and millions in unpaid bills to creditors. Just days ago, GFG Chairman Sanjeev Gupta released a statement, saying the company would sell its stake in a New South Wales coal mine to repay Whyalla creditors. "This means that GFG is no longer running the Whyalla steelworks," SA Premier Peter Malinauskas said. By Emily Stewart You will have heard by now the big four banks have passed on yesterday's Reserve Bank interest rate cut of 0.25 percentage points to their variable home loan rates. But what about the smaller lenders? So far, 24 banks and credit unions have passed on the cut in full. Here's the list: Source: Canstar However, the lower rate won't be applied yet. The earliest date lenders will pass on the cut to customers is 21 February, the latest date is 7 March. By Michael Janda We're getting more reaction to the wage price index data out today from the ABS. With wages up 3.2% over the year to December while consumer prices rose 2.4%, workers enjoyed an average real pay increase over the year of 0.8%. In other words, you could by 0.8% more stuff with your base pay than a year ago (the WPI doesn't include pay increases from promotions, bonuses, etc). The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) says that is a bigger increase in real wages than under nine years of the previous Coalition governments. "Wages don't just go up by accident — they are the result of campaigns by union members and the Albanese government making it easier for working Australians to collectively bargain for pay rises, stopping big business wage cutting schemes and lifting the pay of some of the lowest paid workers in Australia," argued ACTU president Michele O'Neil in a statement. But Indeed Asia-Pacific economist Callam Pickering says Australians will need to see several more years of growing real wages to catch up on the period of high inflation post-COVID. "Adjusted for inflation, Australian wages are still 6% below their peak and, based on the latest wage and inflation forecasts from the RBA, that won't improve at all in the next two years," he wrote. "It highlights just how damaging high inflation can be and how long the recovery will be." He also believes current wage increases could result in higher inflation if they are not matched by improvements in productivity. By Emily Stewart Good afternoon! Business reporter Emily Stewart jumping in here to let you know what's happening on the local sharemarket. Another lacklustre day on the markets so far, with the ASX 200 down 0.4 per cent to 8,444 points and the broader All Ordinaries down about the same amount to 8,725 points (as at 12.35pm AEDT). The worst performing sector today is financials, with NAB down as much as 8.6 per cent, after a disappointing first-quarter earning result. CBA is also in the red (perhaps because it is trading ex-dividend today). Here are the top and bottom movers so far today: By Kate Ainsworth That's the assessment of the latest wages data from Professor Fabrizio Carmignani at the University of Southern Queensland. He told finance presenter Nadia Daly on ABC News Channel that the slowing pace of wages growth is unusual to see with historically low levels of unemployment in the economy. "What we have observed over the last several quarters is a decline in the rate at which wages are growing," he said. "What we have observed is that progressive easing of labour market conditions, which is consistent with declining wage growth. "I would say that unemployment outcomes that we had for the fourth quarter of 2024 was a bit surprising in this sense, probably there was the expectation that unemployment would be a bit higher, instead it continues to be very low. "So we are indeed observing, I would say, a progressive easing of labour market conditions, although unemployment still is performing at its lowest level. "It's an interesting dynamic in the labour market, absolutely." By Michael Janda After today's decision to cut the overnight cash rate (OCR) by 50 basis points to 3.75%, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand says it expects to keep cutting at future meetings. "If economic conditions continue to evolve as projected, the Committee has scope to lower the OCR further through 2025," the bank's monetary policy committee said in its post-meeting press release. That's a contrast to the RBA's communications, which very much played down the extent of further rate cuts after yesterday's initial move to 4.1%. But New Zealand is arguably a bit further ahead in its battle against inflation. "Annual consumer price inflation remains near the midpoint of the Monetary Policy Committee's 1 to 3 percent target band," the statement notes. "Firms' inflation expectations are at target and core inflation continues to fall towards the target midpoint. "The economic outlook remains consistent with inflation remaining in the band over the medium term, giving the Committee confidence to continue lowering the OCR." But it has come at a cost. Unemployment in New Zealand is at 5.1%, even after tens of thousands of unemployed Kiwis crossed the ditch to Australia over the past year or so. The economy has basically been stuck in recession for the past 18 months, with several quarters of negative or zero growth, including a contraction over the last six months of 2024. That makes this line in the RBNZ's statement seem a piece of artful understatement. "Economic activity in New Zealand remains subdued. "With spare productive capacity, domestic inflation pressures continue to ease. Price and wage setting behaviours are adapting to a low-inflation environment. The price of imports has fallen, also contributing to lower headline inflation." But the RBNZ is hopeful of an economic revival this year. "Lower interest rates will encourage spending, although elevated global economic uncertainty is expected to weigh on business investment decisions," the bank's monetary policy committee expects. "Higher prices for some of our key commodities and a lower exchange rate will increase export revenues. Employment growth is expected to pick up in the second half of the year as the domestic economy recovers." If the RBNZ proves too optimistic, New Zealanders looking for work may be left pining for the fjords (or a plane ticket to Australia). By Michael Janda No surprises here. The RBNZ has lowered its cash rate target by 0.5 of a percentage point to 3.75%, as expected by economists and financial traders. By Michael Janda The slowdown in annual wages growth to 3.2% over the year to December was in line with forecasts the RBA published yesterday as it cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years. The ABS wage price index was also in line with most economist forecasts. However, if you look at the RBA's November forecasts, it expected stronger wages growth of 3.4%. Go back further still to the set of forecasts before that, from August, and the RBA was expecting 3.6% wage growth for the year to December 2024. So that's a massive downward revision in the space of just six months. The RBA's economics department has a lengthy track record of consistently overestimating wages growth, including for many years prior to the pandemic. Perhaps they need to have another look at their economic models and the assumptions baked into them to find out where they are going wrong. (To be fair to the RBA, they are doing this, for example this recent research paper which draws on the experience of one of the new board members who was a Fair Work president.). My guess is that the private sector economists who believe the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is somewhere closer to 4% rather than the RBA's estimate of about 4.5% may be on the money. After all, if wages growth is decelerating with unemployment at 4% and many other indicators of an apparently "tight" labour market, perhaps those levels are not really that "tight" at all? Why should we care if the RBA's models are wrong? Because if wages growth keeps coming in below forecasts — and the RBA expects a re-acceleration back to 3.4% for the year to June — then it can probably afford to cut interest rates more than it currently expects to. By Samuel Yang Shares of oil and gas producer Santos fall as much as 2.2% to $6.74, last down 2% The company posted lower-than-expected FY underlying profit of $US1.20 billion, a 16% decrease from a year ago, hurt by lower realised prices and slowing production. Stock fell 12.1% in 2024. By Michael Janda The Australian Bureau of Statistics has just released its latest wage price index (WPI). And, even though unemployment is near multi-decade lows at 4%, wage growth keeps falling sharply. Base pay grew just 3.2% over the year to December, down from 3.6% over the year to September and 4.1% over the year to June. It's a very rapid deceleration. "The 0.7 per cent rise this quarter was the equal lowest growth since March quarter 2022," said Michelle Marquardt, ABS head of prices statistics. "At 3.2 per cent, the annual increase in wages was down from 4.2 per cent in December quarter 2023 and is the equal lowest since September quarter 2022." By Samuel Yang The Australian share market has opened sharply lower, tracking losses on Wall Street. The ASX 200 index was down 85 points or 1 per cent to 8,396 by 10:27am AEDT, with financials (-2.5pc) and real estate (-1.7pc) leading the losses. Here are the top and bottom movers at open.

Title: Whale watch: Reddit stock has nearly tripled in recent months, and one major hedge fund made a $1 billion bet last quarter as it soared

A closely followed hedge fund bet big on Reddit stock last quarter. Coatue Management, a hedge fund led by former Tiger Management employee Philippe Laffont, reported a 6.5 million share stake in the social media company in its latest 13F. The filing, made with the SEC last week and as of December 31, revealed that the nearly $1.1 billion Reddit stake made up about 3.6% of Coatue's $59 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks. According to Bloomberg, the hedge fund returned 19% in 2024 compared to the S&P 500's gain of about 23%. The hedge fund's recently established stake in the social media company has already proven profitable if it has held onto the shares so far this year. Based on current prices, Coatue's Reddit stake is worth about $1.2 billion, representing a year-to-date gain of $141 million, assuming the hedge fund is still holding onto the stock. While the exact price the fund paid for the stock is not known, shares of Reddit have surged 14% since in 2025 and are up 193% in the last five months. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has returned 4% year-to-date. Reddit's big gains over the past few months were driven by a strong third-quarter earnings report released in late October. The company revealed a surprise profit, year-over-year revenue growth of 68%, and a 47% surge in daily active users. The stock peaked at about $228 per share on February 10 and has declined about 20% since then. Investors are still digesting Reddit's fourth-quarter earnings results from last week, which revealed a 52% surge in expenses and a traffic hiccup due to a change in Google's search engine. "We expect Reddit to continue making progress across its full-funnel diversification while delivering strong revenue growth & improved profitability," analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a recent note, adding that future changes to Google search are a longer-term risk. The bank rates Reddit at "Neutral" and believes it is trading at about fair value with a $185 price target. Other significant moves made by Coatue during the fourth quarter included a broad sell-off of its Chinese stock holdings and newly established positions in Charles Schwab, Affirm, Okta, and Datadog. The hedge fund's three largest holdings as of December 31 were Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Coatue did not respond to a request for comment.

Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.90%) continued its strong rally a week after reporting impressive earnings, even as U.S. stocks remained relatively stable overall on Tuesday following the long weekend. Shares of the AI hardware company surged 13% on Tuesday, trading at $53 a piece. The sustained momentum comes as Super Micro’s latest earnings report reassured investors about its delayed annual filing and outlined an ambitious growth target for 2026. Super Micro is working to avoid delisting by Nasdaq, with a deadline of February 25 to submit its delayed annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CEO Charles Liang seemed confident that it would be submitted on time. Since last week, investors have been bullish about SMCI’s performance. In its earnings report, the company expects to reach $40 billion in revenue by fiscal 2026, while analysts anticipated $30 billion for that period. Last week, banking giant JPMorgan (JPM-4.10%) analysts raised the SMCI stock price target to $35 from $23 while keeping an ‘underweight’ rating. SMCI stock has risen 80% year-to-date. Super Micro makes hardware that supports AI applications. Last year, the San-Jose-based company went through many ups and downs. The SMCI stock thrived for much of 2024 and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA-0.32%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September 2024 when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following that, its auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned, citing disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence.

Title: Nvidia stock has clawed almost all the way back from the DeepSeek selloff

Time Published: 2025-02-18T19:37:00Z

Nvidia (NVDA-0.32%) stock extended its rally into a third day, rising more than 1% on Tuesday. The AI chipmaker’s shares have now regained about 90% of the ground they lost in panic-selling last month triggered by Chinese startup DeepSeek. At about $140 per share, Nvidia stock is still below its 2025 peak of $153.13, set on Jan. 7. Despite DeepSeek’s claims of lower costs to develop AI, new spending plans have since been unveiled worldwide, MarketWatch (NWSA-6.58%) reports, citing Bank of America Securities (BAC-1.62%) analyst Vivek Arya. These include a European Commission plan to mobilize €200 billion for investment, including a €20 billion fund for AI gigafactories. South Korea will buy 10,000 high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) this year, including Nvidia’s H100 and H200 models, to accelerate the launch of a national AI computing center, Yonhap reported Monday, citing Acting President Choi Sang-mok. And given strong demand, pricing for Nvidia’s existing chips may remain resilient despite the company’s transition to its new Blackwell technology, Barron’s reports, citing a note from UBS (UBS-1.29%) analyst Timothy Arcuri. Nvidia stock fell by more than 17% in just one trading day in January amid a global sell-off of tech stocks sparked by the release of China’s DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models last week. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang saw his net worth plunge by $18 billion as a result of the stock rout. The selloff was so pronounced that Nvidia did unusual damage control. “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,” a company spokesperson said in a statement at the time. “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.” —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

Title: Nvidia stock has cleared a big hurdle ahead of its hotly anticipated earnings next week

Nvidia stock cleared a key hurdle on Tuesday as it recovered the losses sparked by the $589 billion DeepSeek sell-off in late January. At its intraday high of $143.44, Nvidia was trading above its January 24 close of $142.62, the trading session before the GPU maker experienced the biggest one-day market value decline in history. The stock has since pared its gains on Tuesday to about 1%, trading at $140.34. Nvidia shares have been on a tear so far in February, rising about 22%. The rally has boosted the stock above several closely watched technical trading levels, including its 200-day and 50-day moving averages, as represented by the red and blue lines in the chart below. David Keller, Chief Strategist at Sierra Alpha Research, recently told Business Insider that he was watching $130 as a key line in the sand for Nvidia shares, another hurdle it recently cleared. The head of technical research at Oppenheimer & Co., Ari Wald, told BI that $140 is the key resistance level to monitor. With the DeepSeek losses mostly recovered and the technical resistance levels cleared, investors are eagerly anticipating Nvidia's earnings results next week. "The next important test for AI bulls comes on Feb-26 when NVDA reports FQ4 results," Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said in a Tuesday note. Arya warned that Nvidia's stock price could be volatile after the earnings results, likely due to a potentially subdued first-quarter outlook driven by the transition to Blackwell GPUs. However, the long-term fundamentals should remain intact. "We expect positive momentum to resume as investors look forward to NVDA's leading new product pipeline (GB300, Rubin) and TAM expansion into robotics and quantum technologies at upcoming GTC conference (Mar-17)," Arya said. Even after Nvidia's 20%+ rally this month, Arya argued that the stock's valuation remains "compelling" with a 24x price-to-earnings ratio based on 2026 estimates. That's at the lower end of its historical range of 25x to 56x, according to the bank. For its part, Super Micro Computer, which sells server racks integrated with Nvidia's GPUs, said on its earnings call last week that it expects to see an inflection in its revenue thanks to the rollout of Blackwell. "Highlighted by the beginning of our transition from Hopper to Blackwell GPUs, we expect the growth in new generation platforms to accelerate as supply ramps this quarter and beyond," Super Micro Computer's CEO and founder, Charles Liang, said Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

NEW YORK, Feb. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lowey Dannenberg P.C., a preeminent law firm in obtaining redress for consumers and investors, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) for violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired Novo common stock between November 2, 2022 to December 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). On January 24, 2025, a complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its officers, alleging that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo’s projected successful outcome of Novo’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo sought to demonstrate. When investors learned the truth, Novo’s common stock declined precipitously, injuring investors.

Title: Bird Flu Is a Rerun of the Covid Playbook
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/4298546/posts
Time Published: 2025-02-18T16:48:45Z

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/18/2025 8:48:45 AM PST by MtnClimber Bird flu can be very confusing. This is true because, as is so often the case with our government, those who claim to be trying to solve the problem – our so-called “public health” and “pandemic preparedness” “experts” – are actually the ones who created the problem. What is worse, they are actively seeking to perpetuate it. In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on, and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current Bird flu panic is this: Bird flu is a complete rerun of the Covid script. There is just one twist: Last time, with Covid, the pandemic-planning bioterrorists directly blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, in order to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during Covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

It was enough to anger me beyond belief, renewed as I grabbed my eggs for breakfast this morning. I penned this email to a local radio station not long after. I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices. Disruptions in environmental conditions and habitats can provide new opportunities for diseases to pass to animals.” https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf The irony is that the so-called vaccinations and culling are failing to protect the flocks, making them more vulnerable to infection, no different than humans and covid. This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows. But don’t take my word for it: Go look for yourself. 12 posted on 02/18/2025 8:47:01 PM PST by logi_cal869 (-cynicus the "concern troll" a/o 10/03/2018 /!i!! &@$%&*(@ -) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on, and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current Bird flu panic is this: Bird flu is a complete rerun of the Covid script. There is just one twist: Last time, with Covid, the pandemic-planning bioterrorists directly blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, in order to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during Covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus.

Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin https://freerepublic.com/focus/news/4296693/posts?page=48#48 I was in a chain grocery Friday and noticed that a dozen GENERIC eggs was priced at $4.85...and each additional dozen was >$9.00. It was enough to anger me beyond belief, renewed as I grabbed my eggs for breakfast this morning. I penned this email to a local radio station not long after. I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices. Disruptions in environmental conditions and habitats can provide new opportunities for diseases to pass to animals.” https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf The irony is that the so-called vaccinations and culling are failing to protect the flocks, making them more vulnerable to infection, no different than humans and covid. This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows. But don’t take my word for it: Go look for yourself. 12 posted on 02/18/2025 8:47:01 PM PST by logi_cal869 (-cynicus the "concern troll" a/o 10/03/2018 /!i!! &@$%&*(@ -) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Last time, with Covid, the pandemic-planning bioterrorists directly blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, in order to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during Covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during Covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6.

This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled.

The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows.

While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach.

Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices. Disruptions in environmental conditions and habitats can provide new opportunities for diseases to pass to animals.” https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf The irony is that the so-called vaccinations and culling are failing to protect the flocks, making them more vulnerable to infection, no different than humans and covid. This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows. But don’t take my word for it: Go look for yourself. 12 posted on 02/18/2025 8:47:01 PM PST by logi_cal869 (-cynicus the "concern troll" a/o 10/03/2018 /!i!! &@$%&*(@ -) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President.

I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices. Disruptions in environmental conditions and habitats can provide new opportunities for diseases to pass to animals.” https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf The irony is that the so-called vaccinations and culling are failing to protect the flocks, making them more vulnerable to infection, no different than humans and covid. This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows. But don’t take my word for it: Go look for yourself.

Title: Intel could get split up by its rivals. Here's what to know

Chip pioneer Intel (INTC-3.83%) could see its faltering business be split up by its rivals. The chipmaker has become an acquisition target for its competitors amid recent struggles to compete for dominance in artificial intelligence chips. The company, which rose to prominence with its central processing chips for personal computers and data centers, announced in August that it was laying off more than 15% of employees as part of a plan to reduce capital expenditures by more than $10 billion this year. Intel was reported in August to be working with its longtime investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS-5.07%) and Goldman Sachs (GS-4.76%) on options to fix its business, including by splitting its foundry division (which designs and manufactures chips), cutting factory projects, and mergers and acquisitions, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Qualcomm (QCOM-1.15%), which designs smartphone chips, was interested in buying parts of Intel’s business, Reuters reported in September. Now, the chipmaker is reportedly facing separate potential deals that could split its business in two. Broadcom (AVGO-1.71%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-1.04%) (TSMC) are interested in Intel’s chip design and manufacturing businesses, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Intel’s shares climbed by 10% on Tuesday morning after the report, and is up by almost 30% so far this year. However, the chipmaker’s stock is down by more than 40% year over year. TSMC declined to comment. Neither Intel nor Broadcom immediately responded to requests for comment. Here’s what to know about the potential deals that could leave Intel split in two. Broadcom, which designs and develops chips used in smartphones and data centers, is reportedly looking into Intel’s chip design and marketing unit. The company has held informal discussions about making a bid with its advisors, but likely won’t follow through unless it finds a partner to take over Intel’s manufacturing side, people told the Wall Street Journal. The chipmaker has not made an offer, and could decide not to bid, the Wall Street Journal reported. TSMC is reportedly interested in Intel’s chip manufacturing plants. The Taiwanese chipmaker could potentially join an investor consortium or find another way to control some or all of the factories, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Trump administration reportedly asked TSMC to consider taking over Intel’s chip plants, but a White House spokesperson told Quartz that President Donald Trump is unlikely to support a non-U.S. company operating the foundry. Frank Yeary, the interim executive chairman of Intel, has discussed a deal with Trump administration officials and TSMC executives to separate Intel’s manufacturing business, the New York Times reported. Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has reportedly been involved in the discussions. The U.S. government would have to sign off on a deal between TSMC and Intel. The Taiwanese chipmaker could also face challenges from the Trump administration’s restrictions on immigration, considering that a large part of its engineering team is from Taiwan and other places abroad, people told the Wall Street Journal. Both Intel and TSMC received funding from the Biden administration’s Chips and Science Act, which was focused on boosting semiconductor manufacturing, research, and development in the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Mastercard Says It Has Moved Beyond Experimentation in Crypto, Focused on 'Real Solutions'

Traditional finance firms that have adopted crypto are moving past the experimentation phase and are actively working on real-world solutions, Mastercard’s head of crypto and blockchain, Raj Dhamodharan, told CoinDesk. “Many of us in the industry are moving beyond experimentation; it’s actually real solutions,” he said, noting that Mastercard has already enabled stablecoin payments for financial institutions. Those institutions can choose to settle transactions using stablecoins, reflecting a broader trend in crypto adoption. Last week, the payments giant announced a partnership with crypto compliance firm Notabene, which will integrate Mastercard’s Crypto Credential into its SafeTransact platform to make digital asset transactions more secure and user-friendly. The Crypto Credential system continues to be a focus of Mastercard’s efforts to make crypto more mainstream. It allows users to send funds using familiar identifiers like email addresses rather than complex wallet addresses while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. The system also helps prevent misdirected transactions by verifying whether a recipient’s wallet can receive a specific asset. “What is stopping [crypto] from going mainstream is really that consumers need to be able to find each other using what they already know,” Dhamodharan said. Mastercard’s goal, according to Dhamodharan, is to be a connector between traditional finance and blockchain networks, ensuring regulatory compliance while enabling new business models. The company plans to announce additional partnerships and use cases in 2025, reinforcing its commitment to integrating crypto into global payments. “As an industry as a whole, we need to be very open to making [crypto] available as broadly as possible,” he said. Previously, the payments giant partnered with several crypto-native companies, including Binance. The two parted ways in August 2023 after Binance faced a series of legal issues in the U.S. Mastercard re-allowed users to purchase crypto on the exchange again a year later. “Binance is a great partner of ours,” Dhamodharan said. “We continue to partner with them in a number of new ways where we can help them with on-ramp and off-ramp. Those are the continuing conversations.” Dhamodharan is also optimistic about the future of tokenization, which he said will require new business models to feed the growing demand for tokenization real-world assets by companies like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. “​​If there is more clarity over time in terms of how deposits can be represented in some form on the public chain, from a regulatory standpoint, I think this can even go to the next level in terms of how it can scale,” he said. In 2025, Mastercard’s focus lies on the on-ramp/off-ramp between crypto and the banking world, while making that process as smooth and safe as possible as well as expanding features and functions of its Crypto Credential product. The third focus is stablecoins, the company said. “We think the future is going to be a world of both deposits because that's where the money is, and that's where people and businesses hold money and stablecoins, which can move on-chain easily and get settled easily.” Read more: Mastercard and JPMorgan Link Up to Bring Cross-Border Payments on the Blockchain Helene is a New York-based news reporter at CoinDesk, covering news about Wall Street, the rise of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and updates on crypto exchanges.

Title: TSMC doesn't actually want to buy Intel. Here's why
URL: https://qz.com/tsmc-intel-broadcom-ai-chips-taiwan-trump-tariffs-1851765167
Time Published: 2025-02-18T15:58:00Z
Full Content:
The Trump administration’s push to have TSMC buy Intel’s chipmaking operations faces a major barrier: The Taiwanese firm isn’t actually interested, and even the threat of tariffs probably won’t be enough to force a deal. “TSMC (TSM-1.04%) has stated very clearly that it has no interest in taking a stake in Intel (INTC-3.83%), and running Intel’s fabs alone or in a [joint venture] would be equally unenticing,” Tim Culpan, founder of the media outlet Culpium and a long-time journalist tracking the chip industry from Taiwan, told Quartz. Intel stock surged 16% Tuesday on reports that TSMC and Broadcom (AVGO-1.71%) could each buy different parts of the company. The stock has rallied to start 2025. But TSMC’s leadership is a product of its culture, which probably wouldn’t mesh well with Intel’s, Culpan said. “Intel didn’t fall behind because of a lack of funds or equipment,” he said. “It fell behind because of successive internal failures related to its approach to technological and business development.” TSMC is a foundry that makes semiconductors designed by its clients, not its own chips. So it likes to be neutral, both politically and among its clients and its suppliers. That would be more difficult if it ran the operations of a chip-design firm like Intel. Additionally, a joint venture with Intel would focus on advanced semiconductor technology, so TSMC’s advantage could be jeopardized by leaks, the Taipei Times reported last week, citing Liu Pei-chen, a researcher at the Taiwan Industry Economics Database of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research. President Donald Trump’s commitment to prioritizing U.S. interests may also put the firm at a disadvantage, Liu told the newspaper. He said the combined risks from a potential deal are great enough that TSMC would do better to accept American tariffs. Its technological edge gives it enough bargaining power to allow it to pass the added costs along to buyers. “It feels like the Trump administration is being poorly advised by people pushing their own agenda, not necessarily what’s best for the U.S.,” Culpan said. It’s a similar approach to President Joe Biden’s but more forceful — and could jeopardize American access to the world’s best chips. “The best solution for everyone,” Culpan said, “would be for TSMC to announce an expansion in Arizona, agree to make more chips for Intel and other U.S. companies, and boost cooperation in packaging, which is crucial to AI.” Any eventual resolution between TSMC and the U.S government can be expected “to involve mutual concessions, ensuring that TSMC derives some strategic or economic benefit,” said Moon Surana, a portfolio manager at Harding Loevner, which owns the stock in its global equity strategy. “Historically, the company has prioritized long-term customer relationships and sustainable value creation over the pursuit of monopolistic pricing power,” she told Quartz. “A similarly balanced outcome is anticipated in this case.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: How Corporate America And Big Tech Are Forgetting About The Majority

LGBTQA+ pride flags in the Google sign to celebrate Gay Pride Month, Manhattan, New York. (Photo by: ... [+] Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) When I was younger, I had a lovely older neighbor who’d graduated from Harvard as a historian at a time when there was deep antisemitism. He’d share facts and printed old newspaper articles he’d preserved over the years to remind me of the many ways that businesses of every size turned a blind eye to fascism in Europe in the 1930s and significantly profited off of it. All of this makes the head-spinning declarations of loyalty to the Trump Administration that many companies have shown in recent weeks rather curious. Businesses ranging from Google to Meta to Target who once rushed to embrace Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion “initiatives” and celebrate Black History Month have rushed to erase signs of solidarity following the Administration’s various Executive Orders. Many consumers and shareholders feel betrayed. Small businesses and startup entrepreneurs who take their cues from corporations and big tech could be impacted by this sentiment too. But, when corporate practices are unpopular there is an opportunity to learn from their mistakes. Entrepreneurs and small businesses should consider consumer’s values and prepare to position their companies to meet the moment and stay viable as more and more people are purchasing products from businesses that align with their principles. A new Harris poll found that four in 10 Americans have shifted spending to align with their moral views in recent months. Specifically the poll results highlighted: Further, several of Target’s shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against the company on January 24, after the company said it would end DEI initiatives this year, including a program to support Black-owned small businesses that it adopted following the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. This betrayal shouldn’t surprise anyone who has cracked open a history book. In the 1930s Hugo Boss made uniforms for the Nazis. IBM supplied the numeric codes tattooed on those ushered into the gas chambers. And Bayer –the aspirin company– is the reincarnation of IG Farben; a huge donor to Nazi political campaigns, a manufacturing beneficiary of Hitler’s invasions of European countries, and a shareholder in the company that produced the gas the Nazis used to exterminate millions of people. Horrifically, the Holocaust’s atrocities turned out to be a whole lot less interesting to the corporate world than how it could be used to profit their businesses. And as Succession’s Shiv Roy declared in a scene with a potential whistleblower: “We don’t get embarrassed.” Let’s run some numbers on where America is and why embracing difference and the uniqueness of people’s lived experiences matters. It’s not just the right thing to do, it’s good for businesses’ bottom line too, and especially for startups and small businesses who rely on forging customer brand loyalty in their early days in crowded markets. The US Presidential election between Trump and Harris was extremely close. For votes counted through November 20th, Trump’s margin over Harris was only 1.62%, according to PBS. On a percentage basis, Trump’s 2024 winning margin was the fourth smallest since 1960. Another contributing factor to the election results is that voter purges have been on the rise election over election and purges historically impact people of color, especially Black voters, according to the NYT. Furthermore, the non-partisan organization League of Women Voters, as of November 6, 2024, tracked 64 anti-voter lawsuits filed in 2024 that sought to sow distrust in the election. Factor in the recent YouGov poll which found that 19 million people who voted for Biden in 2020 abandoned Harris in 2024, and one-third of those cited the war in Gaza in their decision. It was the top reason provided, beating out the economy and immigration, costing Harris more than 6 million votes. In states that swung from Biden to Trump in 2024, 20% cited Gaza in their decision to abstain from voting entirely. Bottom line: Trump did not win the election by a landslide and the majority of people in the US don’t support fascism or authoritarianism. Even current polls show Trump’s popularity with voters sitting at only 47%. People want to support politicians and businesses that align with their values. And that is exactly what many people are now doing so businesses and entrepreneurs everywhere need to stand with the majority. The widely reported mass user exodus from X to alternative startup platforms such as Bluesky has been accelerating steadily and bleeding money from X. The platform has become so alarming to several major advertisers that Elon Musk has mounted multiple lawsuits alleging boycotts. Since Musk endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party a month ago, Tesla’s sales are tanking across Europe. In some countries like Spain, Tesla’s sales are down as much as 75% year-over-year. The stock price is also down with analysts saying that Tesla’s favorability rating is nearing all-time lows and that this could hurt near-term sales. The unfavorable view of the brand is likely due to Musk. Target’s share price took a steep hit after eliminating DEI initiatives that its own shareholders have filed a lawsuit charging it with fraud. Meanwhile, Costco’s share price is up almost 15% after refusing such rollbacks (a decision backed by 98% of voting shares). Costco also has reported a surge in memberships compared to Sam’s Club which is facing declining memberships. “It’s a sign that consumers with liberal views are starting to use their wallets in response to politics in the private sector,” noted the Harris poll. While a mass exodus from a platform like Meta could be logistically challenging –not least because the US represents such a small percentage of its user base– and such a move has yet to materialize, it would be folly to dismiss it out of hand. More and more users are questioning Meta’s commitment to fighting disinformation and online harassment. As the US TikTok ban loomed, users swarmed to Chinese alternative RedNote, signaling both an appetite and capacity for swift mass mobilization. Such a mass abandonment of Facebook or Instagram alone would have tectonic financial implications, and not just for Meta; the carnage would cascade through the millions of businesses including many small businesses that depend on its advertising model. Even the threat of such shifts could trigger investor anxiety with consequences comparable to past service outages – a 5% dip in share price, equivalent to about $47 billion in losses. Target’s shareholders have already set a precedent for how this might happen. Ultimately, what the numbers tell us is that while some of the biggest companies are lining up to abandon their DEI policies to do business with the Trump Administration, they may find themselves at odds with their customer base who have very different lived experiences and will put their money where their mouth is. This reckless lack of foresight by CEOs should alarm shareholders because it’s consumers who hold the power of the purse. And small businesses and entrepreneurs should seize this opportunity to drive their operations strategy. Because without customers their businesses will cease to exist. *Disclosure: I was previously on the Board of Directors of the League of Women Voters.

Intel (INTC-3.83%) stock was rising sharply on Tuesday morning as investors weighed the benefits of reported plans that could see rivals acquire parts of its business. One plan could see Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which is already responsible for about 90% of the world’s advanced semiconductors, acquire Intel’s manufacturing business, The New York Times reported. It could also take a majority stake in the business alongside a group of private equity and tech companies. That idea has been pushed by President Donald Trump’s administration and Howard Lutnick, his nominee to be Commerce Secretary. Frank Yeary, Intel’s interim executive chair, has met with both TSMC (TSM-1.04%) and Trump administration officials about the deal, The Times reported. While the Trump administration asked TSMC to explore the idea, the White House is unlikely to support a deal that would let a foreign entity operate Intel’s factories, the Wall Street Journal reported. Broadcom (AVGO-1.71%) has also been examining Intel’s chip design and manufacturing business, The Journal reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. The deal, which Broadcom executives have only informally discussed, would hinge on finding a partner to take over Intel’s manufacturing business, The Journal reported. Nothing has been submitted to Intel yet. Qualcomm (QCOM-1.15%) has also been interested in buying some of Intel’s chip design units. Yeary has left the door open for other companies interested in buying Intel’s product business, including Qualcomm, The Times reported. Intel stock surged 10% in Tuesday morning trading. The stock has rallied to start the year. The potential deals come a few months after Intel ousted its former CEO, who failed to help modernize and stabilize the tech giant, which has struggled to compete with rivals such as Nvidia (NVDA-0.32%) and TSMC. The company has also hired help to fend off potential activist investors. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025 through measures including a 15% reduction of its workforce. The following month, the company said it would further separate its chip-manufacturing and design operations, and pause factory projects in Germany, Poland, and Malaysia. Despite its issues, Intel said last month that it expects to report break-even profit for the first quarter of 2025, after reporting declining revenue for three periods in a row. In November, the company was awarded a $7.86 billion grant by then-President Joe Biden’s administration to build semiconductors in the U.S. The Trump administration is expected to rely on Intel to make domestic chips, at least as long as TSMC declines to move operations to the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Bernstein Wants Broadcom To “Stay Away” From Intel’s Fabs, While Cantor Fitzgerald Thinks That A Split Of DesignCo/IFS Is A “Done Deal”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The past few days have been chock-full of rumors and tidbits regarding Intel's path forward, and the role, if any, that TSMC and Broadcom (AVGO) might play in salvaging the semiconductor industry's quintessential white elephant. Now, Wall Street analysts are out in droves with their insights on this very fluid situation. Last week, Baird analyst Tristan Gerra cited "discussions from the Asia supply chain" in an investment note to suggest that Intel might be pivoting towards a closer collaboration with TSMC to get its struggling fabrication units off the ground. Specifically, Gerra pointed to a JV-like arrangement between Intel and TSMC: "The fab could be spun off into a new entity jointly owned by TSMC and Intel, and run by TSMC." Separately, we know that Broadcom has also been eyeing Intel's fabs to complement its ASIC design business. Of course, those fabs require a significant induction of capital and talent to attain viability, especially when it comes to sub-2nm nodes. Over the weekend, we reported that TSMC might acquire a 20 percent stake in Intel's foundry business, either via a cash injection or enabling technology transfer. Other reports suggest that Broadcom and Qualcomm might assist a possible deal by placing sizable orders with Intel's fabs. This brings us to the crux of the matter. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse has now hiked the target for Intel shares from $22 to $29, while maintaining an overall neutral rating. The analyst notes: "The situation at Intel is extraordinarily complex, but where there is smoke, there is typically fire, so we do believe the news reports that suggest a split of DesignCo/IFS is a done deal." Muse believes that the Trump administration is pushing all concerned parties towards a deal to avoid a "GM like situation," with TSMC likely to emerge as the "most logical manager" for Intel's fabs. "We believe the current Administration is worried about lack of leadership and current net leverage at Intel (have not found new CEO; negative FCF) and does not want a GM like situation to emerge for the US’ Crown Semiconductor Jewel." Meanwhile, Bernstein analyst Stacy A. Rasgon wants Broadcom "to stay from the fabs, but would love to see what they could do with the products." While explaining his rationale, Rasgon argues that Intel's x86 businesses (CCG, DCAI, and NEX) are not necessarily "bad businesses on their own," managing to haul in "~$49B in 2024 sales & mid-20’s operating margin." Rasgon thinks that even if Intel's products are "potentially ex-growth, x86 CPUs would be complementary to AVGO’s current portfolio, and one would think overall execution should be far better than Intel’s." The analyst then lays out how a possible deal between Intel and Broadcom should be structured: "We would recommend an all-stock deal if possible. At a ~75% premium (~$40 take-out price, or a mid-high teens multiple) our rough math suggests 20%+ accretion even in a 100% stock scenario, and with very manageable leverage (well under 3x) across a wide range of capitalization structures." Of course, not everyone is upbeat on the prospects of Intel managing to spin off its fabs. For one, Bank of America (BofA) analyst Vivek Arya thinks that splitting up Intel "could be time- consuming and complicated given: 1) Extensive approval requirements from global (China) regulators due to INTC’s dominant ~70% share of PC/server CPU, 2) Mismatch between INTC and TSMC’s manufacturing processes, 3) TSMC’s ongoing fab expansion plans in Arizona with ability to serve AI customers, 4) AVGO’s existing low-levered but high debt ($58bn net debt) balance sheet, and 5) Constraints of INTC’s CHIPS Act funding (design needs to own 50%+ of manufacturing) and ROI requirements from co- investment partners Apollo and Brookfield." Also, Lynx Equity has asked "why would TSM wish to take a stake in Intel’s IFS" given the fact that global fab capacity "at leading and lagging nodes" is no longer in short supply, that Intel's fab business still offers "questionable performance at advanced nodes" and will not break-even until late 2027, and the "IFS’s tortured relationship with the US government via the CHIPS Act?" Lynx Equity argues that "coercion, via threat of tariffs on semis imports, could be a reason for TSM to come to the table," but that the "gaggle of media reports" in recent days could simply be a "trial balloon."

Title: The Future Of Investing: Fintech 50 2025

David Fortunato has worked at Wealthfront for 16 years and was named CEO in 2021. T he stock market has never been higher, but that doesn’t mean it’s an easy time to start a fintech aimed at investors. In an industry saturated with legacy players like Vanguard, Fidelity, BlackRock and Charles Schwab that offer easy access to funds for retail investors with minuscule management fees, it’s difficult to scale fast enough to offer a product to retail investors at a competitive price. It wasn’t always so. Forbes put Robinhood on our very first Fintech 50 list in 2015. Back then, the startup was catalyzing the race to the bottom in fees by offering commission-free trading. (Its business instead relies on the controversial practice of payment for order flow from the market makers who execute its clients’ trades.) The now-public Robinhood had a phenomenal year. Its stock has quadrupled since the start of 2024, fueled by three consecutive quarters with a net profit of at least $150 million. Its assets under custody at the end of November were $195 billion, up 106% year-over-year. We’re still searching for the next Robinhood. Just two firms were selected for this year’s Fintech 50 in the investing category, making way for more up-and-comers in other areas like payments and personal finance. That meant dropping a few multi-time list members like iCapital, a longtime mainstay which partners with financial advisors to expand access to alternative investments and crossed $200 billion in assets invested through its platform last year, but with a growth rate now more indicative of a maturing business than an early-stage rocket ship. One exception to the rule, Wealthfront, which was founded in 2008, made the first Fintech 50 list in 2015 and then dropped off until 2024. It’s been growing too fast to ignore. With $80 billion in assets under management, up from $55 billion a year ago, it has left every other new-age robo-advisor in the dust. Its revenue grew 46% last year and has soared 260% in a two-year span, from $80 million in 2022 to $289 million in 2024. It charges a 0.25% management fee and also earns some interest on customers’ cash deposits and loans it extends. The lone other investing startup on the list, Capitalize, is appearing for the second straight year after raising a $19 million Series B round in August. Capitalize simplifies the task of tracking down and rolling over old 401(k) accounts, a useful service given the growing prevalence of workplace retirement savings accounts, even if job-hopping has slowed from its frenzied pace in 2022. Capitalize is free for individual users and generates revenue by charging IRA providers like Robinhood, SoFi or Schwab for facilitating asset transfers onto their platforms. Headquarters: New York, New York. Capitalize helps users track down and combine old 401(k) accounts—the company estimates there’s $1.65 trillion in unclaimed retirement assets out there—into a rollover IRA at one of its partners, which include Schwab, SoFi and Betterment. It replaces the tedious process of phone calls and paperwork with a simple online experience and also serves financial institutions, which can integrate Capitalize’s software to handle rollovers for their clients. In 2024, the company added Ellevest and M1 to its roster of rollover IRA partners and raised $19 million in Series B funding. Funding: $35 million from RRE, Canapi and Walkabout, among others. Bona fides: Increased annualized rollover volume on the platform in 2024 to $3 billion from $750 million the year before. Cofounders: CEO Gaurav Sharma, 40, a veteran of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, JPMorgan’s Highbridge and UBS; CTO Christopher Phillips, 49, who was CTO for IAC’s Applications Group. Headquarters: Palo Alto, California. Wealthfront is a profitable robo-advisor with $80 billion in assets under management in prepackaged stock and bond portfolios and cash accounts currently yielding 4% interest. Its $289 million in revenue comes from the 0.25% management fee it charges, interest on customers’ cash deposits it earns from partner banks and interest from loans it makes, among other business lines. In May 2024, it introduced an automated bond ladder for users offering a portfolio of U.S. Treasuries, which are exempt from state income taxes, with bonds maturing at different dates to provide steady income. That product now yields over 4.1%, net of the management fee. Funding: $230 million from Tiger Global Management, Index Ventures and Spark Capital, among others. Latest valuation: $1.4 billion. Date of last valuation: September 2022. Bona fides: Revenue grew 46% in 2024 to $289 million; user base increased to 1.1 million from 750,000. Cofounders: Chairman Andy Rachleff, 66, who also cofounded venture capital firm Benchmark; chief strategy officer Dan Carroll, 43. CEO: David Fortunato, 39, an Amherst College alum who was Wealthfront’s CTO for a decade and took over from Rachleff in 2021. Forbes

Title: Newcomers To The Fintech 50 2025

Stacy Greiner, DailyPay CEO F or private financial technology companies, last year was a quiet one for fundraising. Fintechs raised $34 billion in 2024, down from $42 billion in 2023 and an all-time high of $144 billion in 2021, reports CB Insights. Yet a large group of young companies, some founded as much as a decade ago, started to hit their stride in 2024, showing impressive innovation and fast growth. On our 2025 Fintech 50 list, 18 of the 50 winners had never before made the cut. The Payments category claimed the most first-timers, with six. DailyPay, led by former marketing executive Stacy Greiner, who became CEO last year, lets employees access their wages right after they’ve earned them. The 10-year-old company counts more than 1,000 businesses, including Hilton and Kroger, as customers, and last year it expanded to become available to more than five million employees. San Francisco-based Highnote, another newcomer, makes software that lets businesses issue customizable debit and credit cards, and it more recently launched a product that helps businesses accept online credit and debit payments, putting it in competition with companies like Stripe. It raised $90 million in new funding at a valuation of more than $750 million in January 2025. Squire, a New York company led by former lawyer Songe LaRon, helps barbershops do everything from schedule appointments to accept payments; last year it processed $740 million in transactions, up from $590 million in 2023. In our Business to Business Banking category, which had three-first timers, Arc is a commercial bank specializing in private credit. It has a lending platform that uses AI to convert raw data into credit metrics and provides cash management and treasury products to businesses. In 2024, it processed $4 billion in loan applications and more than doubled its cash management account customers to 2,500. Parafin is a small business lender founded by three former Robinhood data scientists. It uses data from marketplaces like Walmart, DoorDash and Amazon to underwrite loans, instead of relying on credit scores or personal guarantees from the owners. In 2024, Parafin reached 25,000 borrowers, and its revenue more than doubled to $75 million. Our Wall Street and Enterprise category also had three companies making their debut on the Fintech 50. Brico, founded by former consultant and fintech product manager Snigdha Kumar, helps fintechs and other nonbank financial players automate the cumbersome state-by-state licensing process and other regulatory requirements. It has landed customers like card issuer Marqeta and Bilt, a consumer credit card startup that also made its debut on our list this year (in the personal finance category). Another first-timer, fraud prevention firm DataVisor, was cofounded by Chinese immigrants Yinglian Xie and Fang Yu, both with U.S. PhDs in computer science. It uses patented machine learning algorithms to flag fraudulent payments and grew its revenue 67% in 2024, reaching $50 million. Zip makes software that organizes and orchestrates the complex processes of procurement, visualizing the steps necessary for a business to complete a purchase. Just four years after its founding, Zip reached a $2.2 billion valuation last fall, and its customers include OpenAI, Snowflake and Prudential. Real estate was our smallest category on the list this year, with just two companies making the cut overall. Yet even with high interest rates creating a tough environment for real estate, one was a first-timer. Newcomer Aven issues home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that can be tapped via a credit card. With consumers’ homes as collateral, the company’s cards offer a lower interest rate than on normal, unsecured credit cards, while its data and tech shrink the normal HELOC approval time. The billion-dollar company launched in 2020 after CEO Sadi Khan spent 18 months developing the product. It has more than 30,000 customers and hit $200 million in revenue on an annualized basis in 2024. Across all categories, lending businesses seem to be making a comeback from years ago, when they were often maligned by industry investors and CEOs. Among our 18 first-timers, six are lenders, including Arc, Aven, Bilt, Figure, Imprint and Parafin. Headquarters: San Francisco, California. Arc is a neo-commercial bank specializing in private credit and relies on artificial intelligence instead of traditional analysts. It offers two core services: commercial banking, which provides cash management and treasury solutions, and a capital markets platform that uses AI to convert raw data into credit metrics. These metrics are shared with a network of lenders, including private credit funds and banks. With its more efficient, AI-reliant model, Arc charges about 1% for debt offerings, compared to the 3% to 5% charged by traditional banks. In 2024, Arc processed over $4 billion in loan applications; its largest deal was $200 million and average loans were in the tens of millions. Funding: $31 million from Bain Capital Ventures, NFX and Left Lane, among others. Latest valuation: $105 million. Date of last valuation: June 30, 2022. Bona fides: In 2024, it more than doubled its cash management account customers to 2,500. Founders: Don Muir, CEO, 32, a Stanford MBA who started his career at Boston Consulting Group; President Nick Lombardo, 33, a Stanford MBA who worked in investment banking at Credit Suisse before moving into private equity at AEA Investors.

Carlos Domingo, Securitize I n 2024, crypto finally went mainstream. The approval of a dozen spot bitcoin ETFs triggered a flood of institutional capital, transforming what had been a market dominated by retail speculators into one gaining broader acceptance on Wall Street. Then came Donald Trump's election victory, which sent digital assets soaring on hopes that his administration would usher in a golden age for crypto. By December, bitcoin had shattered the $100,000 mark. Trump’s pro-crypto stance became clear early, marked by key appointments and orders: entrepreneur and venture capitalist David Sacks was named AI and Crypto Czar, Scott Bessent took over at Treasury, and former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins was nominated to lead the regulatory agency. Trump also signed an executive order titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” which, among other initiatives, called for the assessment of a “national digital asset stockpile.” In this climate, firms like Figure, Securitize, and Fireblocks thrived, riding some of the industry's most prominent trends. Take tokenized real-world assets (RWAs)—a concept that has evolved from buzzword to billion-dollar business. Case in point: Figure, cofounded by former SoFi CEO Mike Cagney, is applying blockchain technology to traditional lending, having tokenized more than $13 billion in home equity lines of credit. Securitize, meanwhile, partnered with BlackRock to launch BUIDL, a tokenized U.S. treasury product that has already attracted $640 million in investments. Then there’s Fireblocks, a leader in crypto infrastructure. Having secured over $6 trillion in digital asset transactions, the company isn’t slowing down. It recently introduced a state-regulated custody platform and AI-driven trading optimization tools designed to meet the growing needs of institutional clients. Here are the three fintech companies that made the Fintech 50 in 2025: Headquarters: New York, New York.

Title: AI startup Groq once almost ran out of money, so the CEO took a page from World War II fundraising

Time Published: 2025-02-18T05:54:05Z
Full Content:
Semiconductor startup Groq was once so close to going broke that the CEO took inspiration from the US's fundraising during World War II. Jonathan Ross, who founded the company in 2016 with a group of former Google engineers, said that it took seven years to find a product that would sell. When a cash crunch approached, the CEO told his employees, "'We're going to run out of money. We need you to trade salary for equity,'" Ross said in an episode of The Twenty Minute VC podcast uploaded on Monday. He likened the ask to World War II bonds, through which governments asked citizens to help finance their military efforts amid a depressed economy. "We literally took pictures of the war bonds and we put Groq Bonds on it instead," he said. Ross said it was an "intense" decision because people who had left their careers elsewhere and had families were banking on him. He said that they were worried everyone would leave — but 80% of employees participated. The cash compensation reduction helped Groq stay afloat before the startup raised the first portion of a $300 million fundraising round. In 2021, the AI hardware and software company closed a $300 million funding round, co-led by Tiger Global Management and D1 Capital. Last week, Groq inked a deal for $1.5 billion from Saudi Arabia to expand delivery of its advanced AI chips to the Middle Eastern country. In August, the company was valued at $2.8 billion after it raised $640 million from a round led by BlackRock, Cisco Investments, and Samsung Catalyst Fund. Paying employees partially in equity instead of all cash is common for both public and private tech companies. These shares encourage employee retention and serve as a performance incentive. Employees often trade higher cash compensation at established companies for lower cash and equity options at a startup, betting the equity could soar. Early-stage startups sometimes temporarily reduce cash compensation in favor of equity in the company when they are in danger of running out of money. Grok's CEO is one of the few business leaders who has been public about the decision. "If you lean towards that vulnerability, people are often going to go with you," Ross said on Monday about his employees sticking with Groq. Some of the world's largest startups, including OpenAI, Stripe, and SpaceX, have allowed employees to sell their shares through tender offers, letting them cash out even though the company opts to stay private or does not want to be acquired. A tender offer gives employees of private companies a chance to sell a certain number of shares at a fixed price during a limited timeframe. Correction: February 19, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misspelled Groq's name in the eighth paragraph. Jump to

Title: Who Is Driving the Global Privatization of Domestic Infrastructure?

Time Published: 2025-02-18T05:18:53Z
Full Content:
Yves here. I have retitled the post by John Ruehl because I regard the original title, which reflects the positioning of the piece to be misleading. Ruehl, playing on xenophobia, had declared: Foreign Companies Are Driving the Global Privatization of Domestic Infrastructure. In reality, this is pure and simple class warfare. Here, capitalists, mainly in the form of big fund managers and their investors, profit at the expense of the broader citizenry. A popular vote on these matters (with accurate briefs) would almost certainly lead to rejection of the economic proposal, “Sell the family china and rent it back at inflated prices.” Admittedly, Sydney-based Macquarie Bank was a pioneer and early leader in infrastructure finance, which grew out of its expertise in project finance, particularly big mining deals. Macquarie’s initial move to the pole position reflected the fact that infrastructure deals were technically difficult due to the many moving parts and there were less taxing ways in investment banking to make similar amounts of money (another way the pattern of big dogs pursuing easy money is that complex products like mortgage securitizations had disproportionate female representation at high levels of the industry). But as you can see, half of the biggest infrastructure funds are American, including the biggest, a BlackRock entity.,US concerns also represent more than half the funds raised in this top echelon. From Infrastructure Investor 100: Ruehl starts by showcasing the infamous sale of Chicago’s parking meters, a deal we lambasted in detail close to when it was first inked. Ruehl goes though hoops to depict the city as abused by furrniers because it was largely foreign investors who picked up the equity in the deal…after Morgan Stanley, who structured the original deal, defaulted. Ruehl does not understand or acknowledge that the continued extraction from Chicago results from the original, one-sided terms Morgan Stanley got the clueless city to agree to. This blaming foreigners for the very successful and durable predation by Morgan Stanley is seriously off base. Similarly, Ruehl points to the fact that the US is the major market for sale of government owned assets. The US runs chronic trade deficits. That means we import capital. We do that via sales of securities and other assets. If the US was not running such large and persistent trade deficits, we’d have a lot less in the way of this property-hawking (not that we are fans of the Trump tariffs, but indifference to our yawning trade deficits is part of how we wound up here). Ruehl raises the specter of evil funniners using ISDS to enforce their rights. Again, see the Morgan Stanley example. The contracts for infrastructure sales are exceedingly investor-favorable. It is hard to see a scenario where a government entity in the US (where precedents are well-set) could wriggle out of one in US courts. And that’s before getting to the fact that the big private equity and fund management firms are far and away (as a group) the biggest buyers of sophisticated legal services. Not only would it be hard to find a firm with decent expertise that was not conflicted out and/or was unwilling to make it impossible to ever be engaged by the big financiers by opposing them. A government entity suing a general partner is a one off. That also makes it a less attractive legal matter. Moreover, as far as I can tell (again given the pre-existing investor-friendly legal climate in the US), ISDS cases against US government entities are rare (I can’t recall ever hearing of one but knowledgeable readers please pipe up). I suspect to the extent they happen, they relate to state environmental or labor laws. Consistent with that: The United States is the most frequent home state of investors litigating ISDS cases, which have brought 174 cases against other states to date. Finally, Ruehl is unduly concerned with the general partner(s) in these investments and not the limited partners. As with private equity, public pension funds, as in managing money for government employees, are top participants, along with private pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, family offices, and life insurers. Admittedly, Canadian and Australian public pension fund managers were early to this party. But fixating on the national angle obscures the fact that this is yet another facet of how rentiers pinch the public purse. By John P. Ruehl, an Australian-American journalist living in Washington, D.C., and a world affairs correspondent for the Independent Media Institute. He is a contributor to several foreign affairs publications, and his book, Budget Superpower: How Russia Challenges the West With an Economy Smaller Than Texas’, was published in December 2022. Produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute On February 4, 2025, Chicago’s business community pushed back against Mayor Brandon Johnson’s proposal to raise real estate transfer taxes, adding to the city’s ongoing economic struggles. Besides a struggling pension fund, high home prices, and other factors, a significant contributor to the city’s woes lies in the controversial privatization initiatives from the 2000s, known as the “Great Chicago Sell-Off.” Over the past two decades, these decisions have siphoned an estimated $3 to $4 billion from Chicago. The privatization trend began under former Mayor Richard M. Daley, starting with the Chicago Skyway. In 2005, the 7.8-mile toll road was leased to a consortium led by Spain’s Ferrovial and Australia’s Macquarie Group for $1.83 billion. Tolls were raised immediately, and in 2016, the 99-year lease was sold to “a trio of Canadian pension funds” (the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS), the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (OTPP)) for $2.8 billion. Australia’s Atlas Arteria Ltd. then acquired a two-thirds stake for $2 billion in 2022, while OTTP retained the remainder. In 2006, four downtown parking garages with more than 9,000 spaces were leased for 99 years to Morgan Stanley for $563 million. After Morgan Stanley defaulted on its debt tied to the lease agreement, control was transferred in 2014 to lenders, including France’s Societe Generale, the German government, and Italy’s UniCredit S.p.A. In 2016, Australia’s AMP Capital and Canada’s Northleaf Capital Partners acquired the garages. Abu Dhabi came into the picture in 2008. In a $1.16 billion deal, 36,000 parking meters were sold to Chicago Parking Meters (CPM) LLC for 75 years, a consortium led by Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley’s Infrastructure group soon restructured CPM’s ownership, transferring major stakes to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Germany’s Allianz through complex investment vehicles. Over the next five years, parking fees more than doubled. By 2022, CPM recovered its entire $1.16 billion investment, while the city had spent $78.8 million buying back parking spots to cover the revenue it would have generated until 2084. As of 2024, the investment has returned $700 million, with 60 years left on the lease. Daley’s goal was to balance the city’s budget without raising property taxes before leaving office. However, the one-time payments resulted in long-term consequences. In addition to financial losses, the privatization deals have hindered Chicago’s ability to modernize infrastructure by limiting efforts to build bike lanes and reduce car dependence downtown, and people even need to get permission or make payments to companies thousands of miles away for local street parades. Growing Privatization Profit-driven entities argue that privatizing public infrastructure leads to greater efficiency through expertise and investment. However, their focus is on profit maximization, not service improvement, leading to long-term rent-seeking behavior. Furthermore, in contracts with limited liability companies, the government assumes the losses, while private companies reap the profits. Companies can walk away or demand renegotiations, while governments are left to maintain services, absorb long-term revenue losses, and burden the public with higher costs. As Chicago’s experience shows, privatization has extended beyond domestic markets to become an international phenomenon. Starting in the 1980s, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank reforms encouraged the privatization of public infrastructure to attract investment, leading to its internationalization. “A 2006 study by the Norwegian government of IMF conditionality revealed that 23 out of 40 poor countries still have privatization and liberalization conditions attached to their IMF loans,” stated an Oxfam Briefing Paper. By 2000, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and multinational corporations began treating infrastructure as a global asset class, involving extended leases that frequently change hands. Foreign companies operate under bilateral investment treaties or trade agreements, allowing them to bypass local courts. Disputes are often mediated in foreign courts or through international arbitration, such as Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) and the World Trade Organization. By exploiting legal loopholes like offshore subsidiaries and tax havens, companies can also shield profits while facing little public scrutiny. Despite these issues, domestic infrastructure continues to be increasingly available on international markets. United States While Chicago remains the most prominent American example, similar deals are widespread across the country, primarily involving companies from allied or dependent nations. In 1998, Atlanta became one of the first cities to enter into an international privatization deal over public services, signing a 20-year and $428 million contract with United Water, a subsidiary of France’s corporate conglomerate Suez, to operate the city’s water system. Celebrated as the biggest privatization contract in the U.S. at the time, it led to claims of quality decline, delays, and other mismanagement before the contract was terminated, leading to the infrastructure being returned to public control in 2003. Nonetheless, the trend continued. By 2006, foreign companies were leasing and operating 80 percent of U.S. port terminals along with a smaller share of the nation’s airports. The UK’s National Grid owns and operates electric transmission networks in the northeastern U.S. Indiana has since become a prominent example of experimenting with international privatization. France’s Veolia entered a 20-year contract to manage Indianapolis’s waterworks in 2002. The deal was, however, eventually canceled in 2010. Meanwhile, its airport was managed by Britain’s BAA from 1994 to 2007. In 2006, the Indiana Toll Road was leased to a foreign consortium led by Spanish and Australian companies for 75 years for $3.8 billion. It was later sold for $5.7 billion to Australia’s IFM Investors in 2015. United States entities have purchased some infrastructure abroad, such as in 1999, when a subsidiary of Bechtel privatized Cochabamba’s water system in Bolivia before controversy forced its exit. But for a major economy, the U.S. owns surprisingly little foreign infrastructure. It has few state-owned enterprises for overseas infrastructure investment, though some private entities like Blackstone’s Infrastructure Partners division and Corsair Capital are active. Instead, extensive domestic privatization opportunities have made U.S. infrastructure a prime target for American and foreign investors. Canadian and Australian Companies Canadian and Australian pension funds and other entities, driven by well-funded systems, consolidation, government support, and early privatization experience, have become major infrastructure investors in the U.S. and elsewhere. The CPPIB owns toll roads worldwide, the OTPP holds stakes in airports across Europe, along with the Channel Tunnel, while the Canadian company Brookfield Infrastructure Partners owns telecom infrastructure across Europe. Roughly half of Australia’s pension pool is invested outside the country. But Australia’s Macquarie Group, in particular, has seen its assets surge, emerging as the “world’s largest infrastructure asset manager.” Since the 1990s, Macquarie Group has focused on identifying underperforming or undervalued public assets to acquire and restructure, and it established its Global Infrastructure Fund in 2001 “to invest in infrastructure financing opportunities in the U.S., Canada, UK, and the European Union,” according to its website. In addition to Chicago’s Skyway, Macquarie holds long-term operational licenses for the Dulles Greenway toll road in Virginia and the Foley Beach Expressway in Alabama, among others. Macquarie’s toll road portfolio in India is worth an estimated $2 billion, and it took a 49 percent stake in Greece’s largest utility, Public Power Corporation (PPC) in 2021. It also led the push for privatizing the UK’s Bristol Airport in 2001, while Britain’s largest water utility was sold to an international consortium led by Macquarie Group from 2006 to 2017. Macquarie also took full ownership of the UK’s National Gas Network in 2023. According to a July 2023 Guardian article, “Macquarie is well known for taking advantage of volatile markets. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, it bet big on non-investment grade loans, known as junk debt. ​​The debt was cheap, but the quality was decent and the returns turned out to be excellent.” Europe The UK has been a major market for infrastructure investors since the global wave of privatization in the 1980s. Beyond Macquarie’s infrastructure holdings, the UK’s largest electricity generation company was privatized and acquired by France’s EDF in 2009. Foreign investors have continued to diversify, with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) poised to take over Newcastle Airport, after acquiring a 37.6 percent stake in Heathrow with French co-investor Ardian in 2024. Europe’s collective experience with infrastructure privatization has been marked by controversy, largely due to Western European corporate dominance. As the EU expanded, some Western EU companies bought control of critical infrastructure in Eastern EU member states. In 2015, Greece privatized 14 regional airports handing them over to a consortium led by the German company Fraport. This move was unpopular in Greece, especially following the austerity measures imposed by the EU and Germany during Greece’s economic crisis. However, the EU also provides safeguards in such deals, including profit sharing and economic support to member states. Outside the EU, resolving disputes is even more challenging. French water companies like Veolia and Suez are leaders in global privatization efforts but have ended up in court over dealings with Argentina in the 1990s, Egypt in the 2000s, and Gabon in the 2010s. Argentina renationalized its oil company from Spanish company Repsol in 2012 after domestic backlash, damaging relations between the two countries. Such cases can be particularly sensitive when they involve former colonial powers and their former colonies, as economic disputes risk being seen as extensions of past dominance, with former ruling states accused of leveraging privatization to maintain influence. China China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) predominantly focuses on building infrastructure in non-Western countries, though the 2020 takeover of Laos’ electric grid shows an exception. In contrast, Europe’s existing infrastructure has proven attractive for Chinese investment. Greece sold a 51 percent stake in its Piraeus Port Authority in 2016 to China’s COSCO shipping, which later increased to 67 percent in 2021. China’s competitive pricing, substantial financial and productive resources, and strategic interests have extended its infrastructure influence to countries with their own expansive foreign infrastructure portfolios. Chinese firms hold stakes in Belgian, Dutch, German, Spanish, and Italian ports, as well as European energy and telecommunications infrastructure. In Australia, the Port of Darwin was leased for 99 years in 2015 to China’s Landbridge Group, with the Australian government resisting pressure to cancel the deal. The State Grid Corporation of China and its subsidiaries, meanwhile, hold large stakes in Australia’s electricity and gas infrastructure, raising national security concerns due to its close ties to Chinese military and intelligence agencies. Furthermore, China’s control over Australian agricultural land has granted it valuable water rights. The geopolitical implications of these foreign investments in infrastructure are undeniable, with national security concerns forcing China to sell its stake in the U.S. Port of Long Beach in 2019. Yet such investments are only becoming more common globally. While they may strengthen economic ties between countries, they reduce accountability, risk undermining sovereignty, and disconnect public services from local oversight, sidelining effective public planning in favor of enriching foreign entities. This trend appears likely to continue, requiring more responsible approaches to maintaining a healthy balance between the necessity for infrastructure investment and public needs. Shorter contracts, profit-sharing models, and performance-based agreements could help countries and companies showcase their development models and expertise—potentially even at lower costs than local providers. However, profit maximization remains the driving force, particularly when financial entities dominate the field. The question that should always be asked when looking at privatizing infrastructure is “can it be allowed to fail?” If it’s a no, then do not privatize or seek third party private investment. Speaking from the UK, where everything not bolted to the floor has been privatized. Brits forgot their history…: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Riots Our “conservatives” of all political parties appeal to tradition but find it convenient to ignore or forget history. Hello Yves, could you please explain this part “another way the pattern of big dogs pursuing easy money is that complex products like mortgage securitizations had disproportionate female representation at high levels of the industry).” did not quite get it. Thank you Female dominated professions and roles are less well paid and prestigious. This is particularly true in finance. Well, it’s a well known fact, isn’t it, that men go into lucrative professions like male lawyers, male engineers, male doctors, and so forth, whereas women go into less remunerative women’s professions like female lawyers, female engineers, and female doctors? FER SHER! The article is useful if one thinks of the problems of allowing capital to flow freely without regulation — which is more or less what is going on. These unbridled movements of capital are one of the sources of the current assertion of oligarchy in the U S of A. Having lived through the give-away in Chicago, I appreciate Yves Smith’s skepticism up top. The problem was *not* that foreigners and the Spanish peril were swooping in to take Chicago’s assets. The problem was that the entrenched Daley / Obama / Rahm Emanuel Democrats were only too happy to give away pieces of the public sphere. It was / is part of their fantasy of “reinventing” government. At the time of the parking-meter scamola, there was no reason given why the city couldn’t manage its own parking meters. Meanwhile, scads of bucks were / are flowing into Chicago’s swamp of tax-increment finance districts, better known as TIFs and slush funds. Here in Italy, there are plenty of U.S. entities showing up to loot the public space at the invitation of Fratelli d’Italia and the Lega (believe it or not). TIM, the Italian phone company, is now owned by KKR investment bank, although there are rumors of a buyout by an EU company. The Italian government keeps threatening to offer pieces of the FFSS, the Italian state railway system. I can hardly wait for U.S. companies to buy a slice of the FFSS and then offer lessons on how to turn the Italian railway system, which is of the highest quality, into AMTRAK. Yes, this idea that foreigners swooped in is nonsense. As you noted, powers that be were only too happy to sell out, citizens be damned. This from the article was quite the handwave – “…Europe’s existing infrastructure has proven attractive for Chinese investment. Greece sold a 51 percent stake in its Piraeus Port Authority in 2016 to China’s COSCO shipping, which later increased to 67 percent in 2021.” The author fails to mention that it was the European Troika who forced the sale of this public asset as a condition of Greece being bailed out. I don’t remember the exact timeline, but at some point Greece held a referendum on austerity policies and citizens voted ‘no’, only to be overruled by technocrats and have austerity measures imposed on them. Yanis Varoufakis explained that the initial deal was very bad for Greece so the Chinese agreed to renegotiate, giving Greece much better terms. Pretty good rundown of that situation here. I think that the author is on the wrong track here. They are obsessed with all those foreign corporations buying up everything but they should be looking at who is running those corporations and not which countries those corporations come from. On that level, those executives do not really care which passport – or passports – they hold and they have much more in common with executives running other foreign corporations rather than with people from the country that they actually come from. Probably the only time they wave the flag of the country that they come from is to impress the hicks in their home country but truth be told, find it more comfortable mixing with executives from other countries even if they are direct competitors. After all, this is truly their people. All roads lead to Rome, as it were. My evil multinational had a serious slice of shares acquired by both Blackrock and Vanguard over the past few years and now it’s one set of RIFs after another and “AI” pushed like it’s magically going to replace HR, Research, Application Development and of course, Legal, because lawyers have always been the biggest bottleneck to doing business. Like DOGE, I see this as a current of immature thinking about superstructure and systems. When it all breaks down, I guess there will be no further bottlenecks to business doing whatever the heck it wants. So long as they’ve got the bagmen and enforcers to keep the princes in line. Thank you, Yves. I recognise the first five and BlackStone from workshops with Labour in opposition. Labour has prioritised these giants in government, much to the private chagrin of UK investors, but no one dares complain in public. US firms pay better than peers from elsewhere. In addition and on current polling, Labour is unlikely to form the next government, so Labour politicians and even officials in Whitehall are prioritising their nest eggs after 2029. It feels terminal in Blighty, so one may as well sell everything to Wall Street. Plus, when BlackRock visits Downing Street, Angela Rayner can get handsy with Larry Fink. The NC community can read these and weep for Blighty: https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2025/02/18/treasury-incompetence/ and https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2025/02/18/streeting-rotten-to-the-core/. Not unrelated: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/defence-secretarys-speech-on-defence-reform–2. What is it about these politicians, many of whom have not “worked” outside politics, but think the government is a business? Pat McFadden is another. The biggest con in so called privatization deals is the chronic lie that private investors will bring in all sorts of new investment funds and drive efficiency in whatever is being sold off. This is all aided and abetted by the mainstream economics professions which chronically fails to even apply its own basic and foundational principles to properly critique these situations. The driver of this is that mainstream economics has long since abandon the discussion of monopolies or monopoly economics. You see in micro economics 101 we all learn that in a competitive market, price is where the demand curve and the supply curve meet. However, if you venture further up the ladder of economic theory you will learn that the supply curve discussed in econ 101 is the upward sloping portion of a firms marginal cost curve. Here’s where the problem is… every economic study that has tried to understand what the real world shape of real world businesses marginal cost curves are keeps coming back with the same answer… only a small minority of entities actually have a business where their margin costs are rising as output increases. The majority of businesses face a downward sloping margin cost curve. Conveniently the majority of mainstream economics just keeps on ignoring this even though in that same econ 101 class there is probably at least a brief discussion about firms that do face downward sloping marginal cost curves. They are called natural monopolies. The real-world implication of this is that most businesses will act like a real monopoly if they are allowed to. So it should be no surprise to anyone (including economists who shamefully ignore this reality) that when you privatize what is invariably a fairly large entity with few, if any competitors, that they maximize their rent extractions at the expense of their customers and even the business they are supposed to be running. The biggest con in so called privatization deals is the chronic lie that private investors will bring in all sorts of new investment funds and drive efficiency in whatever is being sold off. It’s never better, is it? You and I understand ‘efficiency’ in terms of how well our tools work, how far our car drives per tank. That’s the wrong meaning of the word; when a capitalist says ‘efficiency’, the only thing meant is more profit per $ of revenue, so anything that cuts cost is by definition ‘efficient’. Hi Yves, In response to your question about ISDS cases against the US, they did happen under NAFTA Chapter 11, but never succeeded, which is probably why you never heard about them. Some of the bigger ones (Methanex, 1999, brought against California for phasing out the gasoline additive MTBE, and Glamis Gold, 2003, also brought against California, this time for a law requiring restoration of open-pit mines) related to state environmental laws, as you suggested. A number of them concerned the softwood lumber disputes and were terminated with the new softwood lumber agreement in 2006. By contrast, as of 2018 (before the renegotiation of NAFTA under Trump), Canada had lost 8 cases and Mexico 5. Many of the ISDS provisions under Chapter 11 were removed from the USMCA, which was a win for Canada and Mexico. Sacramento did a similar sell off of parking meter & garages 10ish years ago then used the money to build a new downtown arena for the NBA franchise. Bonus! The City owns the stadium, so the NBA team can threaten to move and extort even more money from the City–or leave it with a money-losing white elephant. The Oakland Raiders did this in Oakland, Anaheim, Oakland again and now Las Vegas. George W. Bush practiced something similar in Arlington, TX, persuading the public to fund a stadium for the (money losing) MLB Texas Rangers. W. then sold his stake in the team (which he purchased with borrowed money), and that sale accounts for 75% of his net worth. Sacramento has a large and growing homeless population, but while it can afford a quarter-billion-dollar stadium, somehow help for the homeless is just too darn expensive.

One, it will lower the exports of its trade partners as local production rises, but India is unlikely to be impacted materially because only ~2% of its total finished steel exports in the first 9 months of this fiscal were to the US. Two, there will be a diversion of exporter inventory to other importer-nations at aggressive prices, especially in a milieu of increasing global competition. This could bring down the prices of steel in India, already trending at 4-year lows, further. That means the Indian government may have to step in with safeguard duty to support domestic capacities. The timing and quantum of this will be crucial. Three, incremental production by US mills will mean a reduction in the steel scrap available for exports. That is because, as much as ~70% of the steel industry there uses the electric arc furnace process, which typically involves converting scrap to produce steel.

WhatsApp Image 2025-02-18 at 12.04.29.jpeg Stocks advanced on BSE at 12 noon on Feb 18, 2025, were 853 against 2,918 stocks that declined, and 131 remained unchanged. Total stocks traded were 3,902. The number of stocks that recorded a 52-week high was 43, and those that hit a 52-week low was 616. A total of 95 stocks traded in the upper circuit, and 421 in the lower circuit. Despite Gift Nifty signaling a positive start, our markets opened the week on a negative note. In the initial hours, Nifty slipped below the recent lows of 22800 but found support, preventing further selling pressure. Gradually, the index recovered throughout the session and ended near the high point, gaining 0.13% to close a tad above the 22950 mark. After an eight-day losing streak, Nifty finally posted gains, reaffirming strong support around 22800. From a technical standpoint, early signs of a potential double-bottom formation on the daily chart suggest a solid base at this level. We have been tracking a Falling Wedge pattern connecting the major lows of August and November. However, a closer look at recent price action reveals another Falling Wedge on a shorter timeframe, linking the lows of November and January. Looking ahead, strong support is evident at every 100-point interval, ranging from 22800–22700 (lower end of the wedge) to 22600–22500, which coincides with the 127% retracement of the early February rebound. Additionally, a two-point positive divergence on the RSI Smoothened suggests a potential shift towards positivity. Given these factors, we do not anticipate significant downside risks, and the bulls may attempt a recovery in the near term. Therefore, we advise traders to avoid panic selling and refrain from initiating fresh short positions. Instead, any dips can be viewed as opportunities to accumulate quality names in a staggered manner. That said, while we don’t want to sound too gung-ho, we prefer to take one step at a time. Immediate resistance is placed at 23250, aligning with the 20-day EMA and the intraday high on the hourly chart, while the upper boundary of the Falling Wedge near 23400 remains a critical hurdle. Traders should closely monitor these levels and plan their trades accordingly. · Pace of expansion may remain below Q1 FY2025 levels, led by industry · Rise in GDP to continue to trail GVA growth for the third quarter in a row ICRA has projected the year-on-year (YoY) expansion of the GDP to rise to 6.4% in Q3 FY2025 from the seven-quarter low of 5.4% in Q2 FY2025, benefitting from enhanced Government spending amid uneven consumption. Further, the growth in the gross value added (GVA) is estimated to record a relatively broad-based improvement to 6.6% in Q3 FY2025 from 5.6% in Q2 FY2025, driven by the industrial (to +6.2% from +3.6%), services (to +7.7% from +7.1%), and agricultural (to +4.0% from +3.5%) sectors. On a sombre note, the GDP and GVA growth in Q3 FY2025 is foreseen to continue to trail the NSO’s initial growth estimates for Q1 FY2025 (+6.7% and +6.8%, respectively), which had seen some sectors affected by the Parliamentary elections, the Model Code of Conduct, and also the heat wave in some states. ICRA estimates that the growth in net indirect taxes (in nominal terms) eased significantly to low single digits in the quarter from 7.9% in Q2 FY2025, owing to a sharp, albeit base effect-led rise in the YoY increase in subsidy disbursement by the Centre (to +31.1% in Q3 FY2025 from +4.3% in Q2 FY2025; -53.6% in Q3 FY2024; -7.6% in Q2 FY2024). As a result, the GDP expansion would continue to trail that in the GVA in Q3 FY2025 for the third quarter in a row, with a similar trend expected in the full year as well. Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, Head-Research & Outreach, ICRA said: “India’s economic performance in Q3 FY2025 benefitted from a sharp ramp-up in aggregate Government spending (Centre + state) on capital and revenue expenditure, high growth in services exports, a turnaround in merchandise exports, healthy output of major kharif crops etc., which would have buffered rural sentiment. Some consumer-focussed sectors saw a pick-up during the festive season, even as urban consumer sentiment dipped slightly, and other sectors such as mining and electricity saw an improvement after weather-related challenges in the previous quarter. Overall, while we expect the pace of GDP and the GVA expansion to rise in Q3 FY2025 relative to the seven-quarter low prints for the previous quarter, marking an upturn, the performance may remain inferior to the NSO’s initial estimates for Q1 FY2025.” Zen Technologies stock plunges 10% on Q3 results, despite buy calls, as company faces growth concerns and order delays. 360 ONE Asset acquires 15% stake in Bharti AXA Life Insurance, enhancing growth, innovation, and market presence in India.

This is due to the economic uncertainty looming in the market on the back of tariff threats by Donald Trump right after his arrival in the power again. The overall imports of Gems & Jewellery for January 2025 stood at USD 1421.61 million (Rs. 12269.41 crore) showing a decline of 37.83% as compared to USD 2286.55 million (Rs. 19008.4 crore) for the same period last year. While there may be multiple factors like loosened demand due to end of wedding season, this also indicates the strengthening aatmanirbharta of Indian Gems & Jewellery sector where the domestic demand is met by domestic jewellery manufacturers, thus having less to no reliance on international players for finished jewellery products. Commenting on the same, Colin Shah, MD, Kama Jewelry said, “With Trump coming back into power and aggressively pushing massive tariff hikes, the impact of the same is evidently visible on overall global trade activities. We are in a wait-and-watch situation to monitor Trump’s tariff stance, which will decide how the global market will navigate through these times. However, a gradual rebound in trade activities could be seen in the upcoming months once there is absolute clarity.” Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE). Slow going and going slowly We do not find much value in most parts of the market despite the recent sharp correction in the market. The Indian market may stay lackluster, weighed down by (1) rich valuations across sectors and stocks, (2) potential earnings downgrades and (3) higher-for-longer global interest rates. The 3QFY25 results season did little to change our cautious view of the market. Not much value as yet despite sharp correction in parts of the market We do not find much value in most parts of the market despite the sharp correction in several sectors and stocks in the past few months. Most sectors and stocks are still trading at rich valuations, with the extent of overvaluation rising in inverse correlation to market capitalization, quality and risk. FPIs may not return in a hurry; DIIs are buying in a hurry The battle between FPIs and DIIs will likely continue in the next few months, with (1) FPIs likely to continue with their cautious stance, given a challenging global investment environment for EMs and (2) DIIs likely to deploy aggressively, given (1) high cash positions with MFs and (2) possibly strong (though tapering) inflows from retail investors. However, a period of low trailing returns could dampen return expectations among retail investors and inflows into domestic mutual funds. The 12-month return of the NSE-50 Index, the Nifty Midcap 100 Index and the Nifty 100 Smallcap 100 Index has come down to 5%, 3% and (-)3% with negative returns of 5%, 12% and 15% in the past six months. Challenges emerging in both macro and micro India’s macroeconomic position has deteriorated somewhat in the past few months, with (1) a continued slowdown in consumption demand (especially of basic staple items), reflecting the income and inflation challenges for the low-income households, (2) a likely slowdown in government capex (one of the drivers of the economy until recently) and (3) increased pressure on the external position (low BoP surplus, a sharp decline in FX reserves and a weakening INR). 3QFY25 results and management commentary showed (1) a modest deterioration in the asset quality of banks, led by the MFI book of small finance banks and MFI-NBFCs, (2) continued weakness in consumption demand despite some recovery in rural demand, but (3) strong momentum in investment. 3QFY25 results weak in general; misses punished 3QFY25 net income of the Nifty-50 Index grew 8.8%, moderately ahead of our expectation of 7.8% growth, and 3QFY25 net income of the KIE coverage universe grew 8.2%, moderately below our expectation of a 9.2% increase. 3QFY25 EBITDA of the Nifty-50 Index increased 6.7% versus our expectation of 5.1% growth. The weak 3QFY25 operating results again highlighted some of our long-standing concerns around (1) the Street’s optimistic profitability and volume assumptions and (2) disruption threats across sectors India’s sugar output is expected to fall to 26 million tons this season due to disease affecting the cane crop in Uttar Pradesh. Sugar production is expected to rebound next season, but supplies will remain tight in the near term due to lower output in Thailand and other countries. Tight refined sugar supplies will boost white sugar’s premium over raw sugar, with world sugar prices needing to stay above $530 a ton to incentivize exports.

The market construct doesn’t favour a rally in the market. FIIs are likely to continue to sell. News flows are not positive. The US market continues to be strong and may attract more capital flows to the US from other markets. A new development is from the Chinese authorities indicating a new perspective regarding the Chinese government’s approach to Chinese businesses. President Xi has indicated the need for a “clean relationship” between government and business. This is regarded as a favourable development for reviving the Chinese economy, which is struggling now from the fall out of the crisis in the real estate sector. If the Chinese government’s new initiatives attract positive responses from the FIIs, that means more bad news for Indian markets. More money will flow into Chinese stocks through the Hang Seng exchange since the PE of the Hang Seng index is only around 12 compared to the 18.5 one-year forward PE in India. Since largecaps are fairly valued in India, calibrated buying in this segment can be done. But the market construct doesn’t favour aggressive buying.” Gold imports in January surged 40.79% to $2.68 billion due to rising domestic demand, says the commerce ministry Tesla Inc. plans to enter the Indian market, hiring for various roles after CEO Elon Musk met with Prime Minister Modi. Nifty-50 reported 5% YoY PAT growth, aligning with expectations but significantly weaker than the 20%+ CAGR seen between FY20-24. The slowdown in earnings momentum, coupled with increased market volatility and sector-specific challenges, has led to a more cautious investment outlook. BFSI, Healthcare, and Capital Goods Drive Stability BFSI led the earnings cycle, growing 11% YoY, with PSU banks (+24% YoY) outpacing private lenders due to lower credit costs and better asset quality. Healthcare posted 25% YoY growth, driven by chronic therapies and strong US generics demand. The Capital Goods sector expanded earnings by 20% YoY, benefitting from strong order inflows and continued government infrastructure spending. Technology (+9% YoY) remained resilient, though margin pressures persisted. Cyclicals and Consumer-Oriented Sectors Underperform Oil & Gas earnings declined 11% YoY, impacted by weak refining margins and crude price fluctuations. Cement had a difficult quarter (-55% YoY) as pricing pressures and cost inflation hurt profitability. Chemicals saw a 12% YoY earnings drop, affected by weak export demand and price corrections. Consumer and auto segments struggled with rural demand weakness, margin compression, and a cautious FY26 outlook. Key Sectoral Review – Diverging Performance Across Industries The sectoral performance in 3QFY25 was highly uneven, with some industries benefitting from strong structural tailwinds, while others struggled with demand contraction and cost pressures. Despite overall market weakness, select sectors like BFSI, Healthcare, Capital Goods, and Telecom posted resilient growth, whereas Cement, Oil & Gas, and Consumer Discretionary lagged behind. Sectoral Performance: Strength in BFSI, Healthcare & Infra BFSI continued to lead the recovery, with PSU banks benefitting from strong loan growth and lower credit costs. The Healthcare sector (+25% YoY) capitalised on steady demand for chronic medicines and an expanding generics market in the US. Capital Goods and Infrastructure remained strong (+20% YoY), supported by government-led capex and high order inflows. The Telecom sector also returned to profitability, driven by tariff hikes and subscriber growth. Cement, Oil & Gas, and Consumption Lag Behind Cement earnings plunged 55% YoY, impacted by weak pricing trends and cost inflation. Oil & Gas declined 11% YoY, with lower refining margins weighing on profitability. The Chemicals sector saw a 12% YoY decline, struggling with weak global demand and oversupply issues. Meanwhile, Consumer and Auto sectors continued to underperform, with subdued rural demand and margin pressures leading to muted growth expectations for FY26. Market Valuations Remain Elevated Despite weak earnings momentum, valuations remain stretched, with two-thirds of sectors still trading above their historical averages. The Nifty’s P/E ratio stands at 19.9x, marginally below its long-term average, while the P/B ratio at 3.1x reflects an 11% premium, suggesting limited upside without a strong earnings recovery. Our View: Navigating a Market at Crossroads: With the earnings downgrade cycle intensifying and macro uncertainties persisting, a selective investment strategy is imperative. The market is facing high valuations, slowing earnings growth, and volatility across key sectors, requiring a disciplined and resilient approach to portfolio construction. South Korea plans a record $249 billion trade policy financing to support exporters, reinforcing its commitment to strengthening global trade. China’s January bank lending hit a record high due to policy stimulus, while its tech sector is booming, reflecting strong innovation growth. The country is also strengthening strategic resource partnerships, with Congo emerging as a key supplier of copper. Japan’s GDP grew at an annualized 2.8% in Q4, exceeding forecasts due to strong consumption and business spending. The government has approved new climate, energy, and industry policies through 2040 to ensure long-term sustainability. Japan’s DBJ has also partnered with Indonesia’s INA to launch a hybrid fund for mid-sized businesses. India aims to boost trade with the US while balancing its tariff reactions. The country’s January trade deficit aligned with expectations, and the rupee is expected to take cues from dollar movements, while bond markets focus on liquidity changes. Indonesia recorded a trade surplus of $3.45 billion in January, primarily driven by weak imports. The country’s parliament is set to vote on mining law amendments, which could significantly impact its resource exports. Hong Kong regulators have hinted at allowing cryptocurrencies as proof of wealth, signaling a shift toward digital asset adoption. In Singapore, January exports fell 2.1% year-on-year, weaker than forecast, indicating external trade weakness. The UK is facing business concerns over impending tax hikes, while the housing market is beginning to slow due to recent tax policy changes. The Bank of England sees inflation slowing, though a temporary jump is expected in 2025. European shares have hit record highs, driven by optimism over potential peace developments in Ukraine. However, security demands continue to strain European finances, and German cities are struggling with rising costs amid a weak economy.

Aditya Gaggar, Director of Progressive Shares After significant fluctuations, the Index settled higher at 22,960, successfully defending the 22,800 level for the third time in recent weeks, reinforcing it as a strong support. On the upside, the 23,100 level remains a key immediate resistance, and a breakout in either direction is crucial for establishing a clear market trend. Similarly, BankNifty has defended its support at 48,750 and reversed, with resistance at 49,750 still intact. From a sectoral perspective, most sectors have formed neutral to positive candles, suggesting a potential trend reversal. A close above the previous day’s high would provide confirmation of this shift. This outlook is also reflected in the Midcap and Smallcap segments, where a break above key resistance levels could signal further upside potential. Overall, the market is at a critical juncture, with a breakout or breakdown from these levels likely to define the next phase of the trend. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd. GIFT Nifty is trading sideways this Tuesday morning after Nifty snapped an 8-day losing streak and closed in positive territory yesterday. The focus is on Wednesday’s FOMC minutes, expected to reveal a hawkish Federal Reserve, lowering hopes for rate cuts in 2025. Positive catalysts include Russia-Ukraine peace prospects, falling oil prices, a weaker US Dollar, and RBI’s rate cuts. However, FIIs remain net sellers, with Rs 1,20,494 crore withdrawn so far this year. Technically, Nifty’s strength is seen above 24054, with a bullish outlook on HINDALCO, CIPLA, and VOLTAS for short-term gains. * DEEPAKNTR * MANAPPURAM JPMorgan on Persistent: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 7200/Sh (Positive) MS on Shree Cement: Upgrade to Equal weight on Company, raise target price at Rs 26950/Sh (Positive) Citi on Shriram Fin: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 720/Sh (Positive) Citi on Maruti: Maintain Buy on Company, raise target price at Rs 14500/Sh (Positive) MS on Ultratech Cement: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 13650/Sh (Positive) UBS on Max Health: Upgrade to Buy on Company, raise target price at Rs 1200/Sh (Positive) CLSA on Tech Mah: Maintain Outperform on Company, target price at Rs 2030/Sh (Positive) MS on Deepak NTR: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 3000/Sh (Positive) MS on Ambuja: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 590/Sh (Neutral) UBS on PCBL: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 600/Sh (Positive) MS on Indian Markets: Buying Indian equities could prove rewarding, India should resume its outperformance to EM in the comingmonths.

(Negative) Karnataka Bank: Identifies certain deficiencies in reconciliation process during review of suspicious UPI Global Transactions (Negative) Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Markets When Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with President Donald Trump, in their discussions they pledged to enhance United States and India trade relations, setting an audacious goal of $500 billion by 2030. Their negotiation teams have also been directed to try and achieve a deal by Fall 2025. The terms of this deal are likely to reduce tariffs and other barriers on textiles, electronics, engineering and other industries. Moreover, India also pledged increased energy purchases from the United States, which will increase India’s spending on oil and gas from $15 billion to $25 billion to improve energy brauchen und help resolve trade deficits. President Trump made the announcement of his new “reciprocal” tariff plan, where he applies the same duties onto other high tariff countries. While self benefiting trade practices were set in place, this policy has introduced short term uncertainty into the market. Prime Minister Modi’s visit had included discussions on defense cooperation, including the potential sale of F-35 fighter jets to India. This is part of a wider ten-year defense agreement that intends to improve the military capability of India and its influence on regional security issues. In terms of security and immigration, Trump also supported the extradition of the person responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attacks as a breach of diplomacy to bolster trust from both countries. February 14, 2025 proved to be an eventful day as Modi’s trip.

Prime Focus stock rose 1.07% on the NSE to ₹102.05 The US move to slap a flat 25% tariff on steel imports from March 12, 2025, compared with multiple types of lesser levies previously, will have a three-fold impact. One, it will lower the exports of its trade partners as local production rises, but India is unlikely to be impacted materially because only ~2% of its total finished steel exports in the first 9 months of this fiscal were to the US. Two, there will be a diversion of exporter inventory to other importer-nations at aggressive prices, especially in a milieu of increasing global competition. This could bring down the prices of steel in India, already trending at 4-year lows, further. That means the Indian government may have to step in with safeguard duty to support domestic capacities. The timing and quantum of this will be crucial. Three, incremental production by US mills will mean a reduction in the steel scrap available for exports. That is because, as much as ~70% of the steel industry there uses the electric arc furnace process, which typically involves converting scrap to produce steel. At present, India sources ~14-15% of its scrap requirements from the US.” QMS Medical Allied Services posts 41.8% jump in consolidated PAT in Q3FY25 backed by foray into new business segment and increased share of solution‐focused businesses · Operating income on consolidated basis increased by 24.5% as the company ramped up its share of solution‐focused businesses · EBITDA up by 43.1% at Rs 7.14 crore · Company receives Board approval for rights issue for raising around Rs 49 crore Suraj Estate Developers, a leading real estate construction company in South-Central Mumbai, has announced the launch of ‘The Higher Life Begins, a campaign unveiling ‘The Sky Collection’ at Suraj Vitalis.

Despite Gift Nifty signaling a positive start, our markets opened the week on a negative note. In the initial hours, Nifty slipped below the recent lows of 22800 but found support, preventing further selling pressure. Gradually, the index recovered throughout the session and ended near the high point, gaining 0.13% to close a tad above the 22950 mark. After an eight-day losing streak, Nifty finally posted gains, reaffirming strong support around 22800. From a technical standpoint, early signs of a potential double-bottom formation on the daily chart suggest a solid base at this level. We have been tracking a Falling Wedge pattern connecting the major lows of August and November. However, a closer look at recent price action reveals another Falling Wedge on a shorter timeframe, linking the lows of November and January. Looking ahead, strong support is evident at every 100-point interval, ranging from 22800–22700 (lower end of the wedge) to 22600–22500, which coincides with the 127% retracement of the early February rebound. Additionally, a two-point positive divergence on the RSI Smoothened suggests a potential shift towards positivity. Given these factors, we do not anticipate significant downside risks, and the bulls may attempt a recovery in the near term. Therefore, we advise traders to avoid panic selling and refrain from initiating fresh short positions. Instead, any dips can be viewed as opportunities to accumulate quality names in a staggered manner. That said, while we don’t want to sound too gung-ho, we prefer to take one step at a time. Immediate resistance is placed at 23250, aligning with the 20-day EMA and the intraday high on the hourly chart, while the upper boundary of the Falling Wedge near 23400 remains a critical hurdle. Traders should closely monitor these levels and plan their trades accordingly. · Pace of expansion may remain below Q1 FY2025 levels, led by industry · Rise in GDP to continue to trail GVA growth for the third quarter in a row ICRA has projected the year-on-year (YoY) expansion of the GDP to rise to 6.4% in Q3 FY2025 from the seven-quarter low of 5.4% in Q2 FY2025, benefitting from enhanced Government spending amid uneven consumption. Further, the growth in the gross value added (GVA) is estimated to record a relatively broad-based improvement to 6.6% in Q3 FY2025 from 5.6% in Q2 FY2025, driven by the industrial (to +6.2% from +3.6%), services (to +7.7% from +7.1%), and agricultural (to +4.0% from +3.5%) sectors. On a sombre note, the GDP and GVA growth in Q3 FY2025 is foreseen to continue to trail the NSO’s initial growth estimates for Q1 FY2025 (+6.7% and +6.8%, respectively), which had seen some sectors affected by the Parliamentary elections, the Model Code of Conduct, and also the heat wave in some states. ICRA estimates that the growth in net indirect taxes (in nominal terms) eased significantly to low single digits in the quarter from 7.9% in Q2 FY2025, owing to a sharp, albeit base effect-led rise in the YoY increase in subsidy disbursement by the Centre (to +31.1% in Q3 FY2025 from +4.3% in Q2 FY2025; -53.6% in Q3 FY2024; -7.6% in Q2 FY2024). As a result, the GDP expansion would continue to trail that in the GVA in Q3 FY2025 for the third quarter in a row, with a similar trend expected in the full year as well. Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, Head-Research & Outreach, ICRA said: “India’s economic performance in Q3 FY2025 benefitted from a sharp ramp-up in aggregate Government spending (Centre + state) on capital and revenue expenditure, high growth in services exports, a turnaround in merchandise exports, healthy output of major kharif crops etc., which would have buffered rural sentiment. Some consumer-focussed sectors saw a pick-up during the festive season, even as urban consumer sentiment dipped slightly, and other sectors such as mining and electricity saw an improvement after weather-related challenges in the previous quarter. Overall, while we expect the pace of GDP and the GVA expansion to rise in Q3 FY2025 relative to the seven-quarter low prints for the previous quarter, marking an upturn, the performance may remain inferior to the NSO’s initial estimates for Q1 FY2025.” Zen Technologies stock plunges 10% on Q3 results, despite buy calls, as company faces growth concerns and order delays. 360 ONE Asset acquires 15% stake in Bharti AXA Life Insurance, enhancing growth, innovation, and market presence in India.

This is due to the economic uncertainty looming in the market on the back of tariff threats by Donald Trump right after his arrival in the power again. The overall imports of Gems & Jewellery for January 2025 stood at USD 1421.61 million (Rs. 12269.41 crore) showing a decline of 37.83% as compared to USD 2286.55 million (Rs. 19008.4 crore) for the same period last year. While there may be multiple factors like loosened demand due to end of wedding season, this also indicates the strengthening aatmanirbharta of Indian Gems & Jewellery sector where the domestic demand is met by domestic jewellery manufacturers, thus having less to no reliance on international players for finished jewellery products. Commenting on the same, Colin Shah, MD, Kama Jewelry said, “With Trump coming back into power and aggressively pushing massive tariff hikes, the impact of the same is evidently visible on overall global trade activities. We are in a wait-and-watch situation to monitor Trump’s tariff stance, which will decide how the global market will navigate through these times. However, a gradual rebound in trade activities could be seen in the upcoming months once there is absolute clarity.” Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE). Slow going and going slowly We do not find much value in most parts of the market despite the recent sharp correction in the market. The Indian market may stay lackluster, weighed down by (1) rich valuations across sectors and stocks, (2) potential earnings downgrades and (3) higher-for-longer global interest rates. The 3QFY25 results season did little to change our cautious view of the market. Not much value as yet despite sharp correction in parts of the market We do not find much value in most parts of the market despite the sharp correction in several sectors and stocks in the past few months. Most sectors and stocks are still trading at rich valuations, with the extent of overvaluation rising in inverse correlation to market capitalization, quality and risk. FPIs may not return in a hurry; DIIs are buying in a hurry The battle between FPIs and DIIs will likely continue in the next few months, with (1) FPIs likely to continue with their cautious stance, given a challenging global investment environment for EMs and (2) DIIs likely to deploy aggressively, given (1) high cash positions with MFs and (2) possibly strong (though tapering) inflows from retail investors. However, a period of low trailing returns could dampen return expectations among retail investors and inflows into domestic mutual funds. The 12-month return of the NSE-50 Index, the Nifty Midcap 100 Index and the Nifty 100 Smallcap 100 Index has come down to 5%, 3% and (-)3% with negative returns of 5%, 12% and 15% in the past six months. Challenges emerging in both macro and micro India’s macroeconomic position has deteriorated somewhat in the past few months, with (1) a continued slowdown in consumption demand (especially of basic staple items), reflecting the income and inflation challenges for the low-income households, (2) a likely slowdown in government capex (one of the drivers of the economy until recently) and (3) increased pressure on the external position (low BoP surplus, a sharp decline in FX reserves and a weakening INR). 3QFY25 results and management commentary showed (1) a modest deterioration in the asset quality of banks, led by the MFI book of small finance banks and MFI-NBFCs, (2) continued weakness in consumption demand despite some recovery in rural demand, but (3) strong momentum in investment. 3QFY25 results weak in general; misses punished 3QFY25 net income of the Nifty-50 Index grew 8.8%, moderately ahead of our expectation of 7.8% growth, and 3QFY25 net income of the KIE coverage universe grew 8.2%, moderately below our expectation of a 9.2% increase. 3QFY25 EBITDA of the Nifty-50 Index increased 6.7% versus our expectation of 5.1% growth. The weak 3QFY25 operating results again highlighted some of our long-standing concerns around (1) the Street’s optimistic profitability and volume assumptions and (2) disruption threats across sectors India’s sugar output is expected to fall to 26 million tons this season due to disease affecting the cane crop in Uttar Pradesh. Sugar production is expected to rebound next season, but supplies will remain tight in the near term due to lower output in Thailand and other countries. Tight refined sugar supplies will boost white sugar’s premium over raw sugar, with world sugar prices needing to stay above $530 a ton to incentivize exports.

The market construct doesn’t favour a rally in the market. FIIs are likely to continue to sell. News flows are not positive. The US market continues to be strong and may attract more capital flows to the US from other markets. A new development is from the Chinese authorities indicating a new perspective regarding the Chinese government’s approach to Chinese businesses. President Xi has indicated the need for a “clean relationship” between government and business. This is regarded as a favourable development for reviving the Chinese economy, which is struggling now from the fall out of the crisis in the real estate sector. If the Chinese government’s new initiatives attract positive responses from the FIIs, that means more bad news for Indian markets. More money will flow into Chinese stocks through the Hang Seng exchange since the PE of the Hang Seng index is only around 12 compared to the 18.5 one-year forward PE in India. Since largecaps are fairly valued in India, calibrated buying in this segment can be done. But the market construct doesn’t favour aggressive buying.” Gold imports in January surged 40.79% to $2.68 billion due to rising domestic demand, says the commerce ministry Tesla Inc. plans to enter the Indian market, hiring for various roles after CEO Elon Musk met with Prime Minister Modi. Nifty-50 reported 5% YoY PAT growth, aligning with expectations but significantly weaker than the 20%+ CAGR seen between FY20-24. The slowdown in earnings momentum, coupled with increased market volatility and sector-specific challenges, has led to a more cautious investment outlook. BFSI, Healthcare, and Capital Goods Drive Stability BFSI led the earnings cycle, growing 11% YoY, with PSU banks (+24% YoY) outpacing private lenders due to lower credit costs and better asset quality. Healthcare posted 25% YoY growth, driven by chronic therapies and strong US generics demand. The Capital Goods sector expanded earnings by 20% YoY, benefitting from strong order inflows and continued government infrastructure spending. Technology (+9% YoY) remained resilient, though margin pressures persisted. Cyclicals and Consumer-Oriented Sectors Underperform Oil & Gas earnings declined 11% YoY, impacted by weak refining margins and crude price fluctuations. Cement had a difficult quarter (-55% YoY) as pricing pressures and cost inflation hurt profitability. Chemicals saw a 12% YoY earnings drop, affected by weak export demand and price corrections. Consumer and auto segments struggled with rural demand weakness, margin compression, and a cautious FY26 outlook. Key Sectoral Review – Diverging Performance Across Industries The sectoral performance in 3QFY25 was highly uneven, with some industries benefitting from strong structural tailwinds, while others struggled with demand contraction and cost pressures. Despite overall market weakness, select sectors like BFSI, Healthcare, Capital Goods, and Telecom posted resilient growth, whereas Cement, Oil & Gas, and Consumer Discretionary lagged behind. Sectoral Performance: Strength in BFSI, Healthcare & Infra BFSI continued to lead the recovery, with PSU banks benefitting from strong loan growth and lower credit costs. The Healthcare sector (+25% YoY) capitalised on steady demand for chronic medicines and an expanding generics market in the US. Capital Goods and Infrastructure remained strong (+20% YoY), supported by government-led capex and high order inflows. The Telecom sector also returned to profitability, driven by tariff hikes and subscriber growth. Cement, Oil & Gas, and Consumption Lag Behind Cement earnings plunged 55% YoY, impacted by weak pricing trends and cost inflation. Oil & Gas declined 11% YoY, with lower refining margins weighing on profitability. The Chemicals sector saw a 12% YoY decline, struggling with weak global demand and oversupply issues. Meanwhile, Consumer and Auto sectors continued to underperform, with subdued rural demand and margin pressures leading to muted growth expectations for FY26. Market Valuations Remain Elevated Despite weak earnings momentum, valuations remain stretched, with two-thirds of sectors still trading above their historical averages. The Nifty’s P/E ratio stands at 19.9x, marginally below its long-term average, while the P/B ratio at 3.1x reflects an 11% premium, suggesting limited upside without a strong earnings recovery. Our View: Navigating a Market at Crossroads: With the earnings downgrade cycle intensifying and macro uncertainties persisting, a selective investment strategy is imperative. The market is facing high valuations, slowing earnings growth, and volatility across key sectors, requiring a disciplined and resilient approach to portfolio construction. South Korea plans a record $249 billion trade policy financing to support exporters, reinforcing its commitment to strengthening global trade. China’s January bank lending hit a record high due to policy stimulus, while its tech sector is booming, reflecting strong innovation growth. The country is also strengthening strategic resource partnerships, with Congo emerging as a key supplier of copper. Japan’s GDP grew at an annualized 2.8% in Q4, exceeding forecasts due to strong consumption and business spending. The government has approved new climate, energy, and industry policies through 2040 to ensure long-term sustainability. Japan’s DBJ has also partnered with Indonesia’s INA to launch a hybrid fund for mid-sized businesses. India aims to boost trade with the US while balancing its tariff reactions. The country’s January trade deficit aligned with expectations, and the rupee is expected to take cues from dollar movements, while bond markets focus on liquidity changes. Indonesia recorded a trade surplus of $3.45 billion in January, primarily driven by weak imports. The country’s parliament is set to vote on mining law amendments, which could significantly impact its resource exports. Hong Kong regulators have hinted at allowing cryptocurrencies as proof of wealth, signaling a shift toward digital asset adoption. In Singapore, January exports fell 2.1% year-on-year, weaker than forecast, indicating external trade weakness. The UK is facing business concerns over impending tax hikes, while the housing market is beginning to slow due to recent tax policy changes. The Bank of England sees inflation slowing, though a temporary jump is expected in 2025. European shares have hit record highs, driven by optimism over potential peace developments in Ukraine. However, security demands continue to strain European finances, and German cities are struggling with rising costs amid a weak economy. In the US, Federal Reserve official Christopher Waller has warned against allowing policy uncertainty to paralyze rate decisions, indicating a proactive approach. Commodity markets are experiencing shifts as speculators reduce long positions in corn and soybeans. Meanwhile, BHP sees signs of economic recovery in China but remains cautious about potential trade tensions.

Aditya Gaggar, Director of Progressive Shares After significant fluctuations, the Index settled higher at 22,960, successfully defending the 22,800 level for the third time in recent weeks, reinforcing it as a strong support. On the upside, the 23,100 level remains a key immediate resistance, and a breakout in either direction is crucial for establishing a clear market trend. Similarly, BankNifty has defended its support at 48,750 and reversed, with resistance at 49,750 still intact. From a sectoral perspective, most sectors have formed neutral to positive candles, suggesting a potential trend reversal. A close above the previous day’s high would provide confirmation of this shift. This outlook is also reflected in the Midcap and Smallcap segments, where a break above key resistance levels could signal further upside potential. Overall, the market is at a critical juncture, with a breakout or breakdown from these levels likely to define the next phase of the trend. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd. GIFT Nifty is trading sideways this Tuesday morning after Nifty snapped an 8-day losing streak and closed in positive territory yesterday. The focus is on Wednesday’s FOMC minutes, expected to reveal a hawkish Federal Reserve, lowering hopes for rate cuts in 2025. Positive catalysts include Russia-Ukraine peace prospects, falling oil prices, a weaker US Dollar, and RBI’s rate cuts. However, FIIs remain net sellers, with Rs 1,20,494 crore withdrawn so far this year. Technically, Nifty’s strength is seen above 24054, with a bullish outlook on HINDALCO, CIPLA, and VOLTAS for short-term gains. * DEEPAKNTR * MANAPPURAM JPMorgan on Persistent: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 7200/Sh (Positive) MS on Shree Cement: Upgrade to Equal weight on Company, raise target price at Rs 26950/Sh (Positive) Citi on Shriram Fin: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 720/Sh (Positive) Citi on Maruti: Maintain Buy on Company, raise target price at Rs 14500/Sh (Positive) MS on Ultratech Cement: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 13650/Sh (Positive) UBS on Max Health: Upgrade to Buy on Company, raise target price at Rs 1200/Sh (Positive) CLSA on Tech Mah: Maintain Outperform on Company, target price at Rs 2030/Sh (Positive) MS on Deepak NTR: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 3000/Sh (Positive) MS on Ambuja: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 590/Sh (Neutral) UBS on PCBL: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 600/Sh (Positive) MS on Indian Markets: Buying Indian equities could prove rewarding, India should resume its outperformance to EM in the comingmonths.

Their negotiation teams have also been directed to try and achieve a deal by Fall 2025. The terms of this deal are likely to reduce tariffs and other barriers on textiles, electronics, engineering and other industries. Moreover, India also pledged increased energy purchases from the United States, which will increase India’s spending on oil and gas from $15 billion to $25 billion to improve energy brauchen und help resolve trade deficits. President Trump made the announcement of his new “reciprocal” tariff plan, where he applies the same duties onto other high tariff countries. While self benefiting trade practices were set in place, this policy has introduced short term uncertainty into the market. Prime Minister Modi’s visit had included discussions on defense cooperation, including the potential sale of F-35 fighter jets to India. This is part of a wider ten-year defense agreement that intends to improve the military capability of India and its influence on regional security issues. In terms of security and immigration, Trump also supported the extradition of the person responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attacks as a breach of diplomacy to bolster trust from both countries.

February 17, 2025 19:37 ET | Source: Flary Finance Flary Finance Photo courtesy of Flary Finance ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates, Feb. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Following Donald Trump’s victory and his administration’s commitment to pro-crypto policies, investors are seeing growth and new opportunities in digital assets. Adding to the momentum, financial titan BlackRock has begun significant investments into crypto-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs), signaling strong potential in the future of digital currencies. While investors are flocking back to top assets, a new player offers substantial potential—Flary Finance.

The result is a carefully crafted outlook on liquidity distribution across multiple blockchains that solves common pain points. It offers fresh solutions to enhance user experience that are accessible to all.

According to the words of a Crypto whale, these features result in a comprehensive user-centered DeFi experience, where seamless asset management, low fees, and high liquidity come together—all in one place. The same investor emphasizes that a good way to assess Flary Finance’s potential is to compare it to a similar DeFi platform, which has a fully diluted market cap of around $5.2 billion, while Flary Finance’s is only $9.92 million. The investor explains, “This difference offers a considerable advantage: if Flary reaches this similar DeFi platform's market cap, early investors could see an impressive 524x return. Even if Flary only reaches half of the FDMC, that would still yield a substantial 262x potential return for early token holders!” With its balance of user-focused techniques and technology-driven features, Flary Finance is positioned to capture a large share of the market.

Title: Colorado Bill Would Require Businesses To Disclose Climate Emissions
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmcgowan/2025/02/17/colorado-bill-would-require-businesses-to-disclose-climate-emissions/
Time Published: 2025-02-17T23:44:53Z

Denver, Colorado USA:Gold plated roof top of the Capitol Building of Denver Colorado Colorado has joined the wave of states considering requiring businesses to disclose greenhouse gas emissions. This follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announcing it will eliminate the reporting requirement that was adopted in 2024, but never went into effect. If passed, businesses with a presence in Colorado and over $1 billion in revenue will be required to start reporting as soon as 2028. Following the Paris Agreement in 2015, a series of global initiatives were pursued to reduce the impacts of climate change and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050. A multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms, like BlackRock, used their influence to drive sustainability and environmental, social, and governance. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces. This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry. Funds that claim to be ESG, green, climate friendly, or sustainable must back up those claims with data. As a result of demand and Paris Agreement based initiatives, international regulators began drafting standards for reporting, marketing, and investments relating to climate change and other green initiatives. In 2021, the International Sustainability Standards Board drafted the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation’s Sustainability Disclosure Standards. IFRS is an independent, nonprofit organization that develops financial reporting standards, including international accounting standards. IFRS is not used in the U.S., who uses generally accepted accounting principles, also known as GAAP, but is used in 132 jurisdictions. The IFRS Standards were adopted in June 2023 as the global standard for sustainability and climate change reporting, including greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., the SEC proposed the development of climate-related reporting standards in March 2022. The final rule, adopted on March 6, 2024, required large publicly traded companies to disclose climate action, GHG emissions, and the financial impacts of severe weather events. The Climate-Related Disclosure Rule was initially set to go into effect in 2026. However, it was immediately met with legal challenges and the SEC delayed implementation indefinitely while the cases worked through the judicial process. In February, the acting chair of the SEC announced that the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule was in the process of being repealed. Focus now shifts to the states. In September 2023, California approved the Climate Accountability Package, a pair of bills aimed at creating sustainability reporting requirements. Senate Bill 253 required companies that do business in California and have an excess of $1 billion in revenue, defined as “reporting entities,” to submit an annual report for Scope 1 and Scope 2 starting in 2026. Scope 3 reporting will begin in 2027. California is still drafting the applicable regulations and the reporting timeline is likely to be delayed. Now, Colorado is following suit. House Bill 25-1119, titled “Requiring Certain Entities to Disclose Information Concerning Greenhouse Gas Emissions,” was introduced on January 28 by state representative Manny Rutinel, a Democrat. The bill mimics the requirements of the California legislation. Reporting entities is defined as “an entity that does business in Colorado and has total revenues exceeding one billion dollars in the preceding calendar year, including revenues received by all of the businesses entity’s subsidiaries that do business in Colorado.” The scope of “does business in” has come into question in California and is causing problems for businesses trying to determine if they fall under the reporting requirement or not. It will be interesting to see how Colorado addresses this issue. The reporting of Scope 1, the direct GHG emissions of the company, and Scope 2, the GHG emissions of their energy provider tied to the business’ energy consumption, will begin reporting by January 1, 2027, for the 2027 annual year. Scope 3 reporting will be phased in using a unique definition. Broadly, the bill defines Scope 3 as GHG emissions “other than Scope 2, that are from sources that a reporting entity does not own or directly control. ‘Scope 3 Emissions’ may include emissions associated with a reporting entity’s supply chain, business travel, employee commutes, procurement, waste, and water usage, regardless of location.” By Jan. 1, 2029, companies will need to disclose Scope 3 emissions from the 2028 calendar year from "purchased goods and services, capital goods, and the use of sold products." By Jan. 1, 2030, companies will need to disclose Scope 3 emissions from the 2029 calendar year from “emissions from fuel and energy activities, which emissions are not classified as Scope 1 emissions or Scope 2 emissions; waste generated in operations; processing of sold products; and the end of life of sold products.” By Jan. 1, 2031, companies will need to disclose Scope 3 emissions from the 2030 calendar year from “upstream transportation and distribution, business travel, employee commuting, upstream leased assets, downstream transportation and distribution, downstream leased assets, and franchises.” Notably, the timing of the reporting requirement is, in my opinion, unobtainable. It is unreasonable to require businesses to report GHG emissions from the preceding calendar year on January 1. Most jurisdictions allow six months for businesses to process the information and compile the reports. I expect this will be change as the bill goes through the legislative process. Unique to Colorado, enforcement is delegated to the district attorney and attorney general. If a business fails to comply with the disclosure requirement, they may be prosecuted and face a penalty of $100,000 per day. I expect that to be reduced or otherwise amended. It is too early in the legislative session to predict the chances the bill will make it through the Colorado General Assembly and become law. Democrats control both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Likewise, Governor Jared Polis is Democrat. This greatly increases the likelihood the bill will make it through the legislative process. However, do not underestimate the business lobby’s efforts to kill the bill or make substantial changes.

Title: ROSEN, LEADING INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action – NVO
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/17/3027430/673/en/ROSEN-LEADING-INVESTOR-COUNSEL-Encourages-Novo-Nordisk-A-S-Investors-to-Secure-Counsel-Before-Important-Deadline-in-Securities-Class-Action-NVO.html

February 17, 2025 16:34 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Photo Illustration by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images DOGECOIN CHAMPION POSTS BLOWOUT EARNINGS Dogecoin, the $39 billion joke-turned-blue-chip of the meme coin economy, has been on a wild run, up 220% over the past year. That’s a goldmine for Robinhood, whose customers collectively hold 35 billion DOGE, or about 24% of the token’s entire supply. At current prices, that stash is worth $8.8 billion, though it briefly ballooned to $16.4 billion in December. Crypto has become Robinhood’s cash cow. Q4 results show that digital assets were its top revenue driver, up 700% year-over-year to $358 million, making up 35% of net revenue. For all of 2024, the firm brought in $2.95 billion, while net income soared tenfold to $916 million. And it’s not just dog money: Robinhood’s meme coin buffet also includes BONK, Shiba Inu, Dogwifhat, Trump coin, and Pepe. Read more. COINBASE’S COMEBACK Coinbase just pulled off a comeback worthy of a bull market montage. Q4 net revenue nearly doubled to $2.2 billion, blowing past the $1.8 billion analysts expected. Net income rocketed 1,600% from the previous quarter to $1.3 billion, as trading volume surged 176% to $94 billion—proof that retail investors are back and betting big. Not bad for a company that just a year ago was clawing its way out of post-FTX wreckage, with revenue around $3 billion and its stock trading below $200. Now, with Bitcoin ETFs gaining traction and D.C. getting friendlier, Coinbase is inching back toward its 2021 glory days, when revenue was over $7 billion and shares briefly topped $357. CRYPTO PUSHES FOR INFLUENCE IN D.C. Crypto’s power players have stormed Washington, lobbying for influence in the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, led by Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks, and working to shape discussions with the SEC’s newly formed Crypto Task Force under Commissioner Hester Peirce. Some had hoped for a formal role on the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, initially expected to include industry executives. But sources indicate a different approach favoring issue-specific roundtables over direct industry appointments. Read more.

Learn more By: Ethan Brehm Published: Feb 17, 2025 By: Ethan Brehm, Tim Huber and Sean Tirman Published: Feb 17, 2025 Even if you live a pretty minimalist lifestyle, there’s still a pretty good chance that there’s a set of gear that you need to get you through each and every day — especially if you commute to and from your place of work. As such, you probably also need something in which you can haul that gear, both to keep it all organized and safe in your travels. In that case, you’re going to want a work bag to make that commute with you day-in and day-out. And while there’s not a single bag that works for everyone, there are a number of options that are handsome and tough enough to survive the daily grind of all styles — be they a backpack, messenger bag, briefcase, or otherwise. We’ve gone through the trouble of testing our favorites in this guide to the best work bags for men. Whatever your work life, there’s something here for you.

BackpacksHonorable MentionsTested: The Best Work Backpacks to Carry Daily Article Overview With work bags coming in the form of briefcases, backpacks, and messenger bags, it can sometimes be a bit intimidating knowing what to look for when shopping. Fortunately, regardless as to which style of bag, all three carry solutions share a host of traits and properties that should be taken into account. For our guide, we wanted to represent the three major categories of work bags while also paying attention to usage and purpose (e.g., cycling, gym-to-office, white collar settings). We looked at some of our favorite bag brands and some up-and-comers, paying attention to capacity, construction, materials, aesthetic, laptop sleeve and storage, and price. Once we sourced our units for testing, we spent considerable amounts of hands-on time with each briefcase, messenger bag, and backpack, whittling the list down to a select few that really stood out. We really focused on the practicality of using each bag and how it looked and felt doing so. Our results are detailed below. Primary Construction: The material used to construct a work bag’s shell is of monumental importance, as this one single factor plays an enormous role in determining a bag’s overall quality and durability — making this an absolutely essential area to review when shopping. Modern work bags feature shells that are cut from a wide variety of constructions ranging from old-school leather and canvas models to more contemporary bags crafted from CORDURA, sailcloth, or other modern materials. Secondary Materials: Though admittedly not as important as a bag’s shell material, you’ll still want too explore secondary constructions as these also play a major role in a bag’s overall quality and user experience. Secondary materials to review include a bag’s liner material, back pad, shoulder or crossbody straps, and any other grab handles or attachment points. Hardware: One area that separates the more premium bags on the market from their cheaper counterparts is the hardware that they employ. As such, when shopping for a work bag, you’ll want to review the types of zippers being used, as well as any present buckles or other hardware. Build Quality & Craftsmanship: It’s not just a bag’s material selection that plays a role in its overall quality, but also how those materials have been pieced together that matter. As such, you’ll want to review the construction technique or techniques used to make a bag. What’s more, it’s also worth exploring the brand behind each bag, as smaller more boutique outfits almost always exhibit much better craftsmanship compared to companies mass-producing their bags. Size & Volume: A work bag’s size and volume is also of major importance, as this will directly determine how much gear it can carry, as well as other factors such as weight. We recommend considering the supplies, tech, and other essentials that you plan on regularly commuting with, as this should help you determine what size bag you’ll need in order to comfortable accommodate all of your daily kit. Tech Storage: Technology and devices continue to increasingly permeate almost every aspect of our lives — making tech storage an area of monumental importance to consider when shopping. When reviewing this factor, you’ll want to look into whether or not a bag has a laptop sleeve, and if it does, what size it is, if it’s padded, and if it’s suspended or equipped with a false bottom. We also recommend looking out for organizational features for housing cables, cords, wireless mice, chargers, and other tech peripherals. There are also some bags on the market that feature storage for a laptop and a supplementary tablet — or a second notebook. Organizational Amenities: Alongside storage for tech, modern work bags usually feature a wealth of additional organizational amenities geared towards modern workers, such as pen slips, compartments for files and documents, key fob leashes, and water bottle pockets. Style: Whether you fancy an unmistakably vintage-inspired bag or have more of a proclivity for modern models, the huge diversity of options on the market practically ensure that there will be a work bag out there that will personally resonate with you — making style another crucial area to consider when shopping. Best Minimalist Bag: The messenger bag, especially more modernized and up-to-date versions, are one of the best bag styles for modern men who are frequently on-the-go. And Timbuk2’s Commute 2.0 is an especially hard-working bag that goes perfectly with a lifestyle marked by hustle and bustle. It holds up to 19L of gear, weighs just 2.8 pounds, fits up to a 15″ laptop, has a water-resistant exterior, and has plenty of internal and external pouches and compartments for all your storage needs — including a water bottle pocket. Best of all, this bag is backed by Timbuk2’s lifetime warranty. In a world where bags are getting increasingly more nuanced, there’s still room for simplicity. While the Timbuk2 Commute 2.0 isn’t barebones, it’s certainly straightforward, with basic pocket structure, including two large primary pockets, the front-most having smaller compartments for organizing. However, don’t expect this to be super specialized. On the other hand, the exterior has its fair share of zippered pockets if you do happen to bring along some smaller gear. This includes two underneath the folding lid, which also has two Velcro straps for carrying something like an umbrella or tripod. On the shoulder, the Commute wears very comfortably with its padded strap, while the attachable stabilizer strap might help when cycling, or for days when you’ve simply brought along more than you can handle. I appreciated the webbed lid, which helped keep out the light drizzles I was experiencing during testing. Likewise, the buckles came on and off very easily, but never too easily. At well under $200, the messenger bag is a perfect option for those on a budget, perhaps college students working a summer internship. However, this is definitely a solid pick even if you don’t want all the bells and whistles of a more technical bag. My biggest complaint with the Commute 2.0 is the small size of the water bottle compartment. I carry a larger 32-ounce thermos but it wasn’t fitting inside this pouch. Also, even though it wasn’t our experience during testing, the laptop compartment, while sturdy enough, isn’t suspended at the bottom, which might be an issue if you set this down too hard. However, the bottom of the bag is luckily reinforced very well so that this might not be an issue at all. Verdict: While not the most robust bag in the world, the Timbuk2 Commute 2.0 is still plenty sturdy with its reinforced bottom and water-resistant shell. We loved the straightforward design that doesn’t give you too much, albeit still presenting plenty of pocket options. The water bottle compartment is a bit too small and the laptop sleeve makes us a bit nervous but we didn’t run into any problems in the field. For just $170 or less, this messenger bag will be the perfect choice for lots of buyers. Type: Messenger bag Primary Construction: Recycled Nylon Volume: 19L Weight: 2.8LBs Laptop Sleeve: 15” Best For Cyclists: Chrome Industries first released its game-changing Citizen Messenger Bag back in 1995, and though nearly three decades have passed since that time, the Citizen remains one of the best messenger bags — and best choice for cyclists — on the market. Cut from 1,050-denier nylon — or laminated sailcloth — Chrome Industries’ Citizen Messenger Bag is a 24-liter vessel that features a fully waterproof floating TPE bucket liner that includes separate wet and dry compartments, while also featuring reflective detailing which is great for night riding. Inside, the bag also features a laptop sleeve capable of storing 15” notebooks, while the outside features a crossbody strap equipped with one of Chrome’s signature seatbelt-style quick-release buckles — the latter of which bolsters the bag’s style and character as well as functionality. Recognizing that not every work bag has to be tailored towards the office worker, the Citizen Messenger Bag is a deceptively spacious messenger bag that’s cleverly designed. While bottle sleeves are typically held on the outside of bags, I particularly love the interior side pockets for both a water bottle and umbrella. As for the dedicated laptop sleeve, it won’t look or feel as secure as the ones on your typical laptop bags but it’s certainly more weatherproof. First, you benefit from the sailcloth exterior, then the top of this hidden compartment is sealed with ultra-strong Velcro. Chrome still leaves room on the outside for your pens and pencils with dedicated compartments. Also, if you’re traveling a long distance with the Citizen bag, you’ll be happy to hear that it’s very comfortable around the shoulder and neck area. As I mentioned, the laptop sleeve here isn’t necessarily as great as some others. It’s very unstructured and isn’t padded. However, I opted to bring my own separate sleeve and put that in the dedicated compartment instead, still benefiting from the weatherproofing built in. Also, the main compartment is very large. This thing maxes out at 28L, which can be great if you’re the type of person who wants a catch-all for all your day’s gear. After all, if you’re biking to and from work, there’s a good chance you’ll want to stock up with everything you’ll need throughout the day; this thing can easily double as a work-to-gym bag as well. However, this will be too big for many users. Lastly, while the buckles are highly sturdy, they can be a bit tough to open when you’re in a hurry, especially one-handed –– but at least it closes quickly, which is unarguably more important. Verdict: Large and in charge, the Citizen Messenger Bag from Chrome was a game-changer when it came out in the ’90s and is still just as inventive today. We loved the thoughtful features like the interior bottle compartments and the heavy-duty Velcro to supplement the weatherproof sailcloth shell. While 28L may be a bit much for many workers, this cycling bag will more than carry your day’s worth of work gear, and then some, and is very comfortable to wear on longer journeys. If you’re looking for a laptop messenger bag, you may want to try something else but this is nevertheless a fantastic, fairly priced option for urban commuters. Type: Messenger bag Primary Construction: 1,050D Nylon (or Laminated Sailcloth) Volume: 24L (or 28L) Weight: 2.8LBs Laptop Sleeve: 15” Best Gym-To-Office Bag: Not everyone is going to need a convertible bag that can haul up to 21.4L worth of gear. But for those who do, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better option than the Aer Duffel Pack 3. Not only is this minimalist third-gen bag beautifully-designed, but it’s got an exterior crafted from insanely-rugged water-resistant 1,680-denier CORDURA ballistic nylon, a huge variety of organizational compartments — including a ventilated shoe compartment if you need to swap your commuter sneakers for a nice pair of dress shoes — heavy-duty hardware, a 16-inch laptop pouch, and so much more. Add to that Aer’s signature brand of sleek minimalist aesthetics, and you’ve got one of the best work backpacks that money can buy. And when you’re not using it for work, this bag makes an absolutely superb travel pack or gym bag, as well. You wouldn’t be wrong to feel like this backpack-meets-duffel bag from Aer is your favorite of the bunch, whether or not you’re actually going into the office. The real selling point of the Duffel Pack 3 is its versatility. Of any bag here, this one is the most favorable for transitioning to weekend outings or traveling. Like all of Aer’s backpacks, the shoulder straps here are very comfortable, especially throughout a long day, and with lots of gear in this 21.4-liter bag. Multiple grab handles helps with its carry-on status, as well as attaching to another bag perhaps, or vice versa. Seemingly every place that could potentially house a compartment does house a compartment, and without adding bulk. For instance, there’s a sort of pleated design on the front of the bag, which gives the bag its stylish design language but also adds two large but tight water bottle pockets (one on either side), as well as small, hidden zippered pockets up top. There’s also a zippered pocket in the top of the bag, as well as a drainable shoe pouch at the bottom. Also, the main laptop compartment is a star on its own, with tons of room for extra cables, chargers, and stationary, etc. And the laptop sleeve is suspended, helping it remain protected from drops and the like. My favorite element is the large compartment in front, which features water-resistant zippers that are easy to open. And when I say, “zippers,” I’m referring to two of them. This is ever helpful when it is actually raining and you need to access the interior. When there’s only one zipper, you run the risk of having to open the entire bag if the item you’re looking for is on the other side. Two zippers, however, minimizes water ingress. Also, this compartment has a flex pouch on the inside. But the clever part is that Aer uses the flap that hangs down from the top exterior pocket twofold, allowing it to double as extra coverage over the opening of the flex pocket, bolstering the water-resistance even further. Admittedly, there’s not much to complain about with the Aer Duffel Pack 3. It’s my favorite bag on this list, and not just because I’m partial to backpacks. The price point is also perfect, comfortably under $200. I would, however, love if there were a way to remove the backpack straps and easily add a more traditional duffel strap to the front. On the other hand, this might affect the visual appeal of the Duffel Pack while also eliminating its versatility. Also, as much as I loved the shoe compartment for my low-top shoes (size 12.5), it didn’t fit my high-tops, which I use for playing basketball at the gym. Verdict: Arguably the coolest and most unique bag on this list, the Aer Duffel Pack 3 is a fairly priced backpack that makes complete use of every square inch without adding any bulk. The pockets and compartments are so thoughtfully designed but aren’t too complicated. Large water bottle pockets, a dedicated shoe compartment, and a water-resistant duffel compartment are just bonuses to the well-structured and suspended laptop pocket. Whether you’re going from office-to-gym, traveling for the weekend, or just going about your day with some gear on your back, this is a fantastic choice. Type: Backpack with duffel features Primary Construction: 1,680D CORDURA Volume: 21.4L Weight: 2.9LBs Laptop Sleeve: 16” Best Rugged Briefcase: While Filson is best known for their rugged, heritage-focused gear with a focus on the outdoors, their refined design language unsurprisingly has also paired beautifully into a range of office-friendly gear, as well. Eschewing the standard work bag “look,” their Tin Cloth Compact Briefcase is built with British Millerain’s famed waxed cotton, woven tightly by Filson for abrasion resistance. However, it’s outfitted with a padded 15-inch laptop sleeve, bridle leather handles, and removable shoulder strap for better office friendliness. There’s also a large front stow pocket for papers and folders, a durable YKK zipper, and 9L of space. Filson has several briefcase options that are all worthy of contention. We also liked the Dryden, which is unfortunately no longer available. However, the versatility and ruggedness of this heritage-inspired Tin Cloth bag made it a great choice as well. If you’re looking for a simple, non-cumbersome way to transport your laptop and a few extras into work, then the Filson Tin Cloth Compact Briefcase will be a nice pick. It only holds 9L but that should be perfectly fine for many workers. Also, if you’ve ever owned a Filson bag, you’ll know what to expect in terms of style. The Tin Cloth has a beautifully rugged aesthetic that might not necessarily fit the office milieu in some instances, but can be the perfect outlet for expression in others. As for the laptop compartment, some users will notice that it’s not necessarily as sturdy as some others on this list. However, Filson does give it slight supsension to prevent your laptop from just resting at the bottom of the bag. The briefcase also has quite a wide bottom that actually allows it to stand up on its own with its EVA foam bottom, even with stuff inside. However, I have a MacBook Air, which is very lightweight; I can’t speak to this effect with a heavier laptop. I also appreciated how the Tin Cloth briefcase didn’t smell like waxed cotton canvas can often smell like, especially when it’s been treated with oil like this one has. As I said, the rugged design won’t be for everyone, but this is hardly a point of contention since the bag at no point hides its primary aesthetic. In terms of actual critiques, my main quibbles are with the carrying options. The detachable shoulder strap isn’t necessarily the most comfortable, and could certainly use some sort of padding for the neck area. However, it’s not offensively uncomfortable either, especially considering this briefcase doesn’t hold that much gear. Likewise, the leather handles could also use some sort of padding. I found my hands getting fatigued after just 20 minutes of carrying this. I should also mention that the price here will feel a bit steep for many buyers wondering why a small, simple, 9-liter briefcase costs over $350. While this is to be expected from a heritage brand like Filson and can be justified with their construction methods and durability, I see how it can turn some people off. Verdict: As rugged as you’d expect from Filson, the Tin Cloth Compact Briefcase is a simple, small, and durable briefcase that can effectively carry your laptop without many issues; the laptop sleeve is even suspended and the bag can stand up on its own in most instances. We didn’t love the carrying handles and thought they could use some sort of padding for comfort. Likewise, many will be turned off by the steep price tag here. However, this is an awesome, straightforward work bag for those who are fans of Filson’s distinct, heritage-inspired design ethos. Type: Briefcase Primary Construction: British Millerain waxed cotton canvas with EVA foam base Volume: 9L Weight: 2.6LBs Laptop Sleeve: 15” Best Heirloom Briefcase: Few companies know how to make heirloom-quality bags at reasonable prices. However, while Satchel & Page strikes a balance between affordable and premium price tag, its bags are anything but cheap. Inspired by a World War II-era map bag owned by its founder’s grandfather, the Dallas-based company sources his waterproof 20oz waxed leather canvas from a third-generation family tannery in Italy and manufactures its products in Europe. And it’s that amalgamation of regions that makes products such as their Aviator Brief so special. Made for office workers, the Aviator Brief has a rugged personality but is trimmed handsomely with French cowhide shoulders and given antique brass hardware. Inside, the padded laptop holds up to a 16-inch laptop and has plenty of pockets for organization. From first sight, the Aviator Brief was the most eye-catching of the bunch. Satchel & Page’s aesthetic is very distinct, bringing a sort of stylish simplicity to each piece that I can only describe as “nuanced minimalism.” Like the Filson above, the military-inspired green canvas isn’t the most office-ready but at least the S&P bag has plenty of features to serve its main purpose. Aside from the interior laptop sleeve, which is slightly suspended and situated towards the middle of the bag to keep it away from the sides, the inside has a larger zippered pocket, a few wider pouches, and purpose-built features for items like business cards a writing utensils. Each of the exterior sides has its own large zippered pocket. Also, this bag can stand up on its own thanks to the beefy boot at the bottom. I especially loved the attachable luggage pass-through buckle that threads through outside leather straps, making this a great travel option as well. And best of all, it makes a point to only thread through the side closest to the laptop. This is so that, if the bag falls, it will create a buffer between the ground and your computer. Likewise, the attachable shoulder strap is pretty comfortable on the neck thanks to the adjustable padding. There’s not statement from the brand on the exact capacity of the bag but estimates seem to put this at about 12L or more. From the look of the Aviator Brief to its meticulously designed interior, it doesn’t have a lot of downsides. Even the price, which is relatively similar to the Filson Tin Cloth briefcase, feels more appropriate here for all that you get. However, my biggest issue is the dry weight of the S&P briefcase. Although it’s listed at 3lbs, it feels a bit heavier than that. And seeing that you can fit quite a lot inside, this weight will only get higher. Of course, the high weight is also due to the thickness and density of the canvas and leather materials, which is also a good thing considering it’s housing your laptop and tech. As a minor complaint, the top handles don’t fall flat against the sides when this thing is idle. However, it seems like over time they could break in enough to bend the leather a bit more. Verdict: Arguably the best-looking bag on this list, the Aviator Brief takes Satchel & Page’s design language and transposes it for an office-ready briefcase, equipped with lots of meticulously-designed interior compartments and a laptop sleeve made to prevent any damage caused to your computer. We felt the bag was fairly priced for everything you get. However, we couldn’t help but notice how much heavier it is compared to other briefcases –– but this is just evident of how sturdy the construction is. Type: Briefcase Primary Construction: Waxed canvas from full-grain French cowhide shoulders Volume: Unspecified Weight: 3LBs Laptop Sleeve: 16” Best Backpack: Whether your place of work is just down the street, across town, or on the other side of the country, the Mission Workshop Rhake laptop backpack is undoubtedly a superb work bag for you. This particular version is made from ultra-tough, weatherproof VX-21 fabric — available in three striking colorways — and it can hold up to 22L of gear. It’s also compatible with the brand’s modular Arkiv system via dual exterior integrated rails. And the rolltop closure ensures that all your stuff will stay nice and dry, even if you’re riding your bicycle through a downpour. Aside from the 17-inch laptop compartment, there’s a 10-inch pocket for smaller devices around 10″. Admittedly, the Mission Workshop Rhake is a sight to behold, from both technical and aesthetic perspectives. It’s obvious that the folks behind the backpack have utilized their own real-world knowledge and experience when designing the pack. While the pack has a plethora of compartments, they’re built for organization and are incredibly easy to access and sort through. It can be a pain to rummage through your backpack to find a single item but the meticulous and thoughtful design streamlined this process every time. I loved the large zippered laptop pocket inside, which is unassuming and difficult enough to access for any potential thieves. Likewise, the polyester lining inside creates a barrier between the main pocket and the laptop sleeve –– which is suspended for protection. Utilizing both inside and outside space, the bag sports a large primary rolltop compartment that’s adjustable in size and is perfect for storing bulkier items like a jacket or a lunch box. However, my favorite feature might be the set of buckles below the closure that secures a couple of zippered fold-out pockets. These, as well as the horizontally-running zippered pocket on the front face, are perfect for EDC or tech storage. Each element of the backpack serves a distinct purpose for either convenience or utility. I should also point out how comfortable the shoulder straps are and how easy they are to adjust. At $545, the Rhake is obviously not for the faint of heart. Perhaps a bit too much for some office workers, the backpack will intimidate with the same features that make it so great. However, considering all the features it had, I did wish there was a sort of water bottle pouch. Fortunately, there are enough attachment points that I was able to latch it on with a carabiner (this will only work if you have a closed-handle bottle). I also must mention that the sternum strap doesn’t adjust very far. In fact, I almost couldn’t buckle it in the center when it was loosened all the way –– this might be an issue for broader individuals. Verdict: Utilizing every inch of the backpack, Mission Workshop has outdone itself with the Rhake. Perhaps a bit intimidating for some, this highly-capable technical pack is purpose-built for carrying a laptop to the office (or anywhere, really) and doing so protected from the elements thanks to the weatherproof X-Pac shell. We loved the unique arrangement of tech and EDC storage on the outside, which is easy to access. However, we do know the price will be a bit steep for many buyers. Nevertheless, the Rhake is one of our favorites for a reason. Check out our in-depth Mission Workshop Rhake review here. Type: Backpack Primary Construction: X-Pac VX-21 Volume: 22L Weight: 3.8LBs Laptop Sleeve: 17″ Best Premium Briefcase: If the two canvas briefcases above are too heritage-inspired for you, check out the Palissy Slim Leather Briefcase from Carl Friedrik, an uber-classy white-collar option with a modern look. Holding 10L of gear, it’s available in both smooth and grained vegetable-tanned Italian vachetta leather with nylon lining inside and custom nickel-plated hardware. The dedicated laptop sleeve fits models up to 15″ while the fabric shoulder strap is very soft and easy to stow. At $745, the Palissy is quite the investment but will certainly complement a suit and tie with ease. In the past year or so, we’ve really grown to love Carl Friedrik’s design language, with its minimalist simplicity and touches of almost Deco-inspired lines. We went with the smooth leather option as well, for its flatter appearance. As a side note, the bag exudes a beautiful leather aroma. On the inside, the laptop compartment has an interesting open design, where the top half is exposed. Perhaps controversial, this feature does make access a breeze. If I’m running late for a meeting, it removes an extra step in my setup. There aren’t a ton of extra features inside but there are pockets for pens and business cards, as well as both small- and medium-sized pouches for other tech gear. There’s one compartment on the outside but I’m honestly not sure what it’s for; it’s way too tight to put most things inside. While the bag weighs 3.3lbs, it feels very lightweight. Even if you pack it full, the top handles are comfortable for longer stints of carrying it and the lightweight fabric shoulder strap is really comfortable on the neck. Obviously, $745 is a lot to spend on a briefcase but this is aimed at white collar workers with a higher budget, and will certainly appeal to that crowd. While I loved the open design to the laptop compartment for its easy access, I couldn’t help but feel like it was going to come out in transit (it never did). However, my bigger concern is the lack of suspension with this sleeve, which would prevent any unfortunate damage caused by repeated drops of this bag. On the other hand, Carl Friedrik has put metal feet on the bottom of the bag for separation, so that’s a plus. Verdict: Designed for a white-collar environment, the Carl Friedrik Palissy Slim Leather Briefcase is a handsome, classy bag that’s light in weight. Instantly stunning on a visual level, the bag also has useful interior elements like pen pockets and an laptop sleeve that’s partially exposed for easy access –– a feature that might be controversial for some. At $745, this won’t be for everyone but it’s the perfect briefcase for those who can afford it. Type: Briefcase Primary Construction: Italian vachetta leather Volume: 10L Weight: 3.3LBs Laptop Sleeve: 15″ Briefcases: Boasting a dignified and elegant air, briefcases are a traditional style of work bags that have been sized to carry laptops, documents, and other notebook-sized office essentials. Not unlike messenger bags, briefcases typically sport a low-profile, rectangular shape that comes equipped with a shoulder strap for easy carrying. With briefcases admittedly lack the storage space and organizational amenities of backpacks and larger messenger bags, they can still make for fantastic carry solutions for work, being able to accommodate your daily essentials — and typically not much else. Messenger Bags: Traditionally worn by bicycle messengers, messenger bags are a modern type of carry solution that borrows traits from briefcases, slings, and backpacks. Designed to be worn over the shoulder or across the back, messenger bags can range from compact, simple, and streamlined models to larger, more elaborate vessels brimming with storage space and organizational amenities. And, while these bags obviously still immensely conducive to cycling — and motorcycling — they still make for stellar work bags for those who commute by car, train, or on foot. Backpacks: Backpacks have long been the most popular type of daily carry solution — and for good reason. These storage and carrying solutions offer a generous amount of storage space and an equally robust array of organizational features. A more evolved take on the book bags you likely used in your youth, these bags can hugely differ in terms of style and aesthetics, practically guaranteeing that there’s a backpack out there that will jive with your personal taste. Bellroy does a great job with its minimalist, straightforward items, from wallets to backpacks. We do really like their Tokyo Work Bag as well but just couldn’t justify selecting this messenger bag over our favorites above. Known for resurrecting an old shoe polish company and turning into a modern-day watch brand with vintage Americana aesthetics, Shinola has expanded beyond mere watchmaking with an array of items for both office and lifestyle spaces. So is true with the Runwell Messenger Bag, a classy option, albeit one with a steep $900 price tag. KILLSPENCER is a great brand who does a nice job with its leather bags. However, at $1,500, this Esquire Briefcase is really nice but we couldn’t justify it for the price and considering we already had some solid leather picks above, and for less money. We really love the work that Tom Bihn does with its luggage and bags, and this Tri-Star messenger bag is no different with its unique compartment layout and durability. However, we simply couldn’t get our hands on a unit for testing this time around. Mystery Ranch does some great job if you’re into outdoor tactical bags, and make work bags as well such as this 3 Way Expandable Briefcase. However, we felt the more office-focused approach was better for this guide. Rickshaw makes a Reddit-favorite work bag called the Medium Zero Messenger but we weren’t necessarily blown away by it.

Title: OpenWeb's ousted founder and CEO is back at the tech company in an advisor role after a messy boardroom battle
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/ousted-openweb-ceo-founder-nadav-shoval-returns-advisor-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-17T19:58:10Z
Full Content:
Nadav Shoval, the founder who was ousted as the CEO of OpenWeb by its board in a messy public battle, is back with the adtech company in an advisor role, Business Insider has learned. In an email to employees sent on Friday morning and obtained by BI, OpenWeb's interim CEO, Tim Harvey, announced that the company and Shoval had "reached a mutually agreed resolution" in which Shoval would remain connected to the company as a senior advisor to its chief executive. Later on Friday, the company published a post on its website confirming the move. OpenWeb didn't respond to requests for comment. "We resolved our differences," Shoval told BI. "The company remains committed to its mission of OpenWeb, and I'm excited to continue to support the mission in my role as senior advisor to the CEO." The settlement caps months of drama at OpenWeb that began in mid-2024. Shoval has said that he and some board members disagreed over a potential investment in the company from BlackRock. Shoval's relationship with the board became further strained after the board changed his reporting line — a move that Shoval argued was in breach of his contract because, in his view, it diminished his role and hindered his management capabilities. Shoval wrote to the board in September, demanding that it reverse the change. Later that month, the board fired him. He took the matter public, saying on LinkedIn in September that he hadn't stepped down as CEO. "I do not accept these actions," he wrote. "I will continue to fight for OpenWeb's mission and purpose alongside our team." Shoval also went the legal route. He sued OpenWeb and many of its board members in a court in Tel Aviv, Israel, in October, alleging that he had been the victim of a boardroom coup. The complaint demanded that he be reinstated as CEO and given the ability to appoint two new board members. In response to Shoval's suit, OpenWeb said in court filings that the case was a classic situation in which the board of directors had lost confidence in its CEO. OpenWeb said that Shoval was trying to extract money that was not owed to him and that he had chosen to give up control of the company when he brought in investors. Shoval confirmed that the case was settled. OpenWeb, which has about 350 employees, provides technology to help publishers boost revenue and engagement on their websites, such as comment-moderation and advertising tools. It says its clients and partners include the publishers CNN, Fox, and Hearst and the advertising companies WPP, Dentsu, and Publicis Groupe. Founded in 2012, OpenWeb has raised more than $392 million and was last valued at $1.5 billion. Its investors include the venture capital firms Insight Partners, Georgian Partners, and Index Ventures; companies like The New York Times and Dentsu; and the New York University Stern professor and podcaster Scott Galloway, who sits on the company's board.

Title: These 4 Big Cap Health Care Stocks Just Hit New 52-Week Lows

Healthcare stocks, new lows The health care sector is likely reacting to the uncertainty created by the effect of cuts to the federal budget now being implemented by one of three government branches: the executive aka the White House. The potential loss of Medicaid, for example, would have a huge impact on pharmaceuticals and related industries. And that’s just one example. With the Senate voting to make the anti-vaccine proponent Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services in President Donald Trump’s cabinet, questions about his guidance in that area trouble analysts who cover stocks affected. Investors in these four healthcare stocks haven’t been waiting to see what develops: they’ve been selling. So much unloading has taken place recently that a number of well-known names already have dropped to new 52-week lows. It’s a dramatic difference from the recent popularity of tech and social media stocks. Other factors enter into the new lows, of course, but with that overriding issue, it’s a problem for the sector as a whole. Hologic (NASD: HOLX) Hologic daily price chart, 2 17 25. The red circled spot on these price charts indicates the spot where the stock’s 50-day moving average crossed below its 200-day moving average and a downtrend ensued. The medical instruments and supply company specializes in women’s health issues and features a “women’s health index” on the company website. Market cap is $14.19 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 20. The stock trades at 2.99 book value and the debt-t0-equity ratio is a relatively low (for the sector) 53. The healthcare research investment firm Leerink Partners on February 6 downgraded their opinion of Hologic from “outperform” to “market perform” with a price target of $75. Merck (NYSE: MRK) Merck daily price chart, 2 17 25. The drug manufacturer has a market cap of $209.99 billion. Merck is one of the 30 Dow Jones Industrials and it’s a component of the S&P 500. The price-earnings ratio is 12.33. This year’s earnings are up by 17% and up over the past five years by 12%. The company pays a dividend of 3.92%. On February 10, TD Cowen downgraded the stock from “buy” to “hold” with a price target of $100. Moderna (NASD: MRNA) Moderna daily price chart, 2 17 15. This biotech company has a market cap of $12.70 billion. There is no price-earnings ratio as this year’s “earnings” are down by 4.50% and down over the past five years by 42.94%. Moderna trades at just 1.06 times book. The short float on the stock is a relatively high 11.83% which demonstrates definite interest by those who sell short. The company does not pay a dividend. Goldman on January 29 downgraded Moderna from “buy” to “neutral” with a price target of $51. Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) Novo Nordisk daily price chart, 2 17 25. The drug manufacturer, based in Denmark, has a market cap of $262 billion. Some analysts believe the stock may be suffering from negative reaction to a Super Bowl ad for their product “Him and Hers.” The price-earnings ratio is 23 and the price-to-free cash flow is 24. The next dividend, with an ex-date of March 31, will pay a 2.45% dividend. The short float is a low .40, indicating lack of interest among Wall Street’s short selling crowd.

Title: Man gets suspended sentence over bogus 999 calls
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/02/17/man-gets-suspended-sentence-over-bogus-999-calls/
Time Published: 2025-02-17T16:57:40Z
Full Content:
A man who made more than 30 bogus 999 calls over the course of two years has been given a 3½-year suspended sentence. James Kelly (32), of Rochford Green, Blackrock, Co Dublin, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to six sample charges of knowingly making a false report on dates between February 2021 and March 2023. The court heard gardaí responded to each false report, including making house-to-house inquiries and trawling through hours of CCTV footage. In one incident Kelly claimed he had been the victim of an attempted armed robbery. Gardaí responded to his 999 call, and after meeting him followed up by canvasing the local area for CCTV footage. Kelly was seen on the footage but there was no suspect robber. One officer spent 30 days canvasing footage and four months following up on the case before it was concluded there had been no crime. At a previous sentence hearing last June Judge Pauline Codd said Kelly’s behaviour was a complete waste of Garda time and resources. Sentencing Kelly on Monday, she said he had caused a great nuisance to people who have enough to be doing coping with their own workload. Judge Codd said the frequencies with which the calls were made warranted a headline sentence of five years. She took into account that urine analysis showed Kelly has tested negative for various illicit drugs and previously struggled with addiction. She noted from various testimonials that Kelly works in a voluntary capacity at a local football club and has shown he is capable of living in a pro-social manner. She imposed a sentence of 3½ years, which she suspended in full on strict conditions, including that he engage with the Probation Service for one year and with various addiction support services as directed by the Probation Service. Det Garda Gary Burns told barrister John Moher, prosecuting, at an earlier sentence hearing that a call received on January 13th, 2022, prompted the investigation into the case. The 999 call received that day reported that a fight had broken out in a particular pub and males were throwing bottles at each other. Gardaí immediately responded but when they arrived a minute later there were three people in the bar and it was very quickly established there had been no such disturbance. The 999 caller had identified himself as James. Further investigation led to the nomination of Kelly as a suspect. Kelly gave a voluntarily statement to gardaí in March 2023 having previously been arrested, detained and interviewed. He made no admissions during the initial questioning but took responsibility in his voluntary statement. He said he wanted to apologise for wasting people’s time but said he could not say why he made the calls. “I don’t know really. I think I need to see someone professionally,” he said. Kelly has two previous convictions for possession of articles and one for a public order offence. Det Gda Burns agreed with barrister Pieter Le Vert, defending, that Kelly has ongoing issues with drugs. Counsel said Kelly is a self-confessed compulsive liar. Mr Le Vert said Kelly was addicted to cocaine and alcohol. He has been trying to get into drug rehabilitation but so far has not secured a place. Mr Le Vert said on Monday that his client is now drug-free and has applied for work but has not secured a job. He is due to become a father later this year. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Multiple motors are required to assure safety and enhance efficiency. Electric propulsion advancements based on advancements in motor, battery, fuel cell, and electronic controller technologies have led to the growth of this technology. The requirement for new car technology to guarantee Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is another factor driving it.

Congested urban regions are driving North America. North America held the major share of the eVTOL aircraft market in 2024. Modern transportation alternatives like eVTOL planes are much needed because North America is home to some of the most crowded urban areas in the world. To improve mobility and lessen traffic congestion, cities including Dallas, New York, and Los Angeles are looking at eVTOL flying taxi services. The well-established infrastructure in the region, including heliports, potential urban vertiport locations, and already-existing airports, can also make it easier to deploy eVTOL aircraft. Additionally, work is being done to build vertiports, charging stations, and maintenance facilities—infrastructure made especially for eVTOL operations. Additionally, the military and large corporations are entering into more contracts, which helps the region's economy grow. Rising technology is driving the Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific is estimated to achieve a significant growth rate in the eVTOL aircraft market during the predicted timeframe. Urban congestion and increased urbanization, especially in large cities in China, India, Japan, Australia, and South Korea, are the main causes of the region's rapid growth. Emerging markets such as China and India provide substantial prospects for the eVTOL industry because of their sustained robust GDP development. Because of its steady economic growth and official backing in the form of advantageous laws, money, and alliances, China is drawing significant foreign investments. Furthermore, the development of eVTOL is supported by a strong technical ecosystem in Asia Pacific, which includes developments in battery technology, 5G connectivity, and artificial intelligence (AI). These elements work together to create the perfect setting for the growth of the eVTOL business in the area. eVTOL Aircraft Market Report Coverage You can place an order or ask any questions, please feel free to contact at sales@precedenceresearch.com | +1 804 441 9344 eVTOL Aircraft Market Segmentation Analysis: Browse More Insights: eVTOL Aircraft Market Top Companies What is Going Around the Globe?

Title: BUSTED: America First Legal Shows Judge Financially Entangled With His Own Trump Ruling...If this doesn't warrant a recusal, NOTHING does

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/17/2025 6:44:11 AM PST by Red Badger The problem with judge-shopping to push your case through, there’s always the chance that the judges you are counting on to push your agenda have their own skin in the game. That’s the case with a judge who has offered very dubious rulings on whether Trump can suspend his USAID money. We’ve got a thread from America First Legal making the case online that Judge McConnell, the Rhode Island judge who put an end to Trump’s spending freezes, ought never to have heard that case in the first place. The reason? He is *Personally* benefitting financially from his own ruling. If the money gets cut, so does funding from a group whose board he has served on for as long as he’s held federal office — much of that time, serving as chair. The Trump administration has violated a court order by refusing to reverse a freeze of billions in government funds, a judge ruled Monday. The ruling was the latest challenge to sweeping White House plans to cut costs and remake the US government. US District Judge John McConnell Jr previously ruled that the government should continue to fund programmes authorised by Congress. On Monday, he said the White House had defied a preliminary injunction that the judge issued after 23 Democratic state attorneys general filed a lawsuit to stop the funding freeze. The Trump administration said it would appeal the ruling. — BBC It’s one of many lawsuits the Dems have ginned up against the Trump admin… and one of the more aggressive. But there’s a twist: Judges are expected to recuse themselves from cases in which they have any personal stake in the outcome. When a company on whose board you sit is downstream of the threatened funding to the tune of millions of dollars… that would be an example of a reason to recuse. And yet, he heard the case anyway. Ruled on it, even. And wouldn’t ya know it, the ruling happened to align with his personal interests. But we can trust him, right?

We’ve got a thread from America First Legal making the case online that Judge McConnell, the Rhode Island judge who put an end to Trump’s spending freezes, ought never to have heard that case in the first place. The reason? He is *Personally* benefitting financially from his own ruling. If the money gets cut, so does funding from a group whose board he has served on for as long as he’s held federal office — much of that time, serving as chair. The Trump administration has violated a court order by refusing to reverse a freeze of billions in government funds, a judge ruled Monday. The ruling was the latest challenge to sweeping White House plans to cut costs and remake the US government. US District Judge John McConnell Jr previously ruled that the government should continue to fund programmes authorised by Congress. On Monday, he said the White House had defied a preliminary injunction that the judge issued after 23 Democratic state attorneys general filed a lawsuit to stop the funding freeze. The Trump administration said it would appeal the ruling. — BBC It’s one of many lawsuits the Dems have ginned up against the Trump admin… and one of the more aggressive. But there’s a twist: Judges are expected to recuse themselves from cases in which they have any personal stake in the outcome. When a company on whose board you sit is downstream of the threatened funding to the tune of millions of dollars… that would be an example of a reason to recuse. And yet, he heard the case anyway. Ruled on it, even. And wouldn’t ya know it, the ruling happened to align with his personal interests. But we can trust him, right?

The Trump administration has violated a court order by refusing to reverse a freeze of billions in government funds, a judge ruled Monday. The ruling was the latest challenge to sweeping White House plans to cut costs and remake the US government. US District Judge John McConnell Jr previously ruled that the government should continue to fund programmes authorised by Congress. On Monday, he said the White House had defied a preliminary injunction that the judge issued after 23 Democratic state attorneys general filed a lawsuit to stop the funding freeze. The Trump administration said it would appeal the ruling. — BBC It’s one of many lawsuits the Dems have ginned up against the Trump admin… and one of the more aggressive. But there’s a twist: Judges are expected to recuse themselves from cases in which they have any personal stake in the outcome. When a company on whose board you sit is downstream of the threatened funding to the tune of millions of dollars… that would be an example of a reason to recuse. And yet, he heard the case anyway.

investors who choose stocks selling at extravagant valuations — such as 100 times revenue —are ... [+] fighting an uphill battle. There are no sure ways to win in the stock market. But here’s a fairly sure way to lose: Invest in a stock that sells for 100 times revenue or more. The price/sales ratio for General Motors is less than one, for McDonald’s Corp. about 9, and for Microsoft about 12. Even Tesla, which has a loyal and rabid following, goes for less than 13 times sales. When I’m looking for stocks to buy, I usually want to see a ratio of 2 or less. Stocks that sport a price/sales multiple of 100 or more are hope stocks, dream stocks. And they are popular stocks, at least with speculators. That’s why they sell for such an extravagant multiple. Let me suggest a few of these stocks to avoid. They are red hot, and might burn you. Strategy Inc. (MSTR) – known until this month as MicroStrategy Inc. -- fetches 139 times revenue. The company, based in Tysons Corner, Virginia, and run by Michael Saylor, sells business software but has posted a loss in four of the past five years. Its value comes from the trove of Bitcoin Saylor has accumulated -- and continues to accumulate. That hoard consists of 478,740 bitcoins, making Strategy the largest single holder in the world. The current market value of its coins is around $47 billion. But the market value of the stock is much greater than that, about $87 billion. So why do people buy Strategy stock instead of just buying the coins? There are several possible reasons – they may, for example, think Saylor is a shrewd cryptocurrency market timer – but I think it’s folly. IonQ Inc. (IONQ), out of College Park, Maryland, sells access to the use of quantum computers and is also working on ways to improve such computers. Josh Schneider, a writer for IBM Blog, says that quantum computing uses the unique qualities of quantum mechanics and “will soon be able to solve complex problems that supercomputers can’t solve, or can’t solve fast enough.” IonQ’s revenue for the past four quarters was about $37 million. The stock market values the company at more than $8 billion, for a price/sales ratio of 210. Based in Redwood City, California, Revolution Medicines Inc. (RVMD) is working on a new type of cancer therapy. It involves inhibiting uncontrolled cell growth by altering certain genes known as RAS genes. All 15 Wall Street analysts who follow the company recommend its stock, many of them strongly. I feel that the stock is highly speculative, since the price/sales ratio is more than 8,000. I wish the company luck, but I’ve seen many promising oncology stocks bite the dust in the past. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT) is a nascent business run by President Donald Trump. I think many people buying the stock are expressing their political preferences through an investment lens. Revenue in the past four quarter was less than $3 million. The company’s market value is well over $6 billion. So, the price/sales ratio is more than 1,600. I think Trump can grow the company dramatically – but I feel the stock is priced as if that had already happened. AST SpaceMobile Inc. (ASTS) went public in 2021 by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The stock was a dud until mid-2024, when the company signed an agreement to provide satellite service to AT&T’s mobile phone network. In the past year, it’s up more than 800%. Analysts predict a huge increase in revenue this year and next, but they don’t project profitability until perhaps 2027. Their average one-year price target ($34.20) is less than 7% above the current price. The price/sales ratio here for the moment is more than 1,800. I’ve written 19 previous columns on stocks selling for 100 times revenue. In 15 cases, the stocks I warned about did worse than the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index over the next 12 months. In 13 cases they sustained losses. My warnings covered 84 stocks. Sixty of them declined, and 21 of them fell 50% or more within a year. The average one-year return for all 84 stocks was a loss of 22.2%, while the S&P gained 9.3% on average. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Disclosure: In a hedge fund I run, I have a short position in Strategy Inc., betting on a decline.

Title: Jeff Bezos' Washington Post backs out of running $115,000 front page advertisement targeting Elon Musk

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/17/2025 5:13:14 AM PST by dennisw The Jeff Bezos' owned Washington Post has reportedly backed out of running a $115,000 front page advertisement targeting DOGE head Elon Musk amid the Amazon founder's budding friendship with President Donald Trump. Advocacy group Common Cause announced that it had signed the costly agreement with the newspaper to run an ad that would have covered the entire front and back page of Tuesday's paper as well as a full page advertisement inside the paper. The group said it planned to purchase the ad in collaboration with the Southern Poverty Law Center Action Fund. Copies of the paper with the wrap would then be sent to subscribers on Capitol Hill, at the Pentagon and at the White House, according to The Hill. The ad's design, which is still available on the group's website, features a large photo of Musk with his head tilted back, laughing, along with a cutout image of the White House. 'Who's running this country: Donald Trump or Elon Musk?' it asked. Further down on the page, the advertisement features smaller text that reads: 'Since day one, Elon has created chaos and confusion and put our livelihoods at risk. And he is accountable to no one but himself. 'The Constitution only allows for one president at a time,' it says. 'Call our senators and tell them it's time Donald Trump fire Elon Musk.' It also included the URL FireMusk.org.

Title: Blockchain Rewiring TradFi: A Trillion-Dollar Shift
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2025/02/17/blockchain-rewiring-tradfi-a-trillion-dollar-shift/
Time Published: 2025-02-17T13:08:55Z
Full Content:
blockchain and financial technology. The race to remake global finance is heating up, and the starting gun has already fired on Wall Street. While traditional banks grapple with systems that trap trillions in idle capital, a new financial architecture is emerging from the fusion of blockchain technology and traditional finance (TradFi). The prize isn't just eliminating the friction that costs the industry billions in settlement delays and reconciliation headaches—it's fundamentally rewiring how money moves. Early movers aren't just experimenting anymore; they're driving the financial blockchain market toward a projected $49.2 billion by 2030, up from $2.1 billion in 2023. The shift isn't just theoretical. At Davos 2025, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan likened crypto to established payment systems: "If you go down the street here and buy lunch, you could pay with Visa, Mastercard, a debit card, Apple Pay, and so on. In that sense, cryptocurrency would just be another form of payment." Behind the glass towers of Wall Street, this future is already materializing. The DTCC’s Project Ion, leveraging distributed ledger technology, is rewiring financial infrastructure’s fundamental plumbing by shifting from batch to real-time processing and creating a single, unified transaction record—slashing reconciliation costs and delivering significant savings. Already handling over 100,000 bilateral equity transactions daily, with peaks reaching 160,000 trades, Project Ion operates within today's T+2 settlement framework while blazing the trail toward T+1 and potentially T+0 settlement—a shift that could unlock billions in capital currently trapped in settlement limbo. Banking giants BNY Mellon, Citi, and JP Morgan aren't just watching from the sidelines—they're already all in. Cross-border payments remain the industry's biggest bottleneck—slow, costly, and reliant on an outdated patchwork of intermediaries. Trillions move across borders every year, yet transactions can take days, saddled with 4%+ fees and opaque banking rails. Enter stablecoins—by converting fiat into digital tokens on global blockchain networks, banks unlock 24/7, near-instant money movement at scale. This innovation lets institutions bypass correspondent banking friction entirely, settling transactions in minutes rather than days. JPMorgan Coin already processes $1 billion in daily settlements, and the broader market for tokenized dollars is on track to hit $400 billion by 2025. The economic case is striking: where traditional transfers trap money for days and drain substantial fees, blockchain-powered stablecoins deliver instant settlement at a fraction of the cost. This shift has tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon building Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms, accelerating enterprise blockchain adoption. The transformation spans every corner of finance. Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and Standard Chartered have launched blockchain initiatives to streamline operations, while payment giants Visa and Mastercard are integrating the technology into their global networks. Asset management leaders Fidelity, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan are pushing into real-world assets (RWA), recognizing blockchain's potential to transform asset tokenization and settlement. Franklin Templeton's expansion of its money market fund across Solana, Ethereum, Stellar, and other major blockchain networks signals a new phase—traditional asset managers are no longer experimenting; they're building multi-chain infrastructure for the future. Global crossborder digital payment and tokenization Three key forces are accelerating blockchain's adoption in TradFi: First, legacy banking systems struggle to meet real-time global demands; second, regulatory clarity around digital assets is improving; third, institutional investors—once skeptical—are now integrating blockchain solutions to bridge traditional and digital finance. Unlike early blockchain disruptors who sought to replace traditional finance, today's players are bridging legacy systems with digital innovation—prioritizing functionality over disruption. The road ahead presents a delicate balancing act. As banks and financial institutions embrace blockchain, they must navigate the fine line between pushing innovation forward and staying within regulatory bounds. Enterprise solutions like R3 Corda are emerging as crucial bridges, offering the institutional-grade infrastructure needed for this transition. At the same time, decentralized networks are evolving to put compliance first—pointing toward a future where innovation and regulation coexist in harmony. Among new solutions, Chainlink, Aave, and Compound are pioneering DeFi infrastructure, while Graphite Network is bridging TradFi and DeFi, offering verification and compliance-focused solutions that major institutions can trust. A reputation-based Layer 1 blockchain, it integrates privacy-preserving KYC (ZKPs), institutional compliance, and high-speed transactions (1,400 TPS at low fees). Each account has a behavior-based reputation score, protecting users from untrustworthy members. Verified single-user accounts and Proof-of-Authority Polymer 2.0 deliver compliant, scalable blockchain solutions for large projects. However, institutional players face a fundamental challenge: aligning blockchain's transformative promise with TradFi's relentless demand for speed and reliability. As titans like Nasdaq, CME Group, and ICE explore blockchain integration, they confront a staggering benchmark—traditional financial networks routinely process upwards of 65,000 transactions per second during peak times, a volume that would overwhelm most blockchain systems. While Layer 2 solutions such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon have delivered incremental speed boosts and reduced costs, these fixes simply can't scale to meet the colossal throughput and near-instant finality demanded by modern institutional finance. This staggering performance pressure has sparked a new wave of foundational innovation. Rather than merely patching existing systems, emerging Layer 1 solutions are reengineering the blockchain's very core to tackle scalability and efficiency at an enterprise level. Among these, DevvE integrates enterprise compliance frameworks with Web2 functionality through RESTful APIs. Backed by global patents and a non-custodial instant settlement exchange, DevvE enables real-world asset tokenization with excellent scalability and lightning-fast L1 transaction speeds. Will Stewart, a veteran in global finance, recently joined DevvDigital’s Board to drive institutional adoption, reinforcing DevvE’s position as a key player in financial evolution. With scalability solutions maturing, attention has shifted to perhaps the most transformative application of blockchain in traditional finance: asset tokenization. Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is blockchain’s most promising institutional use case. Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and UBS are exploring tokenization, while JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have already run controlled pilots testing digital representations of bonds and private equity. Early security token pioneers like Polymath and Harbor proved feasibility but lacked mass adoption. Today, platforms like Securitize, tZERO, and Templum have taken the lead, effectively bridging traditional finance with blockchain. As tokenization gains traction, AI-driven compliance is emerging as a competitive edge. Rexas Finance is leveraging this approach, allowing users to tokenize a wide range of assets, from real estate to intellectual property, while ensuring automated compliance and global trading capabilities. With $45M+ raised and 47,000+ holders, Rexas provides a secure, scalable infrastructure that streamlines asset management for both institutional and retail investors. Seamless multi-chain integration enables fast, secure, and cost-effective transactions, making asset tokenization more accessible. Moving forward, successful platforms will be those that balance blockchain’s limitless potential with institutional finance’s practical requirements. With DeFi platforms projected to reach a $100 billion valuation, the transformation isn’t theoretical—it’s happening now. While blockchain promises to revolutionize finance, its journey is fraught with significant risks. The $165 million ASX blockchain upgrade failure in 2022 starkly reminds us that even the most well-funded projects can stumble. But it's not just about failed implementations – the stakes are exponentially higher when it comes to security. Picture a smart contract flaw that could instantly freeze millions in assets or a private key breach that makes traditional password hacks look like child's play. This is why financial giants aren't rushing headlong into the blockchain future. Instead, they're adopting what insiders call a "walk-before-run" strategy: JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs maintain their battle-tested legacy systems alongside blockchain pilots, while BNY Mellon is investing heavily in blockchain forensics. Their message is clear: in the race to transform finance, security isn't just another checkbox – it's the foundation upon which everything else builds. Global financial institutions are already committing billions to blockchain integration. The next phase will bring standardization, deeper integration, and hybrid financial models that blend traditional and blockchain infrastructure. By accelerating settlement speeds and eliminating inefficiencies, blockchain isn't just upgrading financial systems—it's fundamentally reimagining them for the digital age.

The technology PR landscape has shifted dramatically since 2020, with artificial intelligence, data analytics and digital channels reshaping how companies communicate their innovations. Major tech firms like OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) now regularly face intense public scrutiny over their A.I. developments, while companies like Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) navigate complex regulatory environments across global markets. PR professionals must master new tools and strategies to manage these challenges effectively. The intersection of technology and communication demands a sophisticated approach that combines traditional PR principles with advanced digital capabilities. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. PR teams at leading tech companies now use A.I. tools to analyze media sentiment, predict emerging trends and create targeted content. For example, Microsoft‘s communications team employs natural language processing to monitor social media conversations in real-time, allowing them to respond rapidly to potential issues before they escalate. Similarly, IBM‘s PR department uses A.I.-driven analytics to identify the most effective times and channels for press releases, resulting in increased media pickup rates. The numbers tell a compelling story: According to Cision’s 2023 State of the Media Report, 78 percent of PR professionals now use A.I. tools for at least one aspect of their work. These tools range from Synthesio’s AI-powered social listening platform to PressPage’s automated media monitoring systems. Modern tech PR requires a solid foundation in data analytics. For example, when Nvidia wanted to showcase its role in advancing A.I. technology in the digital and physical worlds, its PR strategy underscored Nvidia (NVDA)’s role in the A.I. ecosystem and how its A.I. models transform industries like robotics, climate science and healthcare. A similar data-driven PR push can enhance A.I. workflows across all sectors. Key components of successful data-driven PR include: Tech ethics has become a central concern for PR professionals. For instance, when ChatGPT faced criticism over bias in its responses, OpenAI‘s communications team implemented a transparent approach to addressing these concerns. They published detailed blog posts explaining their methodology and hosted public forums with A.I. ethics experts. Successful tech ethics communication strategies often include: Tech companies often face unique crisis scenarios, from data breaches to A.I. mishaps that require well-thought-out crisis management strategies. As proof of this, LastPass experienced a security breach in 2022, and their PR team executed a response plan. This plan included an immediate notification to affected users, regular updates on the investigation progress, technical briefings for security journalists and a comprehensive remediation roadmap. This approach helped maintain customer trust and quell anxiety around the incident. Digital channels now dominate tech PR strategies. For example, AMD’s launch of its Ryzen processors included partnerships with tech influencers who reached over 50 million viewers combined. The campaign generated millions of engagements across social platforms and contributed to a 23 percent increase in market share. Effective digital strategies typically incorporate the following: Modern tech PR requires sophisticated measurement approaches. To illustrate this, Muck Rack compiled a list of metrics PR pros should measure: share-of-voice, stories placed, advertising-value-equivalency, reach/impressions, sentiment, key message pull-through, website traffic and social engagement. In fact, according to The State of PR report from Muck Rack, 66% of PR pros say producing measurable results is the best way to increase the value of PR to key stakeholders. Key developments in the tech PR space may come to fruition in the next few months. For example, quantum computing will create new communication challenges to address, while we may see AR/VR become the primary channel for press events. A.I. will likely automate 50 percent of routine PR tasks, and blockchain will verify press release authenticity. The technology PR landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Success requires a combination of traditional PR expertise and mastery of new tools and techniques. PR professionals who stay ahead of these trends while maintaining a focus on clear, authentic communication will lead the industry forward. To succeed in this environment, start by auditing your current tech stack, investing in AI-powered tools, and developing a data-driven strategy that aligns with your company’s technical expertise and ethical standards.

Title: The Cult of the Entrepreneur

Three cheers for the entrepreneur! Three cheers for that swashbuckling master of society’s rocky, reef strewn seas! They are the best! They are good vibes! And who are “they,” you ask so skeptically? The entrepreneur is a small-business owner, a David to the Goliath of corporate conformity. He is also an incredibly wealthy business founder who presides over a massive, nonunionized workforce and is something of a Goliath himself. Three cheers for both David and Goliath! Ray Kroc and Sam Walton: definitely entrepreneurs. Their employees: not. But someone can be an entrepreneur while also being an employee, working at a huge company. This is getting confusing. Entrepreneurs make their own work, love their jobs, and never complain. Because they can’t! Because they are self-employed and/or their own boss. Three cheers for the entrepreneur who is an individual above all else, with no connection to any other person beyond the money that can be extracted from them! Now that I consider it, I’m not sure what exactly an entrepreneur is. Is it just someone who starts a business? But why is starting a business good, when we don’t know what kind of businesses are being started? Conservatives surely don’t want more abortion access startups, and liberals wouldn’t rally behind a new gun manufacturer. The term is mind-bogglingly inclusive, as the historian Erik Baker notes in his new book, Make Your Own Job: How the Entrepreneurial Work Ethic Exhausted America, which chronicles the creation and ascendance of the idea of entrepreneur from the end of the nineteenth century until today, through the writings of popular psychologists, self-help authors, and management theorists. “Our image of ‘the entrepreneur,’” Baker writes, is “dominated by two antipodal figures: the tech billionaire and the gig worker using that billionaire’s app to scrape out an income.” When both the ruler and ruled are entrepreneurs, what could it possibly mean? We live in a time in which all our lives are dominated by massively powerful monopoly corporations, and yet we focus on a mythical, marginal figure. The triumphalism of the entrepreneur reached a fever pitch in the period following the Great Recession. The entrepreneur was valorized everywhere, accepted as a universal good, touted by extreme conservative business leaders and social democrats alike. Thousands of business school courses on entrepreneurship are taught by scores of endowed chairs. But why? What is so special about entrepreneurialism and small business? Two new books show how the celebration of small business and the entrepreneur has recurred in American history, emerging out of crises, playing to vague notions of democratic ideals and diverting attention from those who caused these crises in the first place. When the founders of the United States got together to draft their framework for a government, industrial production—large factories churning out goods with large workforces tending machinery—only existed at the margins. The country was an agrarian economy with small cities and a high degree of self-employment. Firms were generally small, and even by 1850 the average employer had only about eight employees. (Though rare, large employers like the New England cotton producer Pacific Mills had thousands of workers.) And so it was that the rise of the industrial economy after the Civil War caused a major existential crisis for the young nation. With the new machines and mass production, firms got bigger, self-employment declined, and an increasing number of people worked for a wage. For the first time, the nation was no longer a society of farmers and small businesses. But the country had been founded on a vision of autonomy that rested on Thomas Jefferson’s cherished idea of the “yeoman farmer.” The rapid increase in industrial production in the nineteenth century was fed by the twin rise of finance and monopoly businesses, which accelerated the boom-and-bust cycle of the economy as money rushed into and out of sectors and firms. Regularly, the economy would crash, and there were many financial crises between 1873 and 1920. Working people’s hours and income fluctuate wildly as firms try to cut costs during lean time and raise employment in fat ones. Layoffs and wage cuts rained down on workers who had little control over job conditions. Industrialization, that is, invented mass unemployment and instantiated it as a seemingly permanent facet of American life. As Baker points out, the word “unemployment” first appeared in print in 1887. So how did America react to the rolling crises of financial crashes and mass unemployment? Some workers rushed into unions, like the Knights of Labor, that insisted on formalizing and smoothing out these cycles by getting firms to agree to basic wages, regular hours, and constraints on the bosses’ ability to hire and fire willy-nilly. Workers argued that companies should not be able to callously speculate with the futures of their workers’ lives. They demanded more structure and less chaos. But into the chaos of working-class life rushed self-help gurus who admonished working people to abandon the hope of ever taming the corporate leviathans and to go to work for themselves. They suggested that instead of confronting this massive shift in American life, people just ignore it. Writers like Orison Swett Marden, a “bald, mustachioed hotel magnate,” as Baker has it, told his audience that they should pretend to be participating in an open market for their time and effort (even though, he never mentioned, they were legally subordinated to their bosses). “Get this idea that you are an employee out of your head,” he wrote. “You are in business for yourself, selling your skill to your employer.” Technically, the workers were not in business for themselves, but this didn’t matter. This idea provided guidance for the masses of people struggling to understand how they should operate in a society in which their employers, on which their livelihoods depended, didn’t seem to care much about them. Marden founded Success magazine in 1897, a publication that encouraged workers to “make their own job” and “work for a business as if it were your own.” The latter is an idea that corporate types to this day advise each other over coffee. I heard one man giving a younger man this very advice last month in a Manhattan coffee shop. Marden’s advice was part of an intellectual movement called New Thought, which varied in its texture and application, but was a self-help ideology that suggested creativity and happiness could be found even among the grinding realities of the assembly line. It was almost tailor-made for the people who instituted this system—like Henry Ford, who had boiled jobs down from complex craft to repetitive tasks so routine and dull they drove workers crazy, such as tightening the same three bolts on chassis all day as they rolled by on the line. And yet Ford was a big proponent of New Thought and claimed that, as a society, “We have limited the creative faculty too much and have used it for too trivial ends.” This elided the fact that he himself had limited the creativity of work so dramatically that it was essentially outlawed in his factories. These ideas were backed by scientists like Harvard psychologist Hugo Münsterberg, who believed working-class discontent stemmed not from the social and economic conditions brought about by extreme employer power, but from the faulty minds of the workers themselves: “The feeling of monotony depends much less upon the particular kind of work than upon the special disposition of the individual,” he wrote in 1913. New Thought said: If you find work boring, terrible, and scarce, you can change it by changing your attitude! “This advice celebrated the value of innovation while also reassuring those who found stimulating work hard to come by—a welcome message for Henry Ford as well as for those struggling to figure out how to make a life in the world he was reshaping,” Baker writes. Crisis struck again. When the financial crash of 1929 hit, ripping open the gates for the Great Depression to spill out and drown the nation in unemployment, Marden’s message was ready to be updated. Popular psychologists and success writers like Dale Carnegie, Napoleon Hill, and Norman Vincent Peale rushed in with tracts about how enterprising people could find happiness and wealth among devastation just by going into business on their own. One popular book encouraged people to rescue themselves from unemployment by taking up odd jobs, suggesting they could find stability by “making bird houses, reading tea leaves, performing genealogical research, knitting cozies for baby bottles, and even breeding tropical fish,” as Baker finds. The book was today’s equivalent of a TikTok influencer telling you how to get rich on passive income generated from an Amazon third-party seller account and wooden coasters sold on Etsy. Side-hustle advice emerges as a response to economic adversity. The response to the Great Depression on a governmental level was not to celebrate the side hustle but to enable and formalize massive corporations and balance their power with a strong regulatory state and the empowerment of labor unions. Influential theorists who had Franklin Roosevelt’s ear, like the indefatigable Adolf A. Berle, took the model Ford had pioneered and aimed to harness and institutionalize it by reforming securities law, labor law, and creating welfare institutions. The large corporation was thought to be good because of its efficiency: It could more quickly move and deploy capital it raised in public markets than could a set of smaller companies. It could be more easily regulated because it was a single firm with hundreds or thousands of employees. Workers demanded more job security from these firms, and, after a period of sometimes bloody unrest, the government ultimately enabled this project by not only passing the hard-won National Labor Relations Act in 1935, but inventing Social Security and other welfare measures. Midcentury thinkers on the left and right praised the Fordist New Deal state as incontestably better than any alternatives. John Kenneth Galbraith exemplified the consensus from the left when he wrote, “No one seriously argues that the small firm is ordinarily more efficient, more progressive, more responsible, more enlightened, that it pays better wages or that it sells at a lower cost than the large corporation.” Entrepreneurs, be damned. Even conservatives sang the praises of Fordism while casting the entrepreneur to the dustbin of history. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce magazine Nation’s Business wrote, “In the past century the private inventor was our public glory.” Not so in the midcentury, when “most big-time inventions are produced by corporations and their staff of trained engineers.” The conservative management thinker Peter Drucker praised the corporation for its efficiency but also for the way managers operated like enlightened statesmen. Big, bureaucratic corporations were superior. But Fordism was an awkward fit for American life, especially considering that the founding documents of the nation had not said anything about work and were not designed for relations between the owners of gigantic firms like Ford and their workers. The corporation was in no way democratic; even with a union, managers controlled the workers like mini dictators. For the professional workers, the massive corporation provided security, but in return extracted a high degree of control through repression, process, and conformity. The midcentury New Deal state was essentially a privatized socialism, with the corporate leaders holding the reins of society. When the power of the Fordist corporation started to falter in the late 1950s and 1960s, thinkers on both the right and left did an about-face. The conservative journalist William Whyte decried the un-American nature of the corporate office worker in his landmark book, The Organization Man, finding that the large corporation had turned Americans into unthinking, robotic workers. Whyte introduced a critique of the working life under corporate rule that has scarcely gone away: Large companies stifle the American spirit of individual freedom. One bit of evidence that Whyte presented was that hardly any graduating seniors at Yale were interested in being entrepreneurs (by his own survey). This, he seemed to suggest, was a sign of a major character defect. One problem with Whyte’s critique was that this period brought the highest degree of wage growth for working people in U.S. history. But Whyte’s complaint about the lack of entrepreneurialism was not economic. It was an issue with the design of our culture. “The generations of experts who developed and popularized the vocabulary of entrepreneurialism succeeded ... because the gospel of job creation filled a fundamental ideological need in American society,” Baker writes. The left-leaning counterculture also picked up on a critique of corporate life and corporations’ enthusiastic headlong dive into the Vietnam War. Major unions, their fates staked to the Fordist system of private governance, largely supported the war and lost the confidence of young people as the 1960s wore on. The counterculture also decried the homogenizing effect of large corporations that Whyte noted. And positive psychologists and social scientists like Erich Fromm and Abraham Maslow thought that “ego weakness” and conformity opened the door to authoritarianism, the kind of conformity other theorists like David Riesman had found in corporate workers, birthing yet another wave of self-help gurus promoting small business. The counterculture blamed the corporate state and looked elsewhere for solutions, which it would find in adoration of the entrepreneur. Maslow is a fascinating character in Baker’s book, a leading figure who praised and promoted the entrepreneurial attitude while also laying bare its contradictions (though not necessarily on purpose). Maslow once noted that, in the United States, “The entrepreneurial function is too much underplayed and undervalued.” The problem was that workers were too feisty and made things too hard for their “superiors,” who were the real entrepreneurs. American culture had “arranged things in such a fashion that the boss or leader or general or successful person tends to be put on the defensive.” Maslow’s vision of the entrepreneur is, as Baker notes, fairly authoritarian itself. Objections to the massive corporate state amplified in importance as economic growth slowed in the 1960s and wages began to stagnate in the 1970s, leading to the crisis of “stagflation” as both stagnation and inflation escalated. This time, the left critique of corporate malfeasance and the way it encouraged repression of individuality met up with a right-wing critique of the regulatory state, both of which located “entrepreneurialism” and small business as the solution, as Benjamin Waterhouse explores in his book One Day I’ll Work for Myself: The Dream and Delusion That Conquered America. Waterhouse is a professor at the University of North Carolina, and his book covers similar terrain to Baker’s but is largely about the lobbyists, corporations, and politicians that pushed the ideas of entrepreneurship and the veneration of small business in the United States. The New Deal compact was faltering; the ideas of entrepreneurialism were lying around ready to provide a solution. Business interests could blame regulation and bureaucracy (which had ensured workers got their share of profits and economic progress), while the counterculture could blame corporations for conformity and warmongering. Waterhouse documents how small-business advocates and lobbyists like the National Federation of Small Business denigrated the New Deal order and gathered together to push their interests, which mostly coalesced around fighting any increase in the minimum wage. Jimmy Carter’s brother, Billy, was a news fixture representing the beleaguered small business, claiming to reporters, “Every time the minimum wage goes up, we have to lay off a few more people.” The Washington Post in the 1980s noted that politicians no longer thought of small business as weak and unorganized. “Members on both sides of the aisle recognize that small-business owners are numerous, well-organized and very combative,” the Post said. By the 1980s, the odd coalition had quickly raised a dormant idea to an American shibboleth. Reagan praised the “entrepreneur” 186 times in speeches, by one account. The irony, not entirely explored by either book, is that while the Reagan administration and every administration from then on was praising small business and the entrepreneur, they were also dismantling the antitrust regulations that kept large corporations restrained. They were talking out of both sides of their mouths, encouraging the growth and power of the massive corporations while symbolically propping up the little guy. It explains a core contradiction of the entrepreneur: why poster-boy businessmen who are bursting with entrepreneurial spirit (like a Mark Zuckerberg or a Steve Jobs) quickly became monopolists who then closed the door and dragged up the ladder on millions of future small-business owners. You can’t praise the entrepreneur, the self-starter, and the small business while doing nothing about the scourge of corporate concentration. This points to another issue of the promotion of small business and entrepreneurship: It doesn’t present a sound economic argument. As Waterhouse points out, even though politicians have come to recite the phrase “small business is the backbone of the economy” like it is the gospel, there is little evidence that it provides any more job growth or innovation than large corporations do. Most people work for medium- and large-scale enterprises. According to the 2019 census, over 60 percent of people work for companies with over 50 employees. Entrepreneurialism is not the lived experience of most Americans, nor should it be. “There is no economic evidence that a firm’s size has much to do with its economic success or its ability to create jobs,” Waterhouse writes. After the 1980s, he says later, “The notion that small business was the key to innovation and job creation ... became one of the most persistent myths of the late twentieth century.” In fact, as Waterhouse notes, a high degree of self-employment is a sign of an underperforming, ailing economy. Countries like Venezuela and Indonesia have three and four times the self-employment, and it isn’t helping. Typically, underdeveloped economies have far higher levels of self- and informal employment. In that light, the motto at early Apple, “90 Hours a Week and Loving It!” is less a sign of entrepreneurial success than of a struggling organization with unmanageable working hours for employees. So is the valorization of entrepreneurialism just a sunny spin on bad news—the ruling class trying to sell the declining economy as a fun and exciting new thing? It’s possible. It’s also possible that it is a response to the demand by workers for more from their bosses through collective action. Working hours have increased in the last four decades while wages have declined, something that we often celebrate when we celebrate the entrepreneur. It stunts our expectations because we can only look to ourselves and our own bodily limits for work. Can’t drive for Uber 120 hours a week? Then it’s your fault you’ll never pay back your student loans. The celebration of the entrepreneur also does not acknowledge that self-employment is often the only option for workers experiencing discrimination and low wages in the traditional workplace. People driving for Uber or running their own chain motel—often immigrants, women, and Black and brown workers—might have no other choice. The “adulation of scrappy entrepreneurs effectively normalized the unequal and oppressive conditions that pushed many people to business ownership in the first place,” Waterhouse writes. Individual risk-taking is not a solution for societywide problems like discrimination and unemployment. “In an era of massive global corporations, ever-expanding big-box stores, and high-flying finance, how did we decide that self-employment was the dream?” Waterhouse writes. One reason is that it pays lip service to a legitimate goal: freedom and autonomy that comes with democratic government. Much of the praise for small business or entrepreneurship is for the ways that it “eliminates” your boss and thus frees you from illegitimate, arbitrary authority, in the manner that early Americans hoped to emancipate themselves from the arbitrary authority of British rule. As one University of Texas management professor noted, the “figure of the entrepreneur stands tall in American folklore and history,” showing “how satisfying it would be to grab control of life, to be more than a wage slave, to make events happen instead of waiting for the world to move and shake us.” The entrepreneur takes control of their life. This is a worthy goal. However, it’s not clear how exactly small business and entrepreneurialism delivers this. “Putting all our faith in the promise of individual business ownership is both overly simplistic and a political smokescreen that blocks alternative visions to addressing social problems,” Waterhouse writes. Let’s say you’re an extraordinarily powerful person. You’re not, but let’s pretend. You’re a U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker type of person. You deliberately made U.S.-made goods expensive and foreign goods cheap in the 1980s by raising interest rates to previously unseen levels. This initiated a crisis that you knew would happen. Massive unemployment and stagnant wages would be your fault, and if regular people knew this, the entire edifice of the federal government’s political legitimacy could be called into question. But what if there was an ideology that suggested to large portions of the country that the crisis had not stemmed from the pens and keyboards of the ruling class but instead from the negative thoughts that workers themselves possessed? Aha! That their negative, non-entrepreneurial complacency caused it, as they work two—no three—jobs and commute four hours a day because they can’t afford a home near their work anymore. For every crisis initiated by ruling-class buffoonery or outright mendacity, an ideology that valorized the entrepreneur, the individual go-getter, the Johnny-on-the-spot, the hustler, the self-employed trickster God of Real Estate Financing would be a useful ideology for the winners of our social system. So what are we praising when we praise the self-employed and self-starting? Maybe it is more useful to think about what an entrepreneur is not. They are not people who own or run a business. In other words, they are the vast majority of people: employees. If we stretch the definition of “entrepreneur” to include employees who make their own work and never complain, there is another subcategory of people who are definitely not entrepreneurs: union members, organizers, and activists. Entrepreneurialism, by contrast, denigrates the lived experience of most Americans, by making their positions as employees non-praiseworthy. So how could we use the desire for autonomy that the entrepreneur suggests for egalitarian ends instead of atomizing and victim-blaming ones? We don’t need to be nostalgic for the era in which we worshipped big corps—the New Deal order left millions of farmworkers, domestic workers, Black and brown people, and women out of its benevolent umbrella—but we should also pick the ethos of cooperation and solidarity out of that time. To do so would require grassroots organizing, aided by vigorous antitrust enforcement that would break up monopolies and make it easier for workers to leverage their power. Universal health care and reliable unemployment benefits would untether workers from bad workplaces that stifle their autonomy. This way, people could easily quit bad jobs and start their own or find a better workplace. But the focus of autonomy needs to stay on the traditional workplace, because it affects the majority of people. To guarantee American freedom, we need to make the process of forming a union far easier, something that would allow people to change their workplaces for the better, or, better yet, carve out time away from work. The “creativity” that the valorization of entrepreneurship stresses could be put to use in finding ways for people to be happy in their lives, and to find meaning in their communities, instead of just finding ways to be more efficient at work.

Title: Shouting match erupts in Dewan Rakyat over PM and royal addendum

Monday, 17 Feb 2025 KUALA LUMPUR: A heated shouting match broke out in the Dewan Rakyat after Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal (PN-Machang) made critical remarks about Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and the royal addendum. Wan Ahmad Fayhsal accused Anwar of failing to attract investments and create high-quality jobs for Malaysians during the Parliament sitting on Monday. Citing World Bank data, he claimed that many Malaysian graduates had to work as e-hailing drivers, cashiers, and factory workers due to the lack of quality job opportunities. "Under Tambun (Anwar), Malaysia has failed to generate quality jobs. The rich are just cronies and capitalists,” he said, sparking objections from several MPs. Wan Ahmad Fayhsal also called for the Public Accounts Committee to investigate the privatisation of Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB), alleging that the sale of MAHB shares was linked to investment firm BlackRock. Tensions escalated further when he brought up the royal addendum related to former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s house arrest. Deputy Speaker Syahredzan Johan intervened, stopping Wan Ahmad Fayhsal from continuing and referring to Speaker Tan Sri Johari Abdul’s previous ruling that the royal addendum could not be debated in the House. "If you're not satisfied, please submit a motion to challenge the ruling. As of now, I am not allowing it," he said, while also reminding MPs to follow proper procedures when interjecting during debates. He then issued a first warning to Wan Ahmad Fayhsal, who was previously suspended for six months in July last year, causing him to miss the last Dewan Rakyat session. Thank you for your report!

Title: The Rainmakers: Meet the 20 bankers who led last year's M&A rebound, driving billions in fees to their firms

If you were to describe dealmaking in 2024, you might say it's the year Wall Street got its swagger back. US companies announced more than $1.43 trillion in deals last year, the highest amount since 2021, when a dealmaking frenzy resulted in a record $2.51 trillion in US M&A activity, according to the deals tracker LSEG. The uptick — combined with signs of economic growth and a more relaxed approach to regulations under the Trump administration — has led some industry leaders to suggest that the M&A freeze that started in 2022 may finally be coming to an end. "There's a lot of pent-up energy in capital markets, particularly around the financial-sponsor community, and that will be unleashed," David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, said at a financial industry conference in February. "I am very confident we will get back to 10-year averages" in historical dealmaking contexts, he said, adding, "This year could be one of those times." Bankers have good reason to be hopeful: There were 96 megadeals, or deals over $5 billion, announced globally last year — the most since 2021, according to LSEG. Such deals are the lifeblood of the biggest investment banks as they can generate hundreds of billions in fees for firms. Last year's M&A activity generated advisory fees of about $33.4 billion, a 7% increase from roughly $31.3 billion the year before, LSEG said. Some of the multibillion-dollar tie-ups facilitated by the battle-hardened M&A bankers on this year's list included the nearly $36 billion sale of the food manufacturer Kellanova to the snack brand Mars and the $26 billion takeover of Endeavor Energy Resources by its rival Diamondback Energy. To find out which bankers helped their firms benefit from last year's boom, Business Insider partnered with MergerLinks, a UK-based data provider that reviews M&A performance, to present the sixth annual edition of "The Rainmakers," a list of the top 20 investment bankers ranked by overall transaction volume in the US. This is the first year a woman — Anu Aiyengar of JPMorgan — has snagged the No. 1 spot. It's also the first time more than one woman has made the ranking. Aiyengar, JPMorgan's global head of mergers and acquisitions, was joined by Lily Mahdavi, who was recently promoted to cohead of M&A in the Americas at Morgan Stanley. It's Aiyengar's fourth appearance. Other repeat names include Suhail Sikhtian, who leads Goldman's natural-resources practice; Blair Effron, a cofounder of the elite-boutique investment bank Centerview; and Stephan Feldgoise, Goldman Sachs' head of M&A. More notable, perhaps, are the unusually high number of new faces — including Mahdavi and her fellow Morgan Stanley dealmaker Steve Munger. Also new to the list are Centerview's Todd Davison, Jefferies' Conrad Gibbins, and Xavier Loriferne of JPMorgan Chase. In total, nearly 50% of the members on this year's list — nine names — are making their inaugural debut, MergerLinks said. The 2024 list also marks the first time a Jefferies banker has made the top 20. MergerLinks tracks publicly announced deals and calculates deal values on a net basis, including both equity and debt components. To make the individual league table, a banker must have been the lead advisor on either side of a transaction. Deal sizes are sourced from MergerLinks and public press releases and include the target company's net debt. The transaction values are converted from British pounds to US dollars at the average 2024 exchange rate. As a result, some deal prices announced in dollars throughout the year may not match up. Title: Global head of M&A Number of deals: 14 Value of deals: $83.2 billion Aiyengar became JPMorgan's solo head of mergers and acquisitions in 2023 but has been with the bank since 2002. She's routinely cited as one of the financial services industry's most powerful and influential female leaders. She has appeared on the list three times in the past. Her 2024 deals included: Advised Rio Tinto, a global mining organization, its $6.7 billion acquisition of the chemicals firm Arcadium Lithium. Title: Global head of M&A Number of deals: 7 Value of deals: $78.2 billion Feldgoise was named Goldman's global head of mergers and acquisitions following a management reshuffle of its investment banking division in January. Feldgoise was previously a cohead of M&A and has also led the investment bank's consumer and retail coverage group. He joined the firm in 1997 and became a partner in 2008. This is his second time on the list, with his first appearance being two years ago. His 2024 deals included: Advised the data center firm AirTrunk in its roughly $15 billion sale to the private equity firm Blackstone. Title: CEO Number of deals: 7 Value of deals: $76.2 billion Boutros is the CEO of the tech-focused investment bank Qatalyst. Previously, he was a senior banker at Credit Suisse, where he served as chairman of both the global technology and healthcare groups. Qatalyst says he has completed more than 700 transactions of various types over the years. This is his fourth year in a row on the Rainmakers list. His 2024 deals included: Title: Chairman of global M&A Number of deals: 5 Value of deals: $74.2 billion Munger has been a Morgan Stanley banker for nearly 40 years and chairman of its M&A group for two decades. This is Munger's first time on the Rainmakers list. His 2024 deals included: Title: Managing director, head of FIG M&A, cohead of media & communications M&A Number of deals: 10 Value of deals: $70.9 billion Loriferne joined JPMorgan in 2006. This marks Loriferne's first time on the Rainmakers list. His 2024 deals included: Title: Partner Number of deals: 4 Value of deals: $63.2 billion Davison is a partner at Centerview and has been an investment banker for more than 25 years. This is his first time appearing on the list. He joined Centerview in 2013 to cohead its media practice and was previously a cohead of North American media coverage at Morgan Stanley. Centerview says he's been involved in more than $300 billion worth of transactions throughout his career. His 2024 deals included: Title: Cohead of M&A, Americas Number of deals: 9 Value of deals: $59.6 billion Mahdavi, who has spent the entirety of her career focused on mergers and acquisitions, joined Morgan Stanley in 2012; she was previously at Deutsche Bank and Citi. She was promoted to co-lead the M&A business in the Americas in early 2025. This is Mahdavi's first time on the Rainmakers list. Her 2024 deals included: Title: Cochairman of global mergers and acquisitions Number of deals: 8 Value of deals: $59.2 billion Ingrassia was previously head of Americas M&A at Goldman, a role he held since 2004. Previously, he ran the consumer retail group. He has appeared multiple times on the Rainmakers list, including last year and the year prior. His 2024 deals included: Title: Vice chairman of investment banking Number of deals: 7 Value of deals: $51.3 billion This is Gallea's third time on the list. Gallea joined Goldman Sachs from JPMorgan in 2018 after spending nearly two decades there. He has distinguished himself as a leading banker in the industrials sector. His 2024 deals included: Title: Chairman of global M&A Number of deals: 6 Value of deals: $49.8 billion The longtime global M&A leader moved into a new role as chairman last year so he could spend more time advising Barclays' top clients. Posternack joined the firm in 2008 after it bought Lehman Brothers, his previous firm. He led its natural-resources practice and its M&A takeover defense business. He became head of M&A worldwide in 2014. His 2024 deals included: Title: Global head of natural-resources investment banking Number of deals: 3 Value of deals: $45.9 billion Sikhtian became Goldman's sole head of natural-resources investment banking in 2020. He's been with the firm since 1998, when he started in the energy and power group. He has also worked with European energy companies from London. He made his first appearance on the list last year. His 2024 deals included: Title: Global chairman of investment banking and mergers and acquisitions Number of deals: 14 Value of deals: $45.1 billion Ventresca, a three-decade veteran of JPMorgan, has advised on mandates spanning industrials, telecoms, consumer retail, and more. He appeared on the Rainmakers list for the first time last year. His 2024 deals included: Title: Managing director Number of deals: 10 Value of deals: $44.5 billion This year marks Gibbins' first appearance on the list. The banker, who's based in Texas and concentrates on the energy sector, joined Jefferies as an analyst nearly 15 years ago. Since late 2022, he's served as Jefferies' cohead of Upstream in the Americas and a managing director. His 2024 deals included: Title: Global chairman, mergers and acquisitions Number of deals: 5 Value of deals: $43.6 billion Rajkovic joined JPMorgan from Barclays in 2011 as the head of technology mergers and acquisitions and has since risen to serve as a global chairman of M&A at the firm, led by CEO Jamie Dimon (shown above). At Barclays, Rajkovic led tech M&A as well. It's his first time on the list. His 2024 deals included: Title: Senior managing director and cohead of US investment banking Number of deals: 5 Value of deals: $40.8 billion Nataraj, who has been at Evercore since 2002, is a member of the firm's management committee and a top banker in its technology, media, and telecommunications business. He has advised on more than $600 billion worth of transactions, the company says. His first appearance on the list was in 2022. His 2024 deals included: Title: Senior managing director Number of deals: 4 Value of deals: $40.1 billion Ward has advised on more than $450 billion worth of M&A transactions, Evercore says, and is one of the industry's top energy bankers — this is his second year in a row on the Rainmakers list. Before joining Evercore, Ward led the global natural-resources investment banking business at Deutsche Bank. His 2024 deals included: Title: Partner Number of deals: 2 Value of deals: $38.2 billion Benedetti has been a senior banker with PWP since 2009, joining from Morgan Stanley, where he started his career in 1991. It's his first time on the list. His 2024 deals included: Title: Managing director and global head of consumer, retail, and leisure Number of deals: 2 Value of deals: $37 billion Taetle is a first-timer on the Rainmakers list, but he's a veteran dealmaker with consumer and retail firms such as Campbell's and Keurig Dr Pepper. He started his career with Goldman Sachs in the 1990s and has since held senior leadership roles at Barclays and Evercore, which he joined in 2018 to co-lead its consumer retail group. He left Evercore earlier this year, taking a top role with Lazard in June. His 2024 deals included: Title: Partner Number of deals: 2 Value of deals: $35.8 billion This year marks Freudenstein's first time on the list. He joined PJT in 2017, having previously worked at JPMorgan in various roles. Those positions ranged from deputy head of Americas equity research to JPMorgan's head of market structure and asset management, and an investment banker focused on deals in the financial-services sector, before he left for PJT. The firm was founded by the former top Morgan Stanley executive Paul Taubman, shown above. Freudenstein's 2024 deals included: Title: Cofounder and partner Number of deals: 5 Value of deals: $34.6 billion Effron cofounded Centerview in 2006 and built it into an influential name in investment banking, with more than 350 employees in the US and UK.

I’m not in this business anymore but it looks to me like this represents a sea change from the personal microprocessor to the server-level AI/cloud. I hope not. I want all my computing to belong to me, including the damned software. I can’t begin to express my contempt for the way Adobe is ripping off its customers renting software under new “licenses” that is functionally identical to what I bought 15 years ago. I was a beta tester on Photoshop 0.1B (still have 3.5" floppy sent to me by John Knoll, which might be worth something), so I too have been a long-time Adobe customer. I agree outside of the generative AI functionality (which is buggy and not much more use than magic wand) Photoshop hasn't really improved much in the past 10 years. “Pathetic. How could Intel be so tone deaf to the market over the last 30 years to actually be going bankrupt?” I think one element is that they have been waiting, and waiting, and waiting, for the CHIPS act to kick in. “The CHIPS and Science Act is a U.S. law enacted in 2022 that provides approximately $280 billion to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research, aiming to strengthen the U.S. supply chain and compete with China. It includes significant funding for chip manufacturing, research, and workforce development.” Government largess became their strategy. It’s almost like doing poorly at a sport, counting on favorable draft selections to make you whole. Corporate welfare, like any welfare, is a destructive “sure thing.” I have Photoshop 13. So far, they haven't wrecked that, but it's no more functional than the CS2 version I had. Where they've really got me is with Acrobat, in which I have an enormous investment. By the late 90’s Intel already had a reputation as a H1B sweat shop. These H1B junior engineers from the 90’s and 2000’s now occupy the vast majority of Intel’s middle and upper management.

There are ways to get around this, such as using Thunderbird to open the file and creating a new archive based on the mbox format. This initial conversion can only be done on Windows because it uses a built-in mail API to access the information, but once you have converted the archive it should be accessible by most email tools, both on Windows and Linux.

I can’t begin to express my contempt for the way Adobe is ripping off its customers renting software under new “licenses” that is functionally identical to what I bought 15 years ago. I was a beta tester on Photoshop 0.1B (still have 3.5" floppy sent to me by John Knoll, which might be worth something), so I too have been a long-time Adobe customer. I agree outside of the generative AI functionality (which is buggy and not much more use than magic wand) Photoshop hasn't really improved much in the past 10 years. “Pathetic. How could Intel be so tone deaf to the market over the last 30 years to actually be going bankrupt?” I think one element is that they have been waiting, and waiting, and waiting, for the CHIPS act to kick in. “The CHIPS and Science Act is a U.S. law enacted in 2022 that provides approximately $280 billion to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research, aiming to strengthen the U.S. supply chain and compete with China. It includes significant funding for chip manufacturing, research, and workforce development.” Government largess became their strategy. It’s almost like doing poorly at a sport, counting on favorable draft selections to make you whole. Corporate welfare, like any welfare, is a destructive “sure thing.” I have Photoshop 13. So far, they haven't wrecked that, but it's no more functional than the CS2 version I had. Where they've really got me is with Acrobat, in which I have an enormous investment. By the late 90’s Intel already had a reputation as a H1B sweat shop. These H1B junior engineers from the 90’s and 2000’s now occupy the vast majority of Intel’s middle and upper management. Numerous White engineers laid off to pay exec salaries. Expect other tech companies to follow the same trajectory.

Top answer All answers (5) The .PST file is a proprietary format, and AFAIK, can only be used by Microsoft products. There are ways to get around this, such as using Thunderbird to open the file and creating a new archive based on the mbox format. This initial conversion can only be done on Windows because it uses a built-in mail API to access the information, but once you have converted the archive it should be accessible by most email tools, both on Windows and Linux. Answer from chills42 on superuser.com https://www.sysinfotools.com/linux/pst-converter.php Thanks, I'll take a look. I purchased a software product specifically dedicated to that end. It failed to generate a usable output, I think because of the file size. I have parted out portions of the Outlook.pst to archive files to run through that app, but haven't done it yet.

UPDATED 18:28 EST / FEBRUARY 16 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and David Floyer Few brands in technology carry the storied pedigree of Intel Corp. For decades, “Intel Inside” was synonymous with progress in computing — an American icon that repeatedly raised the bar for processor performance and innovation. Today, Intel finds itself in a precarious position. Its once-vaunted manufacturing machine has fallen behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., which dominates advanced process nodes. Meanwhile, Intel’s core central processing unit design business — a substantial, if bruised, revenue engine — remains overshadowed by the mounting losses and capital burn in its foundry operations. Reports swirl that Broadcom Inc. might step in and scoop up Intel’s design arm. But for those who believe in competition, national security and the long-term integrity of an American technology brand, that outcome would be deeply misguided. In this Special Breaking Analysis, we examine why Intel’s design business can — and should — remain an independent powerhouse once the company spins out its foundry operations. We’ll walk through how a spinout might unfold, including an updated scenario from our original bold plan in which TSMC anchors a U.S.-domiciled joint venture. We’ll also detail why the foundry must command a massive discount — perhaps as deep as 90% to 100% of Intel’s sunk investment — and how a “take-or-pay” wafer pre-purchase model from hyperscale cloud providers (Amazon Web Services Inc., Google LLC, Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Nvidia Corp.) can sustain a new American-based foundry while freeing Intel to focus on design excellence. Along the way, we’ll explore the role of advanced nodes such as Intel’s much-touted 18A, and dissect why we feel the assumptions of intellectual property value around 18A might not be as viable as the pundits say. We hope to convey why all these moves serve a broader purpose: to maintain robust competition, fortify national security and preserve an American chip design champion. Intel’s integrated manufacturing strategy was once a key differentiator. By aligning design and process technology in tandem, Intel could produce new microprocessors at a pace the rest of the industry struggled to match. But TSMC’s rise — fueled by enormous wafer volumes from Arm-based mobile processors and an unwavering focus on manufacturing excellence — has left Intel behind in advanced process nodes. The capital intensity of staying competitive at the leading edge has skyrocketed, and Intel’s foundry efforts have yet to attract sufficient scale or external customers. Pat Gelsinger’s return as chief executive initially reignited optimism for a U.S.-based advanced manufacturing renaissance. But the delays in Intel’s roadmap, the cost overruns in ramping new nodes, and the persistence of TSMC’s leadership suggest that Intel’s foundry plan remains outgunned. Meanwhile, the design side of Intel’s house — responsible for everything from x86 CPUs for PCs and servers to emerging artificial intelligence accelerators — still has enormous potential. The problem is that this potential remains shackled by the continuous drain of Intel’s foundry ambitions. For more context, read our Critical Analysis on the Root Cause of Intel’s Troubles. Reports of Broadcom acquiring Intel’s design business reflect a short-term mindset. Broadcom has built its empire through acquisition, focusing on cost efficiencies and leveraging synergies across enterprise software, networking and semiconductors. Intel in many ways would fit Broadcom’s strategy of acquiring durable businesses. Handing over Intel’s CPU design business — a bedrock of American microprocessor leadership — would inevitably concentrate more market power. That’s not only a threat to healthy competition; it risks overshadowing Intel’s legacy and future innovation. Given the heightened scrutiny on tech mergers and acquisitions by both U.S. and international regulators, a Broadcom-Intel design merger could and should face drawn-out investigations or outright rejection. Moreover, Intel’s stock price is depressed compared with historical peaks, in no small part because of the drag from manufacturing. Why sell the design arm now, when it’s arguably at a cyclical low? Once the foundry baggage is removed and Intel’s design group can stand on its own merits — much like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. did when it spun off GlobalFoundries — there’s every possibility for a resurgence. Selling at the bottom of the cycle would shortchange shareholders and kill an iconic brand that still has real technological capital. Intel’s board owes it to shareholders, employees and the broader tech industry to keep the design business independent. Yes, the integrated manufacturing approach has proven costly, and yes, the foundry is likely a negative-value asset as it stands. But there is precedent for this kind of strategic realignment: IBM Corp. paid GlobalFoundries to take its microelectronics division in 2014. AMD separated its fabs in 2009 and eventually became a formidable design-centric competitor. Today, AMD relies on TSMC to manufacture its designs at leading-edge nodes. With the money drain from manufacturing gone, AMD could focus on architectural innovation — an effort that has paid off handsomely. In the same vein, Intel can rebuild its design brand and engineering culture once it is liberated from the massive overhead of running advanced-node fabs. The board shouldn’t tap out and sell the design side to a competitor; it should step up and ensure that an iconic American brand continues to innovate in CPUs, graphics processing units, AI and custom silicon markets. Intel in our view has no choice but to exit manufacturing. To spin out foundry will likely require a substantial discount — some might even call it “paying someone to take it off their hands.” In 2014, IBM effectively wrote GlobalFoundries a large check to absorb its microelectronics business, transferring factories, employees and IP. Intel’s foundry operations have consumed billions in capital with underwhelming yields and missed process milestones. Critics may point to 18A as a potential game-changer, but the reality is that 18A is behind schedule, unproven and not generating revenue. To entice a partner such as TSMC to operate these fabs in the U.S., Intel must accept that much of its capital investment will not be recovered. A 90% to 100% discount relative to the book value of Intel’s foundry assets may sound extreme, yet it’s not unprecedented when the alternative is ongoing, multibillion-dollar losses. This is the cost of a strategic reset. Intel has touted 18A as the company’s hope to leapfrog TSMC. But each roadmap slip erodes market confidence and 18A’s negative profitability was never going to allow Intel to catch TSMC with this node. The deeper truth is that the real wave of future manufacturing innovation was more likely with what Intel calls 14A (or some iteration of that node) — combining backside power delivery, gate-all-around and next-generation High-NA EUV in a more mature process window. We’ve always said this was an extremely risky and unproven endeavor but in the unlikely event Intel could pull it off, it would have likely represented a leapfrog in process relative to TSMC. But the probability of success in a reasonable timeframe was always very low. However, 14A in the JV’s hands under TSMC’s guidance would likely be more fruitful. Because it has profitable advanced nodes already, it could take its time with 14A rather than trying to catch up in desperation. TSMC has the financial and operational discipline to integrate new techniques properly. If TSMC is part of a U.S.-domiciled JV, it can exercise that discipline on what remains of Intel’s advanced node R&D while leveraging some of Intel’s IP. In this scenario, 14A would find a more reliable steward in TSMC than Intel’s own cash-strapped and time-pressured foundry operation. The likely scenario is a joint venture — wholly based in the United States — where TSMC contributes expertise, intellectual property and skilled engineering teams deployed stateside. Unlike typical equity investments, TSMC might not contribute much upfront cash. Instead, it would bring intangible but invaluable process know-how, yield ramp experience and world-class manufacturing talent. The U.S. government’s CHIPS Act funds could partially offset capital expenses, while private equity players provide debt financing backstopped by either Washington or the JV’s assets. Under this arrangement, Intel’s foundry assets and workforce transfer to the JV. TSMC becomes the majority stakeholder or at least the primary operator, ensuring that day-to-day manufacturing decisions align with TSMC’s methodology. Intel, for its part, might retain a minority stake but cede operational control — effectively paying to hand over the reins to the world’s most competent foundry operator. The discount on Intel’s assets is baked into the deal; it reflects the expensive truth that Intel’s fabs have negative economic value unless someone can turn them around. Below is a revised and simplified version of our original CAP table: One of the greatest hurdles for a newly spun-out foundry is securing enough volume to achieve economies of scale. TSMC thrives on huge wafer starts from Apple, MediaTek Inc., AMD, Nvidia and many others. Intel’s x86 business alone won’t provide the necessary volume, especially if it’s behind TSMC’s own leading-edge processes. So, the solution is to bring in the U.S. hyperscalers — AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Nvidia, the U.S. military and others — that each have a vested interest in: By structuring multiyear “take-or-pay” wafer pre-purchase contracts, the hyperscalers guarantee consistent demand regardless of yield ramp challenges. This arrangement underwrites the JV’s operational costs during the toughest early years. The “take-or-pay” concept means that if yields remain low or the node is behind TSMC’s mainstream lines for a while, these cloud giants still pay for the capacity. In return, they get guaranteed supply when (and if) the JV’s yields improve, plus the political goodwill of being seen as partners in securing U.S. semiconductor independence. The crux of this model is that the guaranteed demand from hyperscalers offsets the typical scale disadvantage a new foundry would face. This approach also dovetails with the government’s desire to see advanced node manufacturing thrive on U.S. soil, thereby reducing national security risks tied to any instability in Asia. The internet giants are placing large, multiyear bets on American silicon. But it’s not a classic equity investment. Instead, each of these firms would be committing to substantial “take-or-pay” wafer agreements, locking in critical supply for advanced semiconductors without the long wait for a traditional equity return on investment. In exchange, the U.S. government would take its foot off the necks of these companies in the form of relaxed regulatory pressure and onerous oversight. For years, Apple and the hyperscalers have relied almost exclusively on TSMC’s Taiwanese fabs. That’s understandable — TSMC is the gold standard in advanced node manufacturing. But rising geopolitical tensions underscore the risk of tying all capacity to a single region. By participating in a new U.S.-based JV, these companies gain a dependable second source for high-performance chips, hedging against sudden disruptions. From iPhone systems-on-chip to AI accelerators, every hyperscaler wants an uninterrupted flow of silicon. Being first to market with new AI and machine learning capabilities or next-generation consumer devices can mean the difference between industry leadership and playing catch-up. A domestic advanced node foundry, even if initially lagging TSMC’s bleeding edge by a half-step, gives these firms a crucial foothold in American-made chips — a prospect that has become priceless. What do these hyperscalers get beyond supply assurance? A more predictable regulatory climate. In Washington, the appetite to scrutinize Big Tech — whether over antitrust, privacy or monopolistic practices — has only grown. Committing massive wafer prepayments to a strategic U.S. foundry aligns their corporate goals with the government’s national interests. By no means are we suggesting these firms get a total regulatory pass. But the sheer scale of their take-or-pay deals supports America’s push for domestic semiconductor leadership, buying goodwill and tempering how aggressively regulators wield the antitrust hammer. For these companies, predictability in the legal arena translates into billions of dollars in strategic value. Moreover, the U.S. government in our scenario would pressure EU regulators to back off as well, in exchange for a more stable supply chain for advanced silicon. Since the U.S. is funding the future of silicon, it has the moral authority to pressure EU regulators to moderate their anti-Big Tech stance against U.S. companies. By opting for wafer guarantees rather than equity stakes, the hyperscalers sidestep the classic venture capital pitfall of waiting a decade for payback. Every one of these companies is in constant need of leading-edge silicon; paying upfront for guaranteed capacity isn’t just a hedge, it’s an essential input to their day-to-day business. So unlike a typical long-horizon investment, these wafer commitments deliver near-term strategic value: a stable supply of advanced chips to fuel growth in AI, cloud services, consumer devices and more. In return, the new foundry scores sustained demand. Even if early yields lag behind TSMC’s global best, the arrangement smooths out the revenue cycle while the JV works to improve yield and process maturity. It’s a symbiotic setup: Big Tech gets supply and the foundry gets a stable customer base and a realistic shot at scale. Apple Apple has long been TSMC’s shining star, but a single point of manufacturing failure is no longer tenable. Diversifying to a domestic foundry paves the way for second-source security across iPhone, iPad and Mac chips. Over the long haul, Apple might also co-develop next-gen packaging lines at the JV, ensuring it retains a competitive edge in device performance. AWS AWS is hungry for capacity for its Graviton CPUs, Trainium and Inferentia AI chips, plus whatever HPC solutions loom on the horizon. And there’s a regulatory carrot: If Amazon helps secure U.S. semiconductor leadership, the government will commit to soften scrutiny around its e-commerce dominance. Google Google Cloud’s TPU programs demand advanced silicon to power AI/ML workloads at large scale. A domestic foundry removes the uncertainty of Taiwanese supply lines and the U.S. government would agree to lessen its scrutiny around data privacy or large-scale acquisitions. Predictability here is priceless for a company whose approach is “move fast and innovate.” Microsoft Microsoft’s diverse product suite spans cloud hardware, AI chips (Project Athena) and even Xbox SoCs. A stake in U.S.-based capacity can deflect the usual antitrust chatter around Office and Windows bundling. The real boon is ensuring timely access to advanced nodes for its AI and console businesses. Meta Meta faces heavy scrutiny on social media policy and data privacy. Securing advanced-node chips for AI inference, training, and upcoming AR/VR headsets is mission-critical. Making big wafer commitments demonstrates goodwill that could soften regulators’ stances on everything from user data to content moderation. Nvidia As the go-to provider of GPUs for AI and gaming, Nvidia constantly grapples with supply shortages — and no one knows that better than data center customers. Having a domestic fab option helps shield against overseas risk and further ingratiates Nvidia to U.S. policymakers, potentially smoothing the road for future expansions or acquisitions. Additional stakeholders in this model could include the U.S. military, Qualcomm Inc., Tesla Inc., MediaTek, AMD and possibly IBM, which could also contribute IP from its advanced research in chips. A U.S.-based advanced foundry JV, underpinned by these massive “take-or-pay” agreements, is more than a financial arrangement. It’s an ecosystem-level deal that ties the fortunes of Big Tech to America’s semiconductor resurgence. Each hyperscaler hedges against global uncertainty and gains a modicum of regulatory relief in the process. Meanwhile, the JV secures guaranteed demand from day one — enough to build momentum toward competitive yields, node maturity and long-term viability. In short, this is a bet on stability — geopolitical, operational and regulatory — and at a time when advanced silicon has become the oil of the digital economy. We believe that’s an investment well worth making. Total Upfront Payments: $25 billion Total Milestone Payments: $19 billion Grand Total: $44 billion (over five years) Note: These figures are illustrative to show a hypothetical scale. They should be adjusted based on overall fab construction costs, negotiated TSMC licensing fees, and a reasonable node volume. This structure gives the new American Foundry approximately $100 billion in capital over a five-year period. With TSMC’s leadership, process expertise and talent injection it dramatically increases the chances of having a viable advanced semiconductor manufacturing source on U.S. shores with a U.S.-domiciled company. Once the foundry is spun out, Intel can refocus on its core: designing innovative CPUs, GPUs, AI accelerators and custom silicon solutions. By removing the financial and managerial overhead of manufacturing, Intel’s leadership can redeploy cash toward R&D in architecture, software stacks, packaging innovation and go-to-market partnerships. A streamlined Intel might look a lot like AMD, Nvidia or Qualcomm — fabless (or fab-lite) — yet able to bring advanced chip designs to market quickly by tapping TSMC’s best processes. Intel could still have preferential access to the newly created JV, securing capacity for its own x86 lines at better rates or guaranteed volumes. But if that JV lags TSMC’s mainline by too much, Intel’s design arm could also choose to go direct to TSMC’s Taiwan fabs or Samsung’s foundries. This freedom would be an enormous boost to Intel’s competitiveness. No longer chained to a sub-scale manufacturing model, Intel design engineers can choose whichever advanced node best suits the product timeline and competitive environment. An independent Intel design division also satisfies the concerns of regulators who fear large-scale consolidation. Selling the design arm to Broadcom would add to the wave of semiconductor M&A that the government is already carefully scrutinizing. By staying independent, Intel remains a distinct competitor in CPU, HPC and AI markets. The U.S. Department of Defense also gains because Intel can keep focusing on specialized designs for defense-related applications, while the new JV foundry (with TSMC stewardship) handles secure manufacturing on American soil. It’s a synergy that retains critical R&D in the United States, fosters multiple points of competition, and ensures a stable supply chain for military and civilian infrastructure. TSMC has already broken ground on fabs in Arizona, though it has struggled with costs and workforce challenges. Critics question whether TSMC will allocate its best technology to U.S. sites. In the proposed JV scenario, TSMC could opt to transfer a slightly older node to ensure it retains absolute leadership in Taiwan. The new entity might operate at “N-1” levels of technology. Yet for many hyperscaler workloads — such as server CPUs, AI inference chips or specialized accelerators — being a generation behind might be acceptable when weighed against the security of local supply. Over a decade, with guaranteed volume and financial stability, that JV could close some of the gap if TSMC invests in incremental process improvements. One could argue that the U.S. government wants Intel to succeed as a standalone integrated manufacturer. But the repeated delays and huge losses reveal that Intel won’t ever catch up to TSMC alone (without unlimited capital and time). The CHIPS Act aims to ensure advanced node capacity exists in the U.S., not necessarily that Intel remains integrated if that model is doomed to fail. A TSMC-led JV, operating on U.S. soil, employing tens of thousands of Americans, and financed partly by Big Tech’s wafer prepayments, meets the spirit of the CHIPS Act. For the government, it’s a pragmatic solution to ensure advanced manufacturing doesn’t vanish entirely from American shores. A valid concern is that Intel might lose its “co-optimization” advantage by spinning out manufacturing. But the success of AMD, Nvidia and Apple’s silicon team indicates that close partnerships with TSMC can achieve better results than a sub-scale in-house approach. Intel’s advanced packaging technologies (such as EMIB and Foveros) can be licensed to or co-developed with TSMC under commercial agreements. As an independent design entity, Intel can become more nimble, not less. Take-or-pay contracts assume that advanced node yields will improve over time. Early yields might be poor. The hyperscalers, however, get two things they value: guaranteed capacity (even if it’s behind TSMC’s leading edge) and better regulatory standing with the government. Over the long haul, if yields are too low and the JV fails, the hyperscalers would still have TSMC’s mainline in Taiwan (or Samsung) as a fallback. Because these are multiyear deals, the JV has enough runway to fix process issues, guided by TSMC’s real-world experience. Rather than ceding its legacy to Broadcom or any other suitor, Intel should embrace a strategic pivot that upholds competition, national security and the spirit of American innovation. The steps are clear, albeit not easy: Intel’s board is under pressure to deliver shareholder value in the wake of ongoing foundry failures. Selling Intel’s design business to Broadcom might look like a quick fix, but it would sacrifice a venerable American brand at the lowest point of its valuation — an outcome that undermines competition, national security and the legacy of one of tech’s greatest innovators. We believe it is incumbent on this board, which oversaw the flawed IDM 2.0 strategy, to preserve Intel as an independent entity and support the hard work it will take to give rebirth to this American icon. The visionary and entirely viable route is to spin out the foundry, swallow the painful discount, and let Intel’s design house flourish independently. We’ve seen the positive results of such a strategy with AMD, which soared after distancing itself from foundry headaches. With a TSMC-led joint venture offering a U.S.-based alternative to Taiwan’s facilities — and hyperscalers incentivized to prepay for wafer volume — this scenario provides a lifeline for advanced semiconductor manufacturing in America. It keeps Intel relevant in the CPU, GPU and AI arenas. It aligns with government aims for robust competition and supply chain security. And it ensures that “Intel Inside” remains more than just a memory. In short, Intel’s next chapter need not be defined by a desperate sale to a conglomerate. The foundry spinout is a bitter pill, but once swallowed, it could liberate Intel’s design prowess for decades to come — reestablishing it as a powerhouse of American innovation, sustaining competition across the CPU and AI markets, and serving as a keystone in the broader effort to restore domestic semiconductor manufacturing leadership. It’s a vision that demands courage from Intel’s board, patience from its shareholders, and cooperation from the U.S. government and partners like TSMC and the hyperscalers — but one that could ultimately salvage Intel’s future as an iconic force in technology.

We’ve always said this was an extremely risky and unproven endeavor but in the unlikely event Intel could pull it off, it would have likely represented a leapfrog in process relative to TSMC. But the probability of success in a reasonable timeframe was always very low. However, 14A in the JV’s hands under TSMC’s guidance would likely be more fruitful. Because it has profitable advanced nodes already, it could take its time with 14A rather than trying to catch up in desperation. TSMC has the financial and operational discipline to integrate new techniques properly. If TSMC is part of a U.S.-domiciled JV, it can exercise that discipline on what remains of Intel’s advanced node R&D while leveraging some of Intel’s IP. In this scenario, 14A would find a more reliable steward in TSMC than Intel’s own cash-strapped and time-pressured foundry operation. The likely scenario is a joint venture — wholly based in the United States — where TSMC contributes expertise, intellectual property and skilled engineering teams deployed stateside. Unlike typical equity investments, TSMC might not contribute much upfront cash. Instead, it would bring intangible but invaluable process know-how, yield ramp experience and world-class manufacturing talent. The U.S. government’s CHIPS Act funds could partially offset capital expenses, while private equity players provide debt financing backstopped by either Washington or the JV’s assets. Under this arrangement, Intel’s foundry assets and workforce transfer to the JV. TSMC becomes the majority stakeholder or at least the primary operator, ensuring that day-to-day manufacturing decisions align with TSMC’s methodology. Intel, for its part, might retain a minority stake but cede operational control — effectively paying to hand over the reins to the world’s most competent foundry operator. The discount on Intel’s assets is baked into the deal; it reflects the expensive truth that Intel’s fabs have negative economic value unless someone can turn them around. Below is a revised and simplified version of our original CAP table: One of the greatest hurdles for a newly spun-out foundry is securing enough volume to achieve economies of scale. TSMC thrives on huge wafer starts from Apple, MediaTek Inc., AMD, Nvidia and many others. Intel’s x86 business alone won’t provide the necessary volume, especially if it’s behind TSMC’s own leading-edge processes. So, the solution is to bring in the U.S. hyperscalers — AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Nvidia, the U.S. military and others — that each have a vested interest in: By structuring multiyear “take-or-pay” wafer pre-purchase contracts, the hyperscalers guarantee consistent demand regardless of yield ramp challenges. This arrangement underwrites the JV’s operational costs during the toughest early years. The “take-or-pay” concept means that if yields remain low or the node is behind TSMC’s mainstream lines for a while, these cloud giants still pay for the capacity. In return, they get guaranteed supply when (and if) the JV’s yields improve, plus the political goodwill of being seen as partners in securing U.S. semiconductor independence. The crux of this model is that the guaranteed demand from hyperscalers offsets the typical scale disadvantage a new foundry would face. This approach also dovetails with the government’s desire to see advanced node manufacturing thrive on U.S. soil, thereby reducing national security risks tied to any instability in Asia. The internet giants are placing large, multiyear bets on American silicon. But it’s not a classic equity investment. Instead, each of these firms would be committing to substantial “take-or-pay” wafer agreements, locking in critical supply for advanced semiconductors without the long wait for a traditional equity return on investment. In exchange, the U.S. government would take its foot off the necks of these companies in the form of relaxed regulatory pressure and onerous oversight. For years, Apple and the hyperscalers have relied almost exclusively on TSMC’s Taiwanese fabs. That’s understandable — TSMC is the gold standard in advanced node manufacturing. But rising geopolitical tensions underscore the risk of tying all capacity to a single region. By participating in a new U.S.-based JV, these companies gain a dependable second source for high-performance chips, hedging against sudden disruptions. From iPhone systems-on-chip to AI accelerators, every hyperscaler wants an uninterrupted flow of silicon. Being first to market with new AI and machine learning capabilities or next-generation consumer devices can mean the difference between industry leadership and playing catch-up. A domestic advanced node foundry, even if initially lagging TSMC’s bleeding edge by a half-step, gives these firms a crucial foothold in American-made chips — a prospect that has become priceless. What do these hyperscalers get beyond supply assurance? A more predictable regulatory climate. In Washington, the appetite to scrutinize Big Tech — whether over antitrust, privacy or monopolistic practices — has only grown. Committing massive wafer prepayments to a strategic U.S. foundry aligns their corporate goals with the government’s national interests. By no means are we suggesting these firms get a total regulatory pass. But the sheer scale of their take-or-pay deals supports America’s push for domestic semiconductor leadership, buying goodwill and tempering how aggressively regulators wield the antitrust hammer. For these companies, predictability in the legal arena translates into billions of dollars in strategic value. Moreover, the U.S. government in our scenario would pressure EU regulators to back off as well, in exchange for a more stable supply chain for advanced silicon. Since the U.S. is funding the future of silicon, it has the moral authority to pressure EU regulators to moderate their anti-Big Tech stance against U.S. companies. By opting for wafer guarantees rather than equity stakes, the hyperscalers sidestep the classic venture capital pitfall of waiting a decade for payback. Every one of these companies is in constant need of leading-edge silicon; paying upfront for guaranteed capacity isn’t just a hedge, it’s an essential input to their day-to-day business. So unlike a typical long-horizon investment, these wafer commitments deliver near-term strategic value: a stable supply of advanced chips to fuel growth in AI, cloud services, consumer devices and more. In return, the new foundry scores sustained demand. Even if early yields lag behind TSMC’s global best, the arrangement smooths out the revenue cycle while the JV works to improve yield and process maturity. It’s a symbiotic setup: Big Tech gets supply and the foundry gets a stable customer base and a realistic shot at scale. Apple Apple has long been TSMC’s shining star, but a single point of manufacturing failure is no longer tenable. Diversifying to a domestic foundry paves the way for second-source security across iPhone, iPad and Mac chips. Over the long haul, Apple might also co-develop next-gen packaging lines at the JV, ensuring it retains a competitive edge in device performance. AWS AWS is hungry for capacity for its Graviton CPUs, Trainium and Inferentia AI chips, plus whatever HPC solutions loom on the horizon. And there’s a regulatory carrot: If Amazon helps secure U.S. semiconductor leadership, the government will commit to soften scrutiny around its e-commerce dominance. Google Google Cloud’s TPU programs demand advanced silicon to power AI/ML workloads at large scale. A domestic foundry removes the uncertainty of Taiwanese supply lines and the U.S. government would agree to lessen its scrutiny around data privacy or large-scale acquisitions. Predictability here is priceless for a company whose approach is “move fast and innovate.” Microsoft Microsoft’s diverse product suite spans cloud hardware, AI chips (Project Athena) and even Xbox SoCs. A stake in U.S.-based capacity can deflect the usual antitrust chatter around Office and Windows bundling. The real boon is ensuring timely access to advanced nodes for its AI and console businesses. Meta Meta faces heavy scrutiny on social media policy and data privacy. Securing advanced-node chips for AI inference, training, and upcoming AR/VR headsets is mission-critical. Making big wafer commitments demonstrates goodwill that could soften regulators’ stances on everything from user data to content moderation. Nvidia As the go-to provider of GPUs for AI and gaming, Nvidia constantly grapples with supply shortages — and no one knows that better than data center customers. Having a domestic fab option helps shield against overseas risk and further ingratiates Nvidia to U.S. policymakers, potentially smoothing the road for future expansions or acquisitions. Additional stakeholders in this model could include the U.S. military, Qualcomm Inc., Tesla Inc., MediaTek, AMD and possibly IBM, which could also contribute IP from its advanced research in chips. A U.S.-based advanced foundry JV, underpinned by these massive “take-or-pay” agreements, is more than a financial arrangement. It’s an ecosystem-level deal that ties the fortunes of Big Tech to America’s semiconductor resurgence. Each hyperscaler hedges against global uncertainty and gains a modicum of regulatory relief in the process. Meanwhile, the JV secures guaranteed demand from day one — enough to build momentum toward competitive yields, node maturity and long-term viability. In short, this is a bet on stability — geopolitical, operational and regulatory — and at a time when advanced silicon has become the oil of the digital economy. We believe that’s an investment well worth making. Total Upfront Payments: $25 billion Total Milestone Payments: $19 billion Grand Total: $44 billion (over five years) Note: These figures are illustrative to show a hypothetical scale. They should be adjusted based on overall fab construction costs, negotiated TSMC licensing fees, and a reasonable node volume. This structure gives the new American Foundry approximately $100 billion in capital over a five-year period. With TSMC’s leadership, process expertise and talent injection it dramatically increases the chances of having a viable advanced semiconductor manufacturing source on U.S. shores with a U.S.-domiciled company. Once the foundry is spun out, Intel can refocus on its core: designing innovative CPUs, GPUs, AI accelerators and custom silicon solutions. By removing the financial and managerial overhead of manufacturing, Intel’s leadership can redeploy cash toward R&D in architecture, software stacks, packaging innovation and go-to-market partnerships. A streamlined Intel might look a lot like AMD, Nvidia or Qualcomm — fabless (or fab-lite) — yet able to bring advanced chip designs to market quickly by tapping TSMC’s best processes. Intel could still have preferential access to the newly created JV, securing capacity for its own x86 lines at better rates or guaranteed volumes. But if that JV lags TSMC’s mainline by too much, Intel’s design arm could also choose to go direct to TSMC’s Taiwan fabs or Samsung’s foundries. This freedom would be an enormous boost to Intel’s competitiveness. No longer chained to a sub-scale manufacturing model, Intel design engineers can choose whichever advanced node best suits the product timeline and competitive environment. An independent Intel design division also satisfies the concerns of regulators who fear large-scale consolidation. Selling the design arm to Broadcom would add to the wave of semiconductor M&A that the government is already carefully scrutinizing. By staying independent, Intel remains a distinct competitor in CPU, HPC and AI markets. The U.S. Department of Defense also gains because Intel can keep focusing on specialized designs for defense-related applications, while the new JV foundry (with TSMC stewardship) handles secure manufacturing on American soil. It’s a synergy that retains critical R&D in the United States, fosters multiple points of competition, and ensures a stable supply chain for military and civilian infrastructure. TSMC has already broken ground on fabs in Arizona, though it has struggled with costs and workforce challenges. Critics question whether TSMC will allocate its best technology to U.S. sites. In the proposed JV scenario, TSMC could opt to transfer a slightly older node to ensure it retains absolute leadership in Taiwan. The new entity might operate at “N-1” levels of technology. Yet for many hyperscaler workloads — such as server CPUs, AI inference chips or specialized accelerators — being a generation behind might be acceptable when weighed against the security of local supply. Over a decade, with guaranteed volume and financial stability, that JV could close some of the gap if TSMC invests in incremental process improvements. One could argue that the U.S. government wants Intel to succeed as a standalone integrated manufacturer. But the repeated delays and huge losses reveal that Intel won’t ever catch up to TSMC alone (without unlimited capital and time). The CHIPS Act aims to ensure advanced node capacity exists in the U.S., not necessarily that Intel remains integrated if that model is doomed to fail. A TSMC-led JV, operating on U.S. soil, employing tens of thousands of Americans, and financed partly by Big Tech’s wafer prepayments, meets the spirit of the CHIPS Act. For the government, it’s a pragmatic solution to ensure advanced manufacturing doesn’t vanish entirely from American shores. A valid concern is that Intel might lose its “co-optimization” advantage by spinning out manufacturing. But the success of AMD, Nvidia and Apple’s silicon team indicates that close partnerships with TSMC can achieve better results than a sub-scale in-house approach. Intel’s advanced packaging technologies (such as EMIB and Foveros) can be licensed to or co-developed with TSMC under commercial agreements. As an independent design entity, Intel can become more nimble, not less. Take-or-pay contracts assume that advanced node yields will improve over time. Early yields might be poor. The hyperscalers, however, get two things they value: guaranteed capacity (even if it’s behind TSMC’s leading edge) and better regulatory standing with the government. Over the long haul, if yields are too low and the JV fails, the hyperscalers would still have TSMC’s mainline in Taiwan (or Samsung) as a fallback. Because these are multiyear deals, the JV has enough runway to fix process issues, guided by TSMC’s real-world experience. Rather than ceding its legacy to Broadcom or any other suitor, Intel should embrace a strategic pivot that upholds competition, national security and the spirit of American innovation. The steps are clear, albeit not easy: Intel’s board is under pressure to deliver shareholder value in the wake of ongoing foundry failures. Selling Intel’s design business to Broadcom might look like a quick fix, but it would sacrifice a venerable American brand at the lowest point of its valuation — an outcome that undermines competition, national security and the legacy of one of tech’s greatest innovators. We believe it is incumbent on this board, which oversaw the flawed IDM 2.0 strategy, to preserve Intel as an independent entity and support the hard work it will take to give rebirth to this American icon. The visionary and entirely viable route is to spin out the foundry, swallow the painful discount, and let Intel’s design house flourish independently. We’ve seen the positive results of such a strategy with AMD, which soared after distancing itself from foundry headaches. With a TSMC-led joint venture offering a U.S.-based alternative to Taiwan’s facilities — and hyperscalers incentivized to prepay for wafer volume — this scenario provides a lifeline for advanced semiconductor manufacturing in America. It keeps Intel relevant in the CPU, GPU and AI arenas. It aligns with government aims for robust competition and supply chain security. And it ensures that “Intel Inside” remains more than just a memory. In short, Intel’s next chapter need not be defined by a desperate sale to a conglomerate. The foundry spinout is a bitter pill, but once swallowed, it could liberate Intel’s design prowess for decades to come — reestablishing it as a powerhouse of American innovation, sustaining competition across the CPU and AI markets, and serving as a keystone in the broader effort to restore domestic semiconductor manufacturing leadership. It’s a vision that demands courage from Intel’s board, patience from its shareholders, and cooperation from the U.S. government and partners like TSMC and the hyperscalers — but one that could ultimately salvage Intel’s future as an iconic force in technology.

Title: Tech Insider: A big move ahead of Spark’s earnings, more Callaghan ‘chaos’, Southlander’s start-up raises A$5m – and who is NZ’s DOGE-master?

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. An investment fund backs up the truck ahead of Spark’s half-year earnings on Friday. An insider details Callaghan ‘chaos’ as the agency enters its defunding death spiral. An Invercargill-born entrepreneur scores A$5 million for his start-up. It’s 3am Eternal for owners of US shares who’ve gained access to extended trading. And an authoritative poll reveals who could lead a DOGE-like initiative in NZ - or not. Ahead of its half-year earnings this Friday, some analysts and fund managers still rate Spark a “sell”. Others say it’s been beaten down so far its shares are a “buy”. ACC has just revealed it is in Camp Buy. Our state accident insurer’s investment wing – which has leaned tech-sceptic over the past couple of years, compared to our other Crown giant, the NZ Super Fund – disclosed on February 13 that it had topped up its stake in Spark to just above the 5% major holding threshold between October 12 and February 12 by purchasing $52.2 million worth of Spark shares on the NZX and A$27.5m ($30m) worth on the ASX. Craigs is Camp Sell – or at least it put Spark in its bad books as its earnings preview clumped NZX firms into positive, neutral and negative piles. After an unusual miss for its full-year earnings, delivered last August, Spark surprised again – and again in a bad way – by lowering its FY2025 guidance in October. Craigs says there is “some chance of a further downgrade” but that this possibility is already built into the telco’s price. “A key focus will be on FCF [free cashflow] cover for dividends and the extent to which the current weakness is macro-driven or due to increased competition.” In other words, how much of a poor result could be pinned on the crummy economy and Government IT departments shelving their chequebooks, and how much can down to post-merger 2degrees being on a roll? Morningstar’s Brian Han says investors have over-sold, and Spark represents good buying as long as it sees through cost-cutting. Forsyth Barr analysts Aaron Ibbotson and Benjamin Crozier, who downgraded Spark to “underperform” on February 14, with a $2.80 12-month target (shares closed Friday at $2.90), said there is “potential for a restructuring charge to be pulled out of its ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation] guidance”. The pair also want an update on the capital-raising push announced at Spark’s full-year result in August, when chair Justine Smyth said the telco would explore various options to raise $1b for data-centre expansion over the next five years. They want to see a construction timeline, too. A Callaghan Innovation insider alleges potential issues with commercial contracts and an ongoing hazchem disposal issues Some 350 Callaghan Innovation staff already know their agency is going to lose its funding on June 30 – with some jobs going to other agencies, if on a lag of up to six months, with enabling legislation for science sector changes not due before Parliament before the fourth quarter and not coming into effect until next year. Callaghan offers research services for early-stage firms and developers of new technologies, and administers growth grants and the Government’s tax rebate for R&D. Earlier this month, the Public Service Association said Callaghan staff did not know who would get a role with another agency under a sweeping science sector restructure or when – leading some to look offshore for work in what the union says is a “brain-drain of the Government’s own making”. Late last week, a Callaghan staffer – whose name has been withheld – wrote to the Herald about what they saw as “the chaos and widespread damage caused by the Government’s decision to disestablish this vital department. Most of us were told of the closure only on the morning the press release went out, leaving staff completely stunned and unprepared”. “I would like to particularly highlight the significant losses and the catastrophic consequences of the lack of planning surrounding this enormous decision. The situation at Callaghan is an utter shambles and it’s clear that nothing has been properly thought out. From the perspective of both staff and many established customers, it feels as though the Government is attempting to fly a plane while it is still being built,” the staffer wrote. “For example, no one at Callaghan knows when their final paycheque will come. Only the 80 staff members who were given four weeks’ notice on February 12 – mostly from the research & development team, business innovation advisors and some internal functions like marketing – have any certainty. For everyone else, there is no clarity on when we will be let go, except that it will happen in ‘waves’. “This lack of detailed information has serious consequences for employees’ ability to plan for the future and, more importantly, their mental health.” They continued: “The Gracefield [research] site has received no direction on what will happen next. Staff are being forced to figure out not only how to manage the loss of staff but also how to dispose of chemicals and other scientific materials safely. The risk of legal and compliance issues resulting from this poor planning is substantial and the administrative cost of unwinding this hasty and poorly managed shutdown will only increase over time.” Last year, a leaked memo said hazardous goods storage is not up to scratch in some of Callaghan’s laboratories, with $120m in remediatory work required over the next five years. In a letter of expectations leaked to the Herald earlier this month, new Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Shane Reti instructed Callaghan to “explore commercial opportunities to retain the Gracefield site as a centre for science and innovation” – presumably for the yet-to-be-detailed public research organisation envisioned by the Government. The staffer continued: “Callaghan scientists also undertake critical scientific research under contract for numerous businesses. “These contracts often extend well beyond the June disestablishment date, leaving customers in limbo, unsure of who, if anyone, will be able to carry on their commercial work. “Many of these businesses are now facing serious challenges, with expensive and time-sensitive R&D work halted with no plan for how to proceed. The scientists working on these projects are highly specialised and their expertise cannot be easily replaced.” Tech Insider put the staffer’s comments to Callaghan chief executive Stefan Korn. “I know this is a difficult and distressing time for our people. We’re working at pace to give staff and customers certainty about how the disestablishment of the organisation will affect them,” Korn replied. “However, winding up an organisation as complicated as Callaghan Innovation is not straightforward. We have multiple challenges to work through, including the transfer of some functions to other entities, the shutdown of other parts of the organisation and the safe and effective management of the Gracefield Innovation Quarter [GIQ]. “For example, planning work is now under way to safely deal with the disposal of a large range of chemicals and hazardous substances that have been used by the scientists at GIQ over the years.” Korn added: “As much as we would’ve liked to give people answers on day one, it’s important to work through the detail and get things right. “We’re doing everything we can to support our people and customers in this transition.” “The science sector reforms aim to ensure we focus our investment that will generate greatest value for our economy and our people,” Reti said. “Callaghan Innovation was spread too thin across many conflicting functions – it’s struggled to work to a clear focused purpose. “To better support and incentivise innovation for economic growth, we have decided to disestablish Callaghan Innovation and establish a new Public Research Organisation [PRO] to focus on delivering research in AI [artificial intelligence], synthetic biology, aerospace, medical and quantum technologies. “Some of Callaghan’s functions will be transferred to MBIE [the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment] or the new PRO. “Some functions will not be transferred, so an in-principle decision has been made for the funding to be reallocated. “I understand that in this round of change, the board of Callaghan Innovation has considered roles that aren’t currently working on customer contracts. “I acknowledge that these changes will be challenging for staff involved. I am confident that the science reforms ... will strengthen our science system and create more opportunities for economic growth over time.” Earlier this month, Callaghan senior research scientist Ben Wylie-van Eerd told the Herald that while the Government had outlined plans for a new advanced technology research organisation, the lack of a firm timeline – other than a legislative timetable indicating it was at least six months away, and probably more – meant a lot of his colleagues were already job-hunting for offshore roles. Trump’s talking up more tariffs. Ukraine is offering the US priority access to lithium as it bargains for its life. Think Tesla’s going to have a good day? Now you place a punt before the Nasdaq’s opening bell. Trading platform CMC recently launched extended-hours trading on the “Magnificent Seven” stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla). The move proved so popular that CMC has now increased the breadth of extended hours trading to 80 popular US stocks, CMC’s Markets New Zealand general manager Chris Smith says. Kiwis can start pre-market trading from 10pm NZT, well before the US stock exchanges open at 3.30am NZT. “We’ve seen recently that international news can have a major impact on markets and we want to give our investors the best opportunity to react as fast as they can,” Smith told Tech Insider. Invercargill-raised Derek Troy-West has raised A$5m at a $A25m valuation for the software start-up he founded with his wife. Troy-West did a computer science degree at Auckland University then worked as a software developer for Spark before heading to the UK for a few years, where he met his wife Kylie Forge (now Kylie Troy-West), an Australian also on her OE after graduating from La Trobe. The pair settled back in Melbourne in 2012 and founded Factor House in 2019. The start-up builds developer tools that allow engineers to manage the processing of massive amounts of real-time data. Its first product, Kpow, is an engineering toolkit designed to enhance and simplify the management of Kafka – an open-source distributed-event-streaming platform developed by LinkedIn that allows data to be transported efficiently and accurately between different systems and applications. Customers include Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Block, Pepperstone and Afterpay. The A$5m seed raise was led by Australasia’s largest venture capital (VC) firm, Blackbird. Factor House said the round was supported by others including Auckland-based angel investor Steven Holmes – who made his investment in a personal capacity but is perhaps best-known in the VC community as the director of rich-lister Murray Bolton’s family office, Bolton Equities. Sorry, I had to ask. Half of my self-selecting sample of my followers on LinkedIn hated the idea of Prime Minister Christopher Luxon replicating Elon Musk’s DOGE rampage in the US with a local tech figure in charge. I would have added recent policy enthusiast Rod Drury, too, but LinkedIn only allows four choices (and doesn’t support embedding, so I had to recreate it above but see the original here). You could say former Telecom and Spark executive Simon Moutter is now in the frame, too, given he was recently made chair of Kāinga Ora (with former Spark “chief turnaround officer” Matt Crockett appointed Kāinga Ora’s chief executive around the same time). Comments ranged from “the constitutional equivalent of arson” to “I don’t think anyone in NZ has the stomach for it” to various proposals to streamline a spending purger with AI. Steven Joyce and Richie McCaw got write-ins. Feel free to leave your take in Comments below (once Comments are open). Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team.

Warren Buffett continues to unload billions of dollars of Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Bank of America (BAC). New SEC filings show Buffett sold 117.4 million shares of BAC worth about $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, reducing its stake in the financial giant to 8.9%. Meanwhile, Berkshire added a new investment in the alcoholic beverages producer Constellation Brands (STZ), which brews both Corona and Modelo Especial. The firm accumulated about $1.2 billion of Constellation stock at year end after buying 5.6 million shares. In Q4, Berkshire also bought about 12 million shares of satellite radio provider Sirius XM (SIRI), worth about $325 million, and bought 1.1 million more shares of Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), worth about $470 million.

These five Berkshire Hathaway holdings represent compelling investment opportunities for long-term ... [+] investors in 2025. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio has long served as a beacon for value investors seeking quality companies with durable competitive advantages. As we move through 2025, several of Berkshire's holdings stand out as attractive investments, combining strong fundamentals with reasonable valuations despite the broader market's continued focus on technology and growth stocks. This analysis examines five of the most promising Berkshire Hathaway positions that offer investors strong business models, competitive moats and potential for long-term capital appreciation. Each selection represents a company that aligns with Buffett's investment philosophy and appears well-positioned for success in today's evolving economic landscape. Buffett’s investment strategy centers on identifying companies with strong competitive advantages, capable management teams and the ability to generate consistent free cash flow. His philosophy emphasizes purchasing great businesses at reasonable prices rather than mediocre businesses at bargain prices. This approach has proven successful through multiple market cycles, with Berkshire Hathaway delivering compound annual returns well above market averages over several decades. The “Oracle of Omaha” focuses on businesses he understands, avoiding complex technologies or models lacking transparent earnings potential. He prioritizes companies with pricing power, strong brand recognition and the ability to maintain or expand market share even during economic downturns. This conservative yet effective approach has made Buffett one of history's most successful investors. This selection process focused on Berkshire Hathaway’s current portfolio holdings, analyzing each position based on fundamental strength, market position and alignment with Buffett's investment principles. I prioritized companies with strong cash flows, reasonable valuations and durable competitive advantages. Special attention was paid to recent business performance, management effectiveness and potential catalysts for future growth. Each selected company was evaluated against current market conditions and sector-specific challenges. I considered factors such as return on equity, debt levels and free cash flow generation. Additionally, I examined each company's ability to maintain or grow market share in their respective industries while delivering consistent returns to shareholders. Bank of America is one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, serving approximately 66 million consumers and small business clients with about 4,000 retail financial centers. The bank has successfully transformed its digital capabilities, with over 90% of all consumer transactions now conducted through digital channels. Their conservative lending practices and strong balance sheet position them well in the current economic environment. Bank of America represents Berkshire's largest financial sector holding, with a stake now valued north of $35 billion and accounting for more than 8% of Berkshire's portfolio, and for good reason. The bank's diversified revenue streams, with consumer banking contributing around 35% of revenue, wealth management above 20%, and investment banking approximately 25%, coupled with a tier 1 capital ratio exceeding 11%, position it well amid varying economic conditions. Their strong capital position, with stress test results showing capacity to maintain dividends even under severe economic scenarios, and focus on operational efficiency – demonstrated by a cost-to-income ratio below 60% and declining – make it well-positioned to benefit from the current interest rate environment above 5%. Net interest income margins have expanded north of 2.5%, contributing to return on equity around 15%. Recent investments exceeding $3.5 billion annually in digital technology have improved customer satisfaction scores above 80% while reducing operating costs by approximately 20% per transaction, leading to enhanced profitability metrics. Digital engagement now exceeds 75% of total consumer interactions, with mobile users growing at around 10% annually. The bank's efficiency ratio has improved to below 60%, while maintaining a loan-to-deposit ratio around 70%, providing ample liquidity for future growth. Their wealth management division alone generates over $5 billion in annual revenue, with client balances north of $3 trillion, providing stable fee-based income regardless of interest rate fluctuations. Coca-Cola remains the world's largest non-alcoholic beverage company, with a portfolio of more than 200 brands sold in over 200 countries. The company's recent strategic initiatives have focused on expanding its presence in growing categories such as ready-to-drink coffee, sports drinks, and premium waters. Their adaptive business model has successfully responded to changing consumer preferences while maintaining strong brand equity. As one of Buffett's longest-held positions, acquired for less than $1.3 billion and now worth north of $25 billion, Coca-Cola exemplifies his preference for businesses with strong brands and pricing power, demonstrated by operating margins above 30% despite inflationary pressures and ability to maintain price increases around 8% annually without significant volume impact. The company's extensive distribution network, reaching over 200 markets globally and servicing north of 25 million retail customer outlets, coupled with marketing capabilities exceeding $4 billion annually, create significant barriers to entry. Their market share exceeds 45% in global carbonated beverages, while maintaining a presence in over 80% of all food service locations worldwide. The company's strategic expansion into healthier beverages, with non-carbonated brands growing at around 15% annually and now representing more than 30% of portfolio revenue, effectively addresses changing consumer trends. Premium water brands alone contribute north of $7 billion in annual revenue, growing at double-digit rates. The company has increased its dividend for 61 consecutive years, demonstrating remarkable consistency in shareholder returns, with a payout ratio around 75% and free cash flow conversion exceeding 95% of net income. Their return on invested capital remains above 20%, while maintaining a global brand value estimated north of $90 billion, making it one of the most valuable brands worldwide. Apple has evolved from a computer manufacturer into a global technology ecosystem encompassing hardware, software and services. The company's iPhone remains its flagship product, but its services segment, including Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store, has grown to represent over 20% of revenue. Recent ventures into augmented reality and artificial intelligence demonstrate its continued innovation leadership. Despite being a technology company, Apple fits Buffett's investment criteria through its industry-leading brand loyalty, with retention rates north of 90% in its core iPhone business, unmatched pricing power evidenced by average selling prices around 50% higher than competitors, and massive cash generation exceeding $100 billion annually. The company's ecosystem creates high switching costs through over 2 billion active devices globally, while its services business, growing at around 15% annually and maintaining margins above 70%, provides recurring revenue streams now accounting for north of 25% of total revenue. Apple's share repurchase program, having returned over $600 billion to shareholders since inception and reducing share count by approximately 25%, combines with a dividend that's grown at a double-digit rate for over a decade. The company's fortress balance sheet, with north of $150 billion in cash and investments, and market leadership position – commanding around 50% of the premium smartphone market in North America and maintaining App Store gross margins above 80% – make it a compelling long-term investment. The company's emerging revenue streams, including wearables growing at over 20% annually and representing a market size larger than 75% of Fortune 500 companies, coupled with its nascent AI initiatives and rumored electric vehicle ambitions, provide multiple vectors for future growth while maintaining operating margins above 30%. Occidental Petroleum is a leading oil and gas producer with premier assets in the Permian Basin. The company’s integrated business model includes chemical manufacturing and carbon management solutions. Recent investments in carbon capture technology and low-carbon initiatives position OXY as a leader in sustainable energy production. Buffett's significant stake in Occidental, now representing north of 25% ownership of the company, reflects his confidence in the company's management and long-term energy market position in the Permian Basin, where OXY maintains around 40% lower production costs compared to industry averages. The company's robust free cash flow generation, exceeding $3 billion quarterly at current oil prices, coupled with a strengthened balance sheet that has reduced net debt by more than 50% since 2020, supports continued dividend growth and an aggressive share repurchase program targeting around 15% of market cap annually. Operating margins hover above 30%, significantly outpacing industry peers, while the return on capital employed remains north of 20%. OXY's leadership in carbon capture technology, with over $5 billion committed to direct air capture facilities and enhanced oil recovery methods yielding around 25% higher recovery rates than conventional methods, provides substantial competitive advantages in an increasingly environmentally conscious industry. The company's carbon management business is projected to contribute north of $1 billion in annual revenue by 2027, while its enhanced oil recovery techniques reduce carbon intensity by approximately 20% compared to traditional extraction methods. OXY maintains significant financial flexibility even in challenging price environments with a breakeven price below $40 per barrel and operating costs in the lowest quartile of global producers. Moody's is a leading global integrated risk assessment firm, providing credit ratings, research, tools and analysis that contribute to transparent financial markets. The company's analytics division has expanded significantly, offering software solutions for risk management, financial analysis, and regulatory compliance. Recent acquisitions have strengthened its position in ESG and climate risk assessment. Moody's exemplifies Buffett's preference for companies with wide economic moats and predictable earnings, demonstrated by its industry-leading operating margins of just under 50% and return on equity in the 70-80% range. The company's oligopolistic market position in credit ratings, with a 32% global market share, coupled with high entry barriers and strong recurring revenue from its analytics business – which now accounts for over 30% of total revenue and grew by over 15% year-over-year – creates a powerful competitive advantage. The analytics division's recurring revenue model has pushed contract renewal rates to north of 90%, while the average contract value has increased by double digits annually over the past three years. Growing demand for risk assessment tools and ESG analytics, evidenced by 35% + growth in ESG-related revenues and a pipeline of (over $2.5 billion) in potential analytics contracts, provides additional growth opportunities while maintaining high margins. The company's asset-light business model generates exceptional free cash flow conversion of over 75% of net income, supporting reinvestment in growth initiatives and shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks. These five Berkshire Hathaway holdings represent compelling investment opportunities for long-term investors in 2025. Each company possesses the characteristics Buffett values: strong competitive positions, capable management teams and the ability to generate consistent cash flows. From Bank of America's financial strength to Apple's ecosystem dominance, and from Coca-Cola's brand power to Occidental's energy leadership and Moody's market dominance, these selections offer a diversified approach to value investing aligned with Buffett's time-tested principles. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, these companies appear well-positioned to deliver sustainable returns in the years ahead.

Title: 5 unique ways I use Android 15’s Private Space that aren’t for porn or cheating

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onFebruary 16, 2025 When Android 15 landed with Private Space in tow, everyone — me included — winked at their screen and nodded, knowing exactly what that new feature would be used for. I won’t delve into your or my private business; that’s not exactly my jam. But when I activated Private Space on my Pixel 9 Pro (it’s a Pixel exclusive for now), I realized that it’s a very powerful and unique addition to my Android phone that enables me to do things I couldn’t before. With time, I’ve come across five different use cases for Private Space that make it essential for me because of security, privacy, distraction management, or convenience. If you’re not familiar with the feature, check out how to activate and use Private Space, and then follow me as I explain how I personally use it. If my Android phone falls into the hands of a thief, especially if they manage to snatch it from me when it’s unlocked or if they somehow steal my PIN code, I don’t want them to have access to my most sensitive apps. Hiding financial apps under Private Space, and making sure Private Space itself is hidden too, adds one more layer of security. This ensures that thieves or nosy people either don’t see these apps at all or aren’t able to access them because they’re locked behind a different PIN code. (Google has a disclaimer about malicious apps or adb being able to detect private apps, but I still think it’s worth it for being one more layer to deter petty thieves.) I do leave one banking app in the main app drawer, though — usually the one with the smallest account and no credit card access. That’s usually my day-to-day account. The other apps often live in my Private Space, though I’ve had to make peace with the fact that I never receive any notifications from them because of the feature’s limitation. That’s usually fine, except for French banking apps, which always require me to validate any online payment by going through the app and agreeing. Since I don’t get any notifications, I have to manually unlock Private Space, open the app, and then agree to the payment pop-up, but that’s a small price to pay for extra security. I’ve also tried putting the apps for my smart lock and security system in Private Space to stop anyone from opening my front door or disarming my alarm, but the problem is that I do definitely rely on getting notifications from these apps. A workaround would be to create two users with different permissions — one visible in my app drawer with limited powers and one hidden in Private Space with admin privileges — but I haven’t been able to dial in those permissions exactly to my liking. So for now, these apps remain in my main app list. I also attempted to hide 1Password, my password manager, to keep any passwords away from prying eyes, but I noticed that I heavily rely on it as an autofill solution and I can’t use that if it’s locked in private. Manually checking login details every time was very inconvenient. I know that using two different password managers would circumvent that, but it’s a very overkill solution for me, for now. Notifications aren’t the only thing that Private Space stops. The feature essentially sandboxes and quarantines apps in a separate environment with no access to my contacts, calendar, files, photos, or anything else on my phone. And that’s absolutely perfect when I want to use an app that I don’t completely trust. Sometimes it’s an app from a developer I don’t know, sometimes it’s a random app I’m briefly testing and want to delete later, and sometimes, it’s just Twitter X. No matter the reason, if there’s an app I’m not so sure about or want to keep away from the rest of my phone, then Private Space is where I’ll install it. That way I know that I’m giving it less room to roam and less data to siphon by default. Plus, when Private Space is locked, potentially problematic apps can’t perform any background actions, use any of my phone’s sensors, or track me across other apps. Private Space keeps them off and offline, and I love that. I have four Google accounts, three of which I use daily (personal, work, and shared with my husband). The fourth one is an old shared account that my husband and I created on a trip to Austria when we were still living in Lebanon. It was meant to help us get access to Google features and apps that were available in the EU but not on a Lebanese account. Since then, we’ve moved to France and created a shared French account, so this fourth account is not longer essential. But it still has a thing or two that we care about and that we weren’t able to migrate or were too lazy to migrate. Since I rarely use this account, I don’t want it installed on my phone, littering every account picker and account switcher menu. I just want access to some things a few times a year. Previously, I accessed it from the browser sometimes or added it to my phone then remove it, but not anymore. Now, that’s the account I associate with my Private Space account and I can just let it be, untouched, for weeks on end, then when I need to check it, I just unlock Private Space and open Gmail, Chrome, Keep, or Maps to check it out. If I could quarantine all of my apps, I would, but for now, Instagram and Threads would have to do. Keeping them locked away means I’m not tempted to open them when I see that icon in my app drawer. With no notifications and no background updates, they have no way to disturb me, either. I’ve tried putting a time restriction on apps with Digital Wellbeing, but that didn’t do much, and I always ended up unpausing the app once the timer hit. With Private Space, I find that I’m less inclined to open the app because it’s hidden away from my eyes. Out of sight, out of mind, as the proverb says. There are a million and one reasons for why you’d need to have two instances of the same app, and the sad part is that stock Android doesn’t allow this when other skins offer it. With Private Space, though, we have a workaround that lets us create a second and independent instance of an app on a Pixel phone. I find this is very useful in apps that don’t allow me to have multiple accounts logged in at the same time. Amazon, for example, requires a multi-step process to let me switch from my French account to my US, German, Spanish, or Italian ones. And since some items are sometimes heavily discounted in other countries but not in France, I just want quick access to those countries’ stores without messing with my main account. That’s why I use a secondary instance of Amazon to check prices and order items from other countries. I also have two Spotify accounts in different locales that are useful when I come across geo-restricted music. Instead of logging out and in again, I can just check my second account, see if it’s available there, then decide if it’s worth going through any extra hoops to listen to that music or not. It’s a very restricted use case, but it’s come in handy once or twice. There are also other apps where I have both a personal account and a joint one with my husband. Booking.com, GetYourGuide, ChatGPT, and Uber are some of the ones that come to mind, and being able to have both accounts logged in on the same phone is a time-saver. This is where my journey with Private Space ends for now. I know that for many, it’s a convenient way to hide their dirtiest secrets, but I really appreciate the feature for its immense potential. I just hope to see it come to stock Android and stop being a Pixel-exclusive feature.

Title: Earnings, Fed Watching, And Warren Buffett’s Annual Letter Ahead

Consumer inflation (CPI) was higher than expected in January. One of the culprits was airfare, with ... [+] used car prices and auto insurance premiums adding to the rise. (Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images) Earnings season is nearing the finish line, with over three-quarters of the fourth-quarter earnings season complete. The pace of earnings releases eases to 45 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. 76% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Only one of the Magnificent 7, Nvidia (NVDA), is left to release earnings on February 26. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season The S&P 500 rose 1.5% for the week, with the Magnificent 7 outperforming with a 2.1% gain. Markets were pleasantly surprised with President Donald Trump’s announcement that ordered a study of reciprocal tariffs rather than an immediate implementation. Market Returns According to FactSet data, multiple sectors drove the improvement in the earnings growth rate for the week. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by communications services and consumer discretionary. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-eight percent decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Expected sales growth was unchanged for the week at 5.2% but exceeding expectations at the start of earnings season, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. 4Q 2024 Sales Estimates By Sector Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for financials, communication services, and consumer discretionary, the blended earnings performance has significantly outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +16.9% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Consumer Price Index inflation came in hot for January, rising to a 3% year-over-year rate. Used cars, airfares, and auto insurance premiums were a large part of the story behind the numbers. Inflation has recently accelerated, with the three-month annualized rate at 4.9%. Help from some of the volatile components and housing inflation should help it ease somewhat from here. U.S. Consumer Inflation: CPI Despite an ugly month-over-month gain for services inflation, excluding housing, the year-over-year rate declined to 4%. If services inflation continues to improve, markets and the Federal Reserve will rest easier about inflation fears. Services Inflation While December retail sales were revised higher, January data exhibited evidence of a broad-based spending hangover from the robust spending data at the end of last year. In addition, natural disasters may have weighed on spending. As long as U.S. employment continues to rise, consumer spending should snap back. Consumer Spending & Jobs Sluggish consumer spending caused the Atlanta Federal Reserve to cut its estimate of first-quarter GDP growth to 2.3%. This is nowhere near recessionary levels, but it is down from the robust growth estimate of 2.9% before the retail sales release. On a more positive note, the easing in economic growth estimates helped bring 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields down from higher levels following the hotter-than-expected consumer inflation reading. 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Without as much meaningful economic data this week and most of it impacted by natural disasters, the Federal Reserve meeting minutes on Wednesday could provide some clues to the timing of the next rate cut. The Fed is expected to be on the sidelines until at least mid-year when it might resume short-term interest rate cuts. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts Earnings season continues during the holiday-shortened week, but the pace of releases has begun to slow. Given Trump’s feverish pace of policy announcements, markets will continue to be on guard, although market participants seem to be adapting to the new administration as is typical. The highlight of the week should be Berkshire Hathaway’s earnings and Warren Buffett’s highly anticipated annual letter on Saturday. This follows the release of the details of Berkshire Hathaway’s publicly traded stock portfolio last Friday. Buffett seems to have continued to reduce Berkshire’s allocation to stocks, but he added one new company to its stable of holdings. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds many stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.

Meta's recent job cuts were part of the social media giant's plans to trim down 5% of its workforce by focusing on the lowest performers. But some terminated employees told BI they were shocked they were being let go given their track record. Internal guidance from Meta's director of people experience — viewed by BI — said managers were allowed to cut higher-performing employees if they couldn't meet their reduction targets. That left some workers who were impacted feeling misrepresented by Meta's stance on layoffs. Now they're worried about how it will impact job prospects.

Title: How to avoid being labeled an 'underperformer,' according to the ex-VP of HR at Microsoft
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-avoid-underperformer-label-and-layoffs-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-16T10:15:48Z
Full Content:
Several companies are laying off people they call "underperformers." Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Intuit have all recently done this. The lesson from these layoffs is that simply doing your job well isn't enough. You can toil away for decades doing a fine job and still get caught up in these layoffs. To avoid what seems like a random label, it helps to understand how it happens. On its face, it seems obvious: If a company wants to reduce costs, it makes sense to discard the poorest-performing people. The issue is the haphazard way these evaluations are often done. Dozens of long-term employees from Meta, Microsoft, and others have taken to social media to share their shock. They tell of 10, 20, or even 30-year careers with unbroken strings of excellent reviews, only to get one surprise terrible review followed promptly by a layoff. No one would challenge that poor performers — people who can't meet basic metrics and who repeatedly fall short despite warnings — are candidates for dismissal. That's exactly why companies use this label. Widespread news of a layoff brands the company as in distress. Companies know that potential candidates for their thousands of open positions would avoid joining a company that just did a layoff. On the other hand, branding a layoff as culling the poor performers looks great. The company is removing dead wood, holding higher standards, and striving to be the best. Rather than looking in distress, it looks aggressive and healthy. High-performance people will seek out companies like this. In addition, terminating people for performance helps avoid a range of potential legal issues. Many notification rules don't apply when performance is the justification. A company can avoid or minimize severance obligations when firing for performance, and many of the discrimination laws could be sidestepped as well. If the performance-based layoff hits older or other protected-class workers disproportionately, the excuse could be, "But their performance." These companies already have built-in mechanisms to identify and remove chronic poor performers. Several of them have quota systems that require a certain percentage of their employees to be labeled in the bottom performance tier. Those employees are routinely removed in what is called "unregretted attrition." But then come these layoffs. Managers at all levels are told to identify poor performers and lay them off. They've already done that for years. Now they may have to find more, and that's often done in a cynical and random fashion. "They've been here forever, how about them?" "Nobody likes them, they can go." or "What have they done for me lately?" That's the haphazard way even good people could get branded as underperforming. Managers don't simply stack rank their team and pull the bottom people — that well is dry. What they do is get together with their peers to try to find the layoff candidates among their ranks. They'll discuss individuals and their accomplishments. The worst possible thing that can happen in that meeting is for the group to promptly agree on you. That might be because of very visible mistakes you've made, disagreements you've fomented, or chaos you've caused. Avoiding the label at that point is difficult or impossible. No one around the table will rush to your defense. But it's just as bad if the group says, "Who?" — for them to be unaware of what you've done and the impact you've had. Your manager might defend you, but without support, you're in trouble. Even decades of hitting KPIs cannot insulate you if you're doing it in isolation. The way to avoid this is to make sure you're well known. Fortunately, there are several ways to do that. Volunteer for visible projects. Offer to be the face of the work outside your team. Make that presentation to the VP. Find ways to highlight your work well outside your immediate team. Volunteer to be the liaison between your team and the groups it's dependent on. Raise your hand to participate in those random companywide initiatives that always come up. Stretch your impact by working for different people, in different groups, in very different parts of the organization — even if they're unusual or off your perceived career track. If you can't actually move to other teams, make connections there. Look for ways to connect with your boss's peers and the people who work for them.

Title: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA):A Comprehensive Guide

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), often referred to as “the Dow,” is one of the most widely recognized stock market indices in the world. It serves as a barometer for the overall health of the U.S. stock market and, by extension, the broader economy. This article provides a detailed overview of the DJIA, its history, composition, calculation, significance, and its role in global finance. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a thorough understanding of why the DJIA is a cornerstone of financial markets. The DJIA is a price-weighted index that tracks the performance of 30 large, publicly-owned companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. These companies are leaders in their respective industries and are considered blue-chip stocks, representing a significant portion of the U.S. economy. The index is maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, a joint venture between S&P Global, CME Group, and News Corp. Unlike other indices like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq Composite, which are weighted by market capitalization, the DJIA is weighted by the price of its constituent stocks. This means that higher-priced stocks have a greater influence on the index’s movements. The DJIA was created in 1896 by Charles Dow, co-founder of Dow Jones & Company, and his business partner, Edward Jones. Initially, the index included just 12 companies, primarily from industrial sectors such as railroads, cotton, gas, and sugar. The goal was to provide a simple way to gauge the performance of the U.S. stock market. Over time, the index evolved to reflect changes in the economy. By 1928, the DJIA expanded to include 30 companies, a number that remains unchanged today. The composition of the index has also shifted to include companies from a broader range of industries, such as technology, healthcare, and consumer goods. The DJIA is a price-weighted index, meaning that stocks with higher prices have a greater impact on the index’s value. The formula for calculating the DJIA is: DJIA=∑(Prices of the 30 Stocks)DivisorDJIA=Divisor∑(Prices of the 30 Stocks)​ The divisor is a number that adjusts for stock splits, dividends, and other corporate actions to ensure the index remains consistent over time. The divisor is periodically updated to maintain the index’s continuity. For example, if the combined price of the 30 stocks is $5,000 and the divisor is 0.15, the DJIA would be calculated as: DJIA=50000.15=33,333.33DJIA=0.155000​=33,333.33 The DJIA includes 30 companies that are leaders in their industries. These companies are selected by the Averages Committee, which considers factors such as market capitalization, reputation, and sector representation. Some of the well-known companies in the DJIA include: The index is periodically updated to reflect changes in the economy. For example, in 2020, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell were added to the index, replacing ExxonMobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies. The DJIA is often used as a proxy for the overall health of the U.S. economy. When the index rises, it is generally interpreted as a sign of economic growth and investor confidence. Conversely, a declining DJIA may indicate economic uncertainty or recession. The DJIA is closely watched by investors, analysts, and policymakers. Movements in the index can influence investor sentiment and drive market trends. As one of the oldest stock market indices, the DJIA provides a historical benchmark for comparing current market performance to past trends. While the DJIA focuses on U.S. companies, its performance has a global impact. Many international investors use the index as a gauge for U.S. market conditions. The S&P 500 includes 500 companies and is weighted by market capitalization, making it a more comprehensive representation of the U.S. stock market. The Nasdaq Composite focuses on technology and growth-oriented companies, with over 3,000 constituents. It is also market-cap weighted. The Russell 2000 tracks small-cap companies, providing insight into the performance of smaller businesses. Investors can gain exposure to the DJIA through: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) remains one of the most influential and widely followed stock market indices in the world. Despite its limitations, it provides valuable insights into the performance of the U.S. economy and serves as a key benchmark for investors. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a beginner, understanding the DJIA is essential for navigating the complexities of the financial markets.

We need your help now Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open. You are visiting us because we have something you value. Independent, unbiased news that tells the truth. Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. SCAM ADVERTISEMENTS THAT use artificial intelligence to masquerade as independent shops in Ireland are continuing to run online, despite previous complaints about similar cons. The ads, various versions of which are running on Meta platforms Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, appeal to the consumer’s sympathy, citing financial hardship, break-ins or tragic fires as the reason for the closure of the ‘family-run’ stores. One shop, ‘Walsh Kildare’, has multiple ads running. One claims they are closing down because of a recent fire, while another says they’re closing because of a break-in. The websites the ads link to are only a few months old and people who have purchased from them say the goods are cheap and come from China, not Ireland. It’s a new take on scam ads that have been around for months, where text and images are generated by artificial intelligence, some with more convincing results than others. An ad for 'Walsh Kildare', which claims to be closing down after a break in Some of the ads have obvious AI generated images. This can be identified by dramatic imagery, bad spelling on signs and inconsistent details. Other ads use generic stock photos of shops, people and clothing. An Instagram story for Aidens Kildare that has a 'closure sale' sign spelled incorrectly Instagram Instagram When you search for the shops on Google, no physical store shows up. They also don’t have a physical address on the website. When looking at the Facebook pages that posted the ads, you can see under ‘page transparency’ that they’re not moderated from an Irish location, but rather countries such as the United States and Vietnam. Users can report ads they believe violate Meta’s policies by clicking the three dots in the upper right hand corner of the ad. The scams go against Meta’s rules. It claims it doesn’t “allow advertisers to run ads that promote products, services, schemes or offers that use identified deceptive or misleading practices, including scams to take money from people or access personal information”. Meta declined to comment on the continuous presence of the ads on its platforms. An Instagram ad for 'Byrne Cork'. There is no store with this name in Cork Aidens Kildare is another fake shop that is “closing down”. Its site, aidenskildare.com, was created less than five months ago, according to a domain age checker. Advertisement The quality of the clothing has been described as “dire” on Trustpilot, and several people say they waited months for a refund, or weren’t given one at all. On Trustpilot, where customers can leave reviews of companies, 97% of people gave “Aidan’s Kildare” a 1-star rating (the lowest one can give), with several customers accusing the shop of scamming. “Total scammers!! You will receive junk from China,” they wrote. “They say you can keep item and they’ll give you 30% off next purchase! When you finally get a return address it’s in China and you have to pay to return, and even with tracking, they say they haven’t received it.” Another unhappy customer wrote: ”Avoid this store when you see advert on Facebook or elsewhere!!! Bloody scammers pretending to be an Irish company. “Took 1 month for sub standard jackets to arrive from China. My arms couldn’t even get through the ill- fitted cheap quality clothes.” One customer said Aidan’s Kildare is “false advertising”, as there’s “no such shop in Kildare”. 'Moda Kildare' website, which is four months old Moda Kildare is another shop that operates using the same scamming techniques. Its logo has the colours of the Irish flag underneath it, but customers say it’s not based in Ireland at all. Its website was created only four months ago, and reviews report it selling “cheap crap” at a relatively high price. The fake websites are an example of dropshipping, where a seller accepts orders without keeping stock on hand or having a physical shop. The seller transfers the orders and their shipment details either to the manufacturer, a wholesaler, another retailer, or a fulfillment house, which then ships the goods directly to the customer. The Journal previously asked the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) about what a person should do if they think they have been duped by one of these websites. The commission said that anyone who believes they have been scammed should immediately contact their bank or credit card issuer, who can place their account and card on hold while they investigate the problem. Anyone who has been caught by a scam should contact Gardaí, who have advice about online shopping fraud and how to avoid scams on their website. Coimisiún na Meán, which regulates online platforms in Ireland, also said that when users discover something that they think is illegal or against a platform’s rules, they should report it to the relevant platform. If a person can’t find a way to do this or if they’re unhappy with how the platform has responded to them, they can contact the commission.

Title: Airbnb Stock Surged 14% As Consumers Trust AI And Travel Tech

On January 2nd, I made a bold prediction in Forbes that Airbnb would change the way we travel in 2025. And on Valentine’s Day Airbnb’s stock surged 14% in a single day. For a larger travel brand that’s an unusual jump in market capitalization. NEW YORK - JUNE 7: Tourists take pictures June 7, 2012 of the Wall Street bull several blocks from ... [+] the New York Stock Exchange in New York City. (Photo by Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images) Can AI allow consumers increased access to localize their journey? You bet. It can increase the total size of the travel pie and potentially enable consumers to shift more easily from one brand to another. According to Kayak’s CEO Steve Hafner, 2025 is expected to witness a pivotal shift where the first successful commercial agreement between an AI engine and a major travel player could act like "a dam breaking." Disruptor brands have the potential to take share as the adoption of new technology increases access. According to NerdWallet, Marriott is one of the best known loyalty brands in the world. I’ll confess I have been a heavy Marriott user and so are millions of Marriott loyalists. With over 210 Million members in the aggregate their size in numbers would approximate the country of Brazil which is the 7th largest country in the world. Brazil’s population and Marriott’s membership are similar. But am I truly loyal? I stay at Marriott on probably 80% or more of my travel. I am paying for that with a company credit card or rebilling my clients. My stays are usually 1-3 nights and the brand nearly always delivers a great customer experience in a location that matters a lot at a price point that is less important. I don’t want to overspend but I have relatively high price elasticity. What happens when I want to stay somewhere 4-7 nights and don’t require the restaurant and pool at the hotel? I am paying for all of the overhead at the hotel I really like. If I’m staying longer and want to explore the local environment the location matters just as much but the price starts to become a bigger factor. TEL AVIV, ISRAEL - JANUARY 24: An Israeli man uses the Vivino wine app on his Samsung mobile phone ... [+] to find out more information about the wine being served at a tasting of wines from France's southern Rhone region on January 24, 2018 near Tel Aviv, Israel. Vivino calls itself the world’s most popular wine community and most downloaded mobile wine app with 28 million users contribute ratings for millions of wines from around the globe to create the largest wine library in the world. The wine is Domaine d'Ouréa winery's Gigondas 2015 vintage, a blend of 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah grapes. (Photo by David Silverman/Getty Images) My thesis is a bit different than many on Airbnb. As a strategy and innovation professional I like to look at brand permission. A brief explanation on brand permission is “would consumers trust your brand and how far will that trust extend?” When you innovate on need states, use cases, palette states, dayparts or other factors specific to travel, brand permission becomes a critical factor. For example, I may trust Nike to introduce a new running shoe or even apparel, but I may not consider Nike if they create a financial planning service. Nike’s brand permission is high and certainly allows them to move from athletic shoes to apparel and even to hard goods. But it doesn’t mean Nike can just open a bank, operate an airplane or buy a beer brand that their raving fans will trust. In the case of a younger consumer, Gen Z often looks at the following factors related to travel and travel lodging: “AI can help travelers quickly sort through their preferences and seamlessly stitch together what has traditionally been a very siloed experience into a cohesive plan,” said Mindtrip CEO Andy Moss. “In 2025, this capability will be supercharged as we enter the early days of agentic booking and voice-to-voice interactions, making anything possible.” I love brands that have the potential to create an unfair advantage. Think about brands that often create unfair advantage by building a more unique business model: Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Chewy and others. Brands that have more indirect competitors and fewer direct competitors often fit the category of “unfair advantage.” So while I’m open to the idea of couch surfing to save a lot on my lodging expense I haven’t pursued it in my decades of business and leisure travel. My alternatives are largely hotels, VRBO or Airbnb. I think it would be super inexpensive to couch surf. I also absolutely relish a stay at a Ritz Carlton but would I stay for a week if the cost was materially different, I’m paying for it and the location was materially the same as the indirect alternatives? In my view, Airbnb will create high value-added partnerships that are both innovative and align to the brands value proposition. Imagine if Airbnb could help you: Airbnb doesn’t have to build out all the technology, but they have to “localize” the brand and help the consumer achieve a better experience, save them a little time, put a few extra bucks in their pocket and have a more local and authentic experience. "Airbnb has a unique opportunity in that their brand is ultimately 'controlled’ by more than 5 million hosts. This gives them the opportunity to win or lose based on how well they deliver on their brand promise and localize the experience. As we move into more shared brand models, this will become crucial." Nancy A Shenker, Publisher of BleisureLiving.com. “Our strong Q4 results are a testament to a ton of hard work from our teams,” remarked Dave Stephenson Airbnb Chief Business Officer. I think in addition to hard work Airbnb has built an unfair advantage that will appeal to discretionary, leisure travelers. Time will tell but I’d bet on Airbnb’s ability to leverage their brand permission as well as localize the consumer journey. With the AI tail winds creating a bigger travel pie as well as increased access for tech savvy consumers, we may be hearing from Airbnb again.

Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin told employees Thursday it would lay off about 10% of its workforce.The company has more than 10,000 employees, with a major presence on the Space Coast at its rocket factory adjacent Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex where it constructs its New Glenn rocket. The rocker had a successful debut launch last month.The number of positions that would be affected in Florida was not announced, but it also has major operations in Alabama, Texas and Washington where the company is headquartered.In a letter to employees obtained by the Orlando Sentinel sent by company CEO Dave Limp, he said much of the workforce reduction was due to excessive management built up over the last few years.“Our primary focus in 2025 and beyond is to scale our manufacturing output and launch cadence with speed, decisiveness, and efficiency for our customers,” Limp wrote.That would include more buildup of its New Glenn rockets that launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station’s Launch Complex 36, but also its smaller suborbital New Shepard rocket from Texas. The company also designs and will build its new Blue Moon lunar lander at its Brevard County facilities.“We grew and hired incredibly fast in the last few years, and with that growth came more bureaucracy and less focus than we needed,” Limp said. “It also became clear that the makeup of our organization must change to ensure our roles are best aligned with executing these priorities.”He said the layoffs meant eliminating some engineering, research and development, and “thinning out our layers of management.” Limp, a former Amazon executive, took over the CEO role in late 2023. At the time, the company said it had $10 billion in customer orders and more than 10,000 employees.He said affected employees would be notified by Thursday morning while employees being retained would also receive an email confirming their continued employment.Despite the layoffs, Limp said the company would actually continue to hire hundreds of positions to support the programs where it will remain focused.“Let me add that I am extremely confident in the enormous opportunities in front of us and have never been more optimistic about our mission,” he said. “We will be a stronger, faster, and more customer-focused company that consistently meets and exceeds our commitments.”He said 2025 remains bullish with a planned mission to land on the moon with a test version of Blue Moon and flying more New Glenn and New Shepard missions.New Glenn is looking to become certified by Space Force so it can compete for lucrative national security missions.

Title: Nvidia Earnings: What To Know About The Stock Before The Upcoming Report
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/nvidia-earnings-what-to-know-stock-report-q1-2025/
Time Published: 2025-02-15T18:00:00Z

While recent developments have introduced some uncertainty, the fundamental drivers of Nvidia's ... [+] growth remain robust. As the world’s largest semiconductor company prepares to release its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 (ending January 31, 2025) results post-market close on February 26, 2025, all eyes are on Nvidia Corporation (NVDA). With a staggering market capitalization of $3.4 trillion, the Santa Clara-based tech giant has become synonymous with the AI revolution, transforming from a gaming-focused GPU maker into a full-stack computing powerhouse reshaping global industries. The upcoming earnings report comes at a crucial time for Nvidia, as investors seek clarity on whether the company can maintain its extraordinary growth trajectory amid emerging competition and evolving market dynamics. This analysis explores what investors should know before this pivotal earnings announcement. The artificial intelligence landscape witnessed significant shifts in early 2025, marked by the emergence of new players and technological breakthroughs. One of the most notable developments has been the rise of the Chinese research lab DeepSeek, which demonstrated the ability to train competitive AI models at a fraction of the traditional computing power requirements, challenging conventional assumptions about AI infrastructure needs. Despite these disruptions, major tech companies have doubled their AI investments. Industry giants like Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) have announced record-breaking capital expenditure plans for 2025, with Meta planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure (up from $39.2 billion last year), Alphabet projecting $75 billion in capital expenditures. Amazon potentially exceeds $100 billion in AI-related investments Nvidia’s stock has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging 136.7% over the past 52 weeks and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index's 25% gain and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's 17.9% return. However, the stock trades approximately 11% below its early January 2025 record high, following concerns about DeepSeek's technological breakthrough. The company's financial performance has been equally impressive, with its most recent quarterly results showcasing the tremendous demand for AI computing solutions. In fiscal Q3 2025, Nvidia reported record Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, representing a 112% year-over-year increase. Total revenues reached an all-time high of $35.1 billion, up 93.6% from the previous year, while net income grew by 108.9% to $19.3 billion. Current market sentiment remains decisively positive, with 36 out of 43 analysts maintaining "Strong Buy" ratings on the stock. The mean price target of $176.55 suggests a potential 25.4% upside from current levels, reflecting continued optimism about Nvidia’s growth prospects. The primary catalyst driving Nvidia's outlook continues to be the unprecedented demand for AI computing infrastructure. The company's latest Blackwell architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72 system, offers performance capabilities that are 30 times faster than previous generations for AI inference tasks, positioning Nvidia to maintain its market leadership. The company's dominant position in the data center GPU market, where it captured an astounding 98% market share in 2023, provides a strong foundation for continued growth. The H100 GPU was the hottest AI data center chip globally in 2023, later superseded by the H200 and now by the entirely new generation of GPUs based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture. CEO Jensen Huang's recent comment about "insane" demand following Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024 suggests a strong market reception, with sales reportedly meeting high expectations. Major customers' aggressive infrastructure expansion plans further support the outlook for sustained demand growth. Analysts expect NVIDIA to report EPS of $0.79 for the upcoming quarter, reflecting a 61.2% year-over-year increase from last year’s $0.49. The consensus revenue forecast of $38.1 billion exceeds management's guidance of $37.5 billion, signaling market confidence in NVIDIA's ability to outperform expectations. The company has consistently delivered earnings surprises, beating estimates by: Looking ahead to fiscal 2026, analysts project 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth, with earnings expected to reach $3.98 per share, up from $2.77 in fiscal 2025. Longer-term forecasts see EPS climbing to $4.92 in 2027 and $6.26 in 2028, reflecting continued momentum in AI-driven growth. Wall Street focuses on the company's guidance for fiscal 2026's first quarter, with analysts forecasting nearly $42 billion in revenue. If management's guidance tops this number, it could help alleviate concerns about the DeepSeek development's impact on demand. Key factors could significantly influence Nvidia's upcoming earnings report and market reaction. Each element warrants careful consideration as investors position themselves ahead of the announcement. The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet the surging demand for its products. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, its ability to secure sufficient manufacturing capacity and maintain efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting the ambitious growth expectations set by Wall Street. The company's relationships with key manufacturing partners and supply chain management strategies will be particularly important as it ramps production of its new Blackwell-based products while maintaining a supply of existing high-demand components. DeepSeek's recent announcement that it successfully trained competitive AI models for just $5.6 million, using older-generation GPUs, has raised questions about the necessity of cutting-edge hardware for AI development. However, major customer commentary suggests that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, particularly as newer AI models require more computational power for operation. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that inference workloads are now consuming increasing computing power as newer AI models spend more time "thinking" (test-time scaling). This perspective from one of Nvidia's largest customers helps contextualize the evolving nature of AI infrastructure requirements. While AI and data center applications have dominated recent discussions, Nvidia's gaming business remains significant. The gaming market's health and potential cryptocurrency mining demand could impact overall results. However, these factors have become less important given the overwhelming significance of data center revenue, which accounts for approximately 88% of total revenue. Nvidia's stock presents several compelling opportunities for investors. The company's current valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 51.1, represent a 13% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio 59.2. Based on forward earnings expectations for fiscal 2026 of $4.44 per share, the stock trades at an even more attractive forward P/E of 29.2. This valuation gap suggests significant potential upside, as the stock would need to appreciate by 102% just to trade in line with its historical average P/E ratio, assuming current earnings forecasts prove accurate. Major tech companies' massive capital expenditure commitments suggest sustained strong demand for Nvidia's products through 2025 and beyond. This provides a clear pathway for continued revenue growth and potential market share expansion in the AI infrastructure market. Despite the positive outlook, investors should consider several risk factors. The emergence of efficient training methods demonstrated by DeepSeek could potentially impact demand for high-end GPUs, particularly if similar approaches gain widespread adoption. The stock's high valuation, even at current discounted levels, leaves little room for execution missteps. Any indication of slowing growth or margin pressure could lead to significant price volatility, as evidenced by the 7% decline following the company's Q3 earnings release in November 2024, despite strong results. Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. While Nvidia's market position remains strong, maintaining its current market share may become increasingly challenging. Bottom Line Nvidia's upcoming earnings report represents a crucial moment for the company and the broader AI industry. While recent developments have introduced some uncertainty, the fundamental drivers of Nvidia's growth remain robust.

While recent developments have introduced some uncertainty, the fundamental drivers of Nvidia's ... [+] growth remain robust. As the world’s largest semiconductor company prepares to release its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 (ending January 31, 2025) results post-market close on February 26, 2025, all eyes are on Nvidia Corporation (NVDA). With a staggering market capitalization of $3.4 trillion, the Santa Clara-based tech giant has become synonymous with the AI revolution, transforming from a gaming-focused GPU maker into a full-stack computing powerhouse reshaping global industries. The upcoming earnings report comes at a crucial time for Nvidia, as investors seek clarity on whether the company can maintain its extraordinary growth trajectory amid emerging competition and evolving market dynamics. This analysis explores what investors should know before this pivotal earnings announcement. The artificial intelligence landscape witnessed significant shifts in early 2025, marked by the emergence of new players and technological breakthroughs. One of the most notable developments has been the rise of the Chinese research lab DeepSeek, which demonstrated the ability to train competitive AI models at a fraction of the traditional computing power requirements, challenging conventional assumptions about AI infrastructure needs. Despite these disruptions, major tech companies have doubled their AI investments. Industry giants like Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) have announced record-breaking capital expenditure plans for 2025, with Meta planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure (up from $39.2 billion last year), Alphabet projecting $75 billion in capital expenditures. Amazon potentially exceeds $100 billion in AI-related investments Nvidia’s stock has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging 136.7% over the past 52 weeks and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index's 25% gain and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's 17.9% return. However, the stock trades approximately 11% below its early January 2025 record high, following concerns about DeepSeek's technological breakthrough. The company's financial performance has been equally impressive, with its most recent quarterly results showcasing the tremendous demand for AI computing solutions. In fiscal Q3 2025, Nvidia reported record Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, representing a 112% year-over-year increase. Total revenues reached an all-time high of $35.1 billion, up 93.6% from the previous year, while net income grew by 108.9% to $19.3 billion. Current market sentiment remains decisively positive, with 36 out of 43 analysts maintaining "Strong Buy" ratings on the stock. The mean price target of $176.55 suggests a potential 25.4% upside from current levels, reflecting continued optimism about Nvidia’s growth prospects. The primary catalyst driving Nvidia's outlook continues to be the unprecedented demand for AI computing infrastructure. The company's latest Blackwell architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72 system, offers performance capabilities that are 30 times faster than previous generations for AI inference tasks, positioning Nvidia to maintain its market leadership. The company's dominant position in the data center GPU market, where it captured an astounding 98% market share in 2023, provides a strong foundation for continued growth. The H100 GPU was the hottest AI data center chip globally in 2023, later superseded by the H200 and now by the entirely new generation of GPUs based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture. CEO Jensen Huang's recent comment about "insane" demand following Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024 suggests a strong market reception, with sales reportedly meeting high expectations. Major customers' aggressive infrastructure expansion plans further support the outlook for sustained demand growth. Analysts expect NVIDIA to report EPS of $0.79 for the upcoming quarter, reflecting a 61.2% year-over-year increase from last year’s $0.49. The consensus revenue forecast of $38.1 billion exceeds management's guidance of $37.5 billion, signaling market confidence in NVIDIA's ability to outperform expectations. The company has consistently delivered earnings surprises, beating estimates by: Looking ahead to fiscal 2026, analysts project 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth, with earnings expected to reach $3.98 per share, up from $2.77 in fiscal 2025. Longer-term forecasts see EPS climbing to $4.92 in 2027 and $6.26 in 2028, reflecting continued momentum in AI-driven growth. Wall Street focuses on the company's guidance for fiscal 2026's first quarter, with analysts forecasting nearly $42 billion in revenue. If management's guidance tops this number, it could help alleviate concerns about the DeepSeek development's impact on demand. Key factors could significantly influence Nvidia's upcoming earnings report and market reaction. Each element warrants careful consideration as investors position themselves ahead of the announcement. The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet the surging demand for its products. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, its ability to secure sufficient manufacturing capacity and maintain efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting the ambitious growth expectations set by Wall Street. The company's relationships with key manufacturing partners and supply chain management strategies will be particularly important as it ramps production of its new Blackwell-based products while maintaining a supply of existing high-demand components. DeepSeek's recent announcement that it successfully trained competitive AI models for just $5.6 million, using older-generation GPUs, has raised questions about the necessity of cutting-edge hardware for AI development. However, major customer commentary suggests that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, particularly as newer AI models require more computational power for operation. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that inference workloads are now consuming increasing computing power as newer AI models spend more time "thinking" (test-time scaling). This perspective from one of Nvidia's largest customers helps contextualize the evolving nature of AI infrastructure requirements. While AI and data center applications have dominated recent discussions, Nvidia's gaming business remains significant. The gaming market's health and potential cryptocurrency mining demand could impact overall results. However, these factors have become less important given the overwhelming significance of data center revenue, which accounts for approximately 88% of total revenue. Nvidia's stock presents several compelling opportunities for investors. The company's current valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 51.1, represent a 13% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio 59.2. Based on forward earnings expectations for fiscal 2026 of $4.44 per share, the stock trades at an even more attractive forward P/E of 29.2. This valuation gap suggests significant potential upside, as the stock would need to appreciate by 102% just to trade in line with its historical average P/E ratio, assuming current earnings forecasts prove accurate. Major tech companies' massive capital expenditure commitments suggest sustained strong demand for Nvidia's products through 2025 and beyond. This provides a clear pathway for continued revenue growth and potential market share expansion in the AI infrastructure market. Despite the positive outlook, investors should consider several risk factors. The emergence of efficient training methods demonstrated by DeepSeek could potentially impact demand for high-end GPUs, particularly if similar approaches gain widespread adoption. The stock's high valuation, even at current discounted levels, leaves little room for execution missteps. Any indication of slowing growth or margin pressure could lead to significant price volatility, as evidenced by the 7% decline following the company's Q3 earnings release in November 2024, despite strong results. Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. While Nvidia's market position remains strong, maintaining its current market share may become increasingly challenging. Bottom Line Nvidia's upcoming earnings report represents a crucial moment for the company and the broader AI industry. While recent developments have introduced some uncertainty, the fundamental drivers of Nvidia's growth remain robust. Strong customer commitments, continuous innovation, and attractive valuation metrics suggest the company is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in AI computing infrastructure.

Warren Buffett added one new stock to Berkshire Hathaway's publicly-traded equity portfolio, while ... [+] eliminating three holdings. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK/A, BRK/B) fourth-quarter 13F was filed after the market closed on Valentine’s Day, February 14. This regulatory filing gives us a quarterly opportunity to observe what Warren Buffett and his investment team of Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are doing within Berkshire’s publicly traded equity portfolio. Berkshire has a large stable of wholly-owned entities, but this report provides us with the details of the U.S. publicly traded stock portion of their investments. Berkshire’s fourth-quarter earnings report, containing Warren Buffett’s annual letter and information about the extensive portfolio of wholly-owned operating companies, is expected on Saturday, February 22. Berkshire’s $267 billion investment portfolio consists of 38 companies, down two from last quarter. Berkshire was likely a net seller of publicly traded stocks during the quarter. The top five holdings, in order of the size of holding, are Apple (AAPL), American Express (AXP), Bank of America (BAC), Coca-Cola (KO), and Chevron (CVX). The top five holdings account for almost 71% of the total portfolio, down from 76% in the first quarter. The investment portfolio remains very concentrated, with nearly 90% of assets in the top ten holdings. Percent Of Berkshire Hathaway's $267 Billion Portfolio: 38 Total Holdings Notably, Berkshire stopped paring its Apple (AAPL) position in the fourth quarter. Before the sales in 2024, Apple stock comprised over 50% of its publicly traded portfolio, but it remains the most significant holding at around 28%. The Berkshire portfolio was overweight technology due to its massive Apple stake, but the selling in 2024 has taken technology to a slight underweight. Despite the trimming of Bank of America (BAC), Capital One Financial (COF), Citigroup (C), and Nu Holdings (NU), the financial sector is the most significant overweight in the portfolio at almost 40% of assets. Due to its top five holdings, plus Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Kraft Heinz (KHC), the portfolio remains considerably overweight in consumer staples and energy relative to the S&P 500. Berkshire controls 28% of the outstanding shares in Occidental, which, combined with Chevron, leads to a significant energy sector overweight. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Berkshire has only one small holding in the industrial sector and no real estate companies or utilities. However, Berkshire’s wholly-owned entities include a large railroad, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, and multiple regulated utilities and pipelines. Holdings By Sector Because the 13F does not include international stocks, Berkshire Hathaway initially announced the acquisition of about 5% of five Japanese trading companies at the end of August 2020. These holdings are Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co. Ltd., and Sumitomo Corp. Buffett revealed in April 2023 that Berkshire increased its stakes in these companies to 7.4%. Buffett indicated that these were intended to be long-term holdings, and Berkshire may still increase its stake to 9.9%. Berkshire added one new holding, Constellation Brands (STZ). At a value of over $1.2 billion and the nineteenth largest holding, it was a decent-sized addition to the portfolio, accounting for almost half a percent of assets. Constellation is best known for owning the rights to Corona and Modelo beers in the U.S., but it also owns some wine and spirits brands. Beer accounts for about 80% of their sales. In January, the company reported worse-than-expected quarterly earnings and lowered its outlook for the year. Potential tariffs on Mexico could negatively impact its Mexican beer earnings. In addition, there are fears that the GLP-1 diet drugs and a growing preference for cannabis could weigh on the long-term outlook of its alcohol brands. On the other hand, the stock is now selling for a multi-year low in valuation across several metrics. Berkshire added to its positions in Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Pool Corporation (POOL), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Verisign (VRSN), and Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI). Ulta Beauty (ULTA) was eliminated from the portfolio in the quarter after being trimmed last quarter. Notably, Ulta Beauty was newly added to the portfolio in the second quarter of 2024. Minor holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were also jettisoned. Within financials, Berkshire trimmed its Citigroup (C), Capital One Financial (COF), Bank of America (BAC), and NU Holdings (NU). Warren Buffett is regarded as one of the greatest bank stock investors ever. Hence, the continued reduction in exposure to the banking sector is notable, but almost 40% of the stock portfolio remains in financial companies. Berkshire also reduced its positions in T-Mobile (TMUS), Charter Communications (CHTR), Liberty Media — Formula One (FWONK), and Louisiana-Pacific (LPX). This analysis looks at the Berkshire portfolio across a host of measures, including 12-month forward estimated: price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), return-on-equity (ROE), enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA), price-to-book (P/B), dividend yield, current debt-to-EBITDA, current free cash flow yield, current operating margin, and long-term earnings-per-share growth consensus estimates. Portfolio Valuation Metrics Overall, the Berkshire portfolio analysis reflects a cheaper price-to-earnings valuation than the S&P 500 while having superior profitability as measured by return on equity and operating margin with similar debt levels. The long-term (next 3 to 5 years) consensus earnings-per-share growth rate is expected to be lower than the S&P 500. Buffett’s preference for high-quality companies that generate significant cash flows is evident from the better profitability metrics combined with a superior free cash flow yield. Berkshire was likely a net seller of stocks in its portfolio for the ninth quarter in a row, with an estimated net sales of about $5 billion in publicly traded stocks. The exact value of stock moves will be disclosed with Saturday’s earnings release. Between the continued stock sales and Berkshire’s massive stockpile of cash, Buffett seems unable to find enough attractive acquisition targets in his circle of competence and at a valuation he is willing to pay. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and other stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies. I am a long-time Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and worked for Salomon Brothers when Warren Buffett became Chairman and CEO.

Before the sales in 2024, Apple stock comprised over 50% of its publicly traded portfolio, but it remains the most significant holding at around 28%. The Berkshire portfolio was overweight technology due to its massive Apple stake, but the selling in 2024 has taken technology to a slight underweight. Despite the trimming of Bank of America (BAC), Capital One Financial (COF), Citigroup (C), and Nu Holdings (NU), the financial sector is the most significant overweight in the portfolio at almost 40% of assets. Due to its top five holdings, plus Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Kraft Heinz (KHC), the portfolio remains considerably overweight in consumer staples and energy relative to the S&P 500. Berkshire controls 28% of the outstanding shares in Occidental, which, combined with Chevron, leads to a significant energy sector overweight. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Berkshire has only one small holding in the industrial sector and no real estate companies or utilities. However, Berkshire’s wholly-owned entities include a large railroad, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, and multiple regulated utilities and pipelines. Holdings By Sector Because the 13F does not include international stocks, Berkshire Hathaway initially announced the acquisition of about 5% of five Japanese trading companies at the end of August 2020. These holdings are Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co. Ltd., and Sumitomo Corp. Buffett revealed in April 2023 that Berkshire increased its stakes in these companies to 7.4%. Buffett indicated that these were intended to be long-term holdings, and Berkshire may still increase its stake to 9.9%. Berkshire added one new holding, Constellation Brands (STZ). At a value of over $1.2 billion and the nineteenth largest holding, it was a decent-sized addition to the portfolio, accounting for almost half a percent of assets. Constellation is best known for owning the rights to Corona and Modelo beers in the U.S., but it also owns some wine and spirits brands. Beer accounts for about 80% of their sales. In January, the company reported worse-than-expected quarterly earnings and lowered its outlook for the year. Potential tariffs on Mexico could negatively impact its Mexican beer earnings. In addition, there are fears that the GLP-1 diet drugs and a growing preference for cannabis could weigh on the long-term outlook of its alcohol brands. On the other hand, the stock is now selling for a multi-year low in valuation across several metrics. Berkshire added to its positions in Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Pool Corporation (POOL), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Verisign (VRSN), and Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI). Ulta Beauty (ULTA) was eliminated from the portfolio in the quarter after being trimmed last quarter. Notably, Ulta Beauty was newly added to the portfolio in the second quarter of 2024. Minor holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were also jettisoned. Within financials, Berkshire trimmed its Citigroup (C), Capital One Financial (COF), Bank of America (BAC), and NU Holdings (NU). Warren Buffett is regarded as one of the greatest bank stock investors ever. Hence, the continued reduction in exposure to the banking sector is notable, but almost 40% of the stock portfolio remains in financial companies. Berkshire also reduced its positions in T-Mobile (TMUS), Charter Communications (CHTR), Liberty Media — Formula One (FWONK), and Louisiana-Pacific (LPX). This analysis looks at the Berkshire portfolio across a host of measures, including 12-month forward estimated: price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), return-on-equity (ROE), enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA), price-to-book (P/B), dividend yield, current debt-to-EBITDA, current free cash flow yield, current operating margin, and long-term earnings-per-share growth consensus estimates. Portfolio Valuation Metrics Overall, the Berkshire portfolio analysis reflects a cheaper price-to-earnings valuation than the S&P 500 while having superior profitability as measured by return on equity and operating margin with similar debt levels. The long-term (next 3 to 5 years) consensus earnings-per-share growth rate is expected to be lower than the S&P 500. Buffett’s preference for high-quality companies that generate significant cash flows is evident from the better profitability metrics combined with a superior free cash flow yield. Berkshire was likely a net seller of stocks in its portfolio for the ninth quarter in a row, with an estimated net sales of about $5 billion in publicly traded stocks. The exact value of stock moves will be disclosed with Saturday’s earnings release. Between the continued stock sales and Berkshire’s massive stockpile of cash, Buffett seems unable to find enough attractive acquisition targets in his circle of competence and at a valuation he is willing to pay. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and other stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies. I am a long-time Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and worked for Salomon Brothers when Warren Buffett became Chairman and CEO.

Title: It's common to compare AI developments to the Space Race, but it's far from the same

Time Published: 2025-02-15T16:00:01Z
Full Content:
On July 20, 1969, as Neil Armstrong planted his foot on the Moon, he spoke the famous words “That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” His universal words were an interesting choice given he was on the Moon to establish the dominance of the United States in space and regain the lead in the Space Race after the Soviet Union had a series of early successes such as launching the first satellite - Sputnik, put the first man and woman in space, performed the first space walk, and launched the first probe that impacted the Moon. Today, progress in space is still being made but NASA and SpaceX have a clear lead in the field, and there's not as much national urgency as we saw during the Space Race. The focus has now shifted towards what has been dubbed the AI Race by the media. The main players in this race are the United States and China. It had been assumed that the US had a several year lead on China in AI, by figures like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Less than a year after that prediction, Chinese firm DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model that was comparable to o1 from OpenAI. While OpenAI had been hiding o1 behind a paywall, DeepSeek released its reasoning model for free in its app, open sourced most of the code, and made it competitive with o1, but it cost a fraction of the price to train. DeepSeek gripped headlines for days, and it was even mentioned by President Trump. It had the United States spooked. If the AI Race wasn't on before, it certainly is now. In this editorial, I want to criticize the term AI Race. The main basis for my criticism of the term is the fact that many of the AI models that are being released, are being made open source. DeepSeek is the most famous example of an open-source model, and that's from the supposed competitor, China. American companies have already taken the code, removed the censorship Chinese law requires for its companies, and have even monetized it. While the chief American AI firm, OpenAI, is keeping its AI development a secret, Meta has made its Llama AI models open source and communities like Hugging Face are doing their best to make open source models more available and is even developing software to plug gaps, including with its Open Deep Research project. While I think it's true it could be construed as an AI Race with regards to weapons of war, I'm a lot more skeptical about the description being applied in the context of large language models, especially when it involves the significant sharing of the source code of models. In this editorial, I will look in-depth at the competition between the US and the USSR during the Space Race and the competition between the US and China in the AI Race. I will look at how they are different and outline a more constructive framework for understanding what's happening now. The Space Race got underway on July 30, 1955, when the United States declared its intent to put satellites into Earth orbit. This was reciprocated by the Russians four days later who said they would also do the same in the near future. The Space Race came as a direct result of the Cold War where the capitalist West was facing off with the communist East, which had gained ground around the world after overthrowing the Nazis and their allies in Eastern Europe during World War II and as a result of decolonization in the Global South. Building sophisticated rockets and satellites was important for both sides. The rockets could be adapted for nuclear warheads in the case of a hot war and the satellites were useful for intelligence gathering - satellites are still widely used for this today. Feats like getting to the Moon, while less directly useful in the case of war, acted like propaganda for the respective nation's economic system. For the Space Race to finally end, it took the complete collapse of the Soviet Union, after which, Russia collaborated with the US and its allies on space with projects like the International Space Station. Unlike today's AI Race where many players are releasing their source code publicly, the space programs run by the US and the USSR were both secretive and nationalized. Many details about AI advancements can be found in scientific papers too, whereas in the Space Race, there was tighter control over what information was being shared to help each of the countries keep their respective advantages. As a result of the Space Race, both countries developed their own rocket technologies, with the German V-2 rocket as the shared basis. They both developed their own satellites such as Sputnik 1 and Explorer 1, they both developed their own human spaceflight system independently, as well as their space suits and life support systems. This is very different to the AI Race where advancements in the AI space are being shared. We are even being given roundabout information from companies like OpenAI who choose not to open up their source code. The main consequences of developing technologies in silos were slowed scientific advancements, duplicated efforts, and increased geopolitical tensions. The main goals of the Space Race, aside from the military applications of the satellites and rockets, was the ability to show off which country had the best political and economic system. It also acted to give the countries more prestige when they were able to achieve milestones with the technology they had achieved. With the so-called AI Race, America is keen on maintaining its leadership for further economic benefits, and to promote its values of freedom and human rights. One significant issue we saw with DeepSeek was the embedded censorship which stopped the model from criticizing the ruling Communist Party, its leader, or its geopolitical ambitions. Finally, it’s worth pointing out that the two races are different in that the Space Race was primarily driven by the US and Russian governments, rather than private business, with largely military ends. On the other hand, the cutting edge AI tools are being developed by private companies with a focus on productivity and efficiency. It’s true that there are military applications for artificial intelligence, which are dangerous, but primarily, the concern seems to be economic. If the current situation around artificial intelligence was truly a race, we would expect businesses developing this software to hold all their secrets close to their chest, making it harder to catch up, but that is not what we are seeing. While some businesses can be categorized like this with their closed source models, organizations working on open models such as Meta, Mistral AI, DeepSeek, Alibaba, Stability AI, and Hugging Face. Even companies like Google, which have developed closed source models, have released development tools like TensorFlow to advance AI development. This level of openness seems to be a more collaborative phenomenon, rather than a competitive race. Not only are companies releasing their software as open source programs, but their research is also being published in open pre-print publications such as arXiv allowing for the greater levels of collaboration. This further detracts from the idea of an AI Race. The open publication of AI research papers means that companies from different countries are integrating the latest ideas to improve their models. Even in the case of OpenAI, which is closed source, the recent release of DeepSeek R1 impressed Sam Altman who put a special emphasis on noting what R1 delivers for the price. Now that OpenAI knows more efficient methods exist, and has R1’s code, it can make its own models more efficient and available at a lower cost to consumers. The efficient techniques used by R1 also highlights another key difference between AI competition and the Space Race - that is, it’s mainly driven by economic and commercial factors, rather than for military ends or proving if particular countries have a better economic model. Just days after the release of DeepSeek R1 and its unlimited thinking requests, suddenly OpenAI releases o3-mini for free users (it still has a limit), and in recent days, Google released its thinking version of Gemini Flash 2.0 for free users. This type of behavior is common in the AI race; charge an incredible amount of money from premium users until one player makes a new feature, such as reasoning, available for all and then the other players are forced to follow suit. While it’s true that AI does have military applications, these consumer facing generative AI bots are focused on economics - such as making money for the business that makes them and adding productivity for those who consume them. Ultimately, the AI Race narrative is an oversimplification and rather too dramatic. For the most part the development of AI and products that come as a result, are just an example of normal economic competition. In fact, the field has much more collaboration going on compared to other industries. I heard about DeepSeek a couple of days before awareness of it exploded across international news channels. Sure, it wouldn’t talk about the Communist Party of China, its leader, or the country’s territorial disputes, but it would do pretty much everything else. Not only did it scour up to a huge 50 online news sources, but it also used reasoning, in an unlimited quantity, to give me better responses. I could ask it all sorts of things such as for comprehensive stock exit strategies, I could ask it who it thought would win particular horse races, and I could get it to answer all sorts of speculative questions such as what month and year does it think humans will get to Mars. Compared to the offerings at the time from Google and OpenAI, DeepSeek stood head and shoulders above. For free users, DeepSeek was the only company offering unlimited access to the web and reasoning combined. As a result, it climbed to the top of app stores and spooked the US tech industry and investors who thought it spelt the end of the AI bubble. Unlike those inferior models from Google and OpenAI (the ones available to free users), DeepSeek R1 was an open source model. This means that the company divulges most of the inner workings of the model so that others can take and adapt it, as long as they follow any provisions set out in the open source license. While largely open source, some components remained closed including the methodologies for data collection, model training, and scaling laws. Once DeepSeek had become widely known, and name dropped by President Trump, the company started being impacted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack - the Venom DDoS Community has claimed responsibility for this attack. While DeepSeek was being attacked, Meta started dissecting the code to improve its own Llama models and Perplexity hosted an uncensored version in the US for use on its platform, though it's not unlimited like the one hosted by DeepSeek. The open source AI community, Hugging Face, has also hosted the DeepSeek R1 model on its HuggingChat platform, but this model doesn’t have as comprehensive web access like that found in the DeepSeek app. The best example of DeepSeek’s technology being monetized by American companies is in the case of Perplexity which offers a handful of R1 searches to free users before asking them to upgrade to a premium tier. By monetizing reasoning models, companies like Perplexity can limit access to its compute power so that the service remains fast for all users. This added sustainability also ensures it can continue to grow in the future. Making money and ensuring access to a stable platform is in no way at odds with the open source model, open source just means that people can share their research and tools are potentially developed quicker. Aside from the business benefits and research benefits, open sourcing models can also democratize access to AI technology. AI engineering can be a very lucrative career for anyone willing to put in the time and effort required and by opening up model source code, those who are interested, and learn more about how models are made, potentially opening up careers. It also allows tinkerers to run models on their own hardware for unlimited access and more privacy. If the AI Race was truly a race comparable to the Space Race, China wouldn’t be allowing its models to be open sourced so that American businesses can profit on them and boost America’s economy. For the most part, it is just like any other competition we see countries engaging in. I think it’s also generally a good thing that countries and businesses are being this open as it means we could reach artificial general intelligence and artificial superintelligence much faster. Just look at how the AI we currently have is contributing to fields like healthcare and material science - imagine what will be unlocked when we have AI that surpasses what humans are capable of. We will have lots of new breakthroughs in many fields which will lift up everyone’s living conditions. These more powerful AI systems will also require more power, this will likely see investments in renewable energy and nuclear energy, helping the shift away from fossil fuels. Since the early days of the generative AI era, which kicked off in November 2022 with the arrival of ChatGPT, AI companies have sought to claw back their losses from customers by offering better language models or restricting the number of requests free users can make. To attract customers, companies need to offer the best language models and avoid being overtaken by their competitors. Up to the present, OpenAI has largely been seen as the leader in the space. It has recently released the Operator web browser, which is AI operated and Deep Research. Both products are groundbreaking in terms of functionality. Other companies like Google and Meta are also trying to branch out from chatbots too, Google has developed NotebookLM which lets you upload sources such as reports and then get help from AI to sift through the massive loads of data. Meta has also started expanding its AI tools with the launch of AI-supported document editor. An important consideration for AI is the hardware that it runs on. Nvidia has been a major beneficiary in this respect because its hardware has been what’s powering models like ChatGPT. Sam Altman, head of OpenAI also expressed last year that $7 trillion was needed to overcome hardware limitations affecting AI progress. When DeepSeek R1 came along, claiming to be 27 times cheaper to run than OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model, it sent stocks in the US tumbling because there was a realization that maybe so much compute power wasn’t needed after all and also, just how the hell were AI companies planning to make money if DeepSeek was giving unlimited access to its AI and open sourcing all its code? The release of DeepSeek put pressure on OpenAI to release its new o3-mini reasoning for all users, including those who don’t pay. While Sam Altman publicly says he is excited about the competition, there are also claims that its lead is also narrowing, which could be worrying the company internally. DeepSeek R1’s launch has not been all bad news for the American players though. The popular AI search engine Perplexity was quick to add R1 to its collection of reasoning models as part of its Pro search. Free users get a handful of Pro searches per day, but to unlock more, you have to pay. The inclusion of R1 could have made the subscription more appealing, leading to increased revenues for the company. Perplexity was able to uncensor the model and host it in the US, removing any political bias concerns that exist with the DeepSeek-hosted model. At the time of writing, it’s fair to say that despite the benefits of open source models, they have not managed to surpass the proprietary leaders yet, although, they’re not too far behind. In terms of hosted services, these open source models contribute to a more competitive playing field. They also provide unique benefits such as being able to run them on local hardware, which is good for privacy and having unlimited access in terms of requests. In this editorial, I have tried to dispel the notion that what’s happening in AI today is not an AI Race comparable to the Space Race, but rather, ordinary competition, with a whole lot of collaboration. The frequent publications of AI research papers and the release of open source models like DeepSeek’s R1 stand in contrast to the largely secretive development of rockets and satellites in the Space Race, which the media tries to draw comparisons with. The development of new AI tools is moving quite rapidly with cutting edge features usually hidden behind a paywall until one of the market participants decides to release those features and the other players follow suit. Thanks to the greater sharing of information compared to developments during the Space Race, there is less reproduced effort going on and things are moving along quickly. As mentioned earlier, another difference between the Space Race and the AI competition is that the former was between governments, and the latter by private companies, seeking market share and profits. Going forward, it is unclear what will happen between the closed source AI companies like OpenAI and the open source models. Monetization of AI is an important factor as it can help companies recruit and retain the best talent in the industry, which free open models may struggle to do. According to the OpenAI Careers page, a Software Engineer (Full Stack) can earn between $160,000 and $385,000, plus offers equity. Obviously, companies like Meta and DeepSeek are able to pay these great wages despite having open models, but it does make the task easier when models are being monetized. If a company like DeepSeek with open source models does end up taking over OpenAI, it will likely happen all of a sudden with a new model landing and OpenAI not being able to respond quickly, only time will tell what happens going forward though.

The annual Art Directors Guild Awards celebrate not just the names with which cinephiles are well acquainted, the Jack Fisks and Catherine Martins, but the people who bring those designs to life on everything from blockbusters to game shows. And the 2025 Lifetime Achievement Honorees prove the huge breadth of the guild. This year, Lisa Frazza, Barbara Mesney, Dan Sweetman, and J. Dennis Washington will be honored for their contributions to their respective crafts. IndieWire spoke to all four about what their jobs entail (an ever-shifting terrain as technology continues advancing) and about some memorable titles from their filmographies before they accept their laurels at the ADG Awards February 15. Related Stories ‘Kontinental ’25’ Review: A Transylvanian Bailiff Tries to Ease Her Guilty Conscience in Radu Jude’s Droll and Biting iPhone Comedy Cooper Hoffman Teases Gregg Araki’s BDSM Dominatrix Drama ‘I Want Your Sex’: I Wanted to Be ‘Uncomfortable’ Frazza worked on hundreds of shows during her career at CBS, including “Wheel of Fortune,” “Jeopardy,” “The Price is Right,” “Dancing with the Stars,” “Survivor,” “The Young and the Restless,” and “The Bold and the Beautiful.” Before I retired [after 30 years as a scenic artist at CBS Studios], I painted and executed designs that the production designer actually designed. I followed the production designer’s wishes, and I custom-mixed colors that were needed, and I painted murals and 3-D pieces such as furniture and tables, desks. I excelled in marbleizing and faux wood grain. And I led crews who did the same thing, which was very rewarding for me. Game Shows [Years ago] on “Wheel of Fortune,” we used to do the murals, but now they do everything digitally. Things like, “You can win this trip to Hawaii.” And same thing with “The Price Is Right,” we’d do these mini murals 10 by 8 feet or whatever, and we’d paint the murals they’d show on camera. “Jeopardy,” we would do their floors. I think at the end they did special tiles. Set pieces would come into the shop in pieces, and we’d have to touch them up because they’d get beat up in transit. So we had a stock of colors for each show, well marked, very well organized. So if you need “Price Is Right” green for the door, you’d go to the “Price Is Right” shelves and find the green for the door. And if you dont have enough. “The Young and the Restless” and “The Bold and the Beautiful” When I started, we would do three rehearsals per scene. Then it went down to two rehearsals, then one rehearsal, and then they’d just wing it. If I wanted to go in and touch something up towards the end of my run, the producer would come over the loudspeaker and say, “It’s fine, Lisa”. But I had to run in during those rehearsals and touch up whatever I could that I saw on the monitor. So toward the end of my run, everything had to [start off] perfect. In a corner of the stage [were] cans of paint and brushes. And if I knew a certain scene was coming up, I’d get a 1-gallon bucket and put in paper cups of each color I might need, grab a few little brushes and a wet rag, and I’d be ready to jump in if need be. There’s no time to go over to that corner of the stage. You have to be uber-prepared. Jack Forestall, the production designer for “Bold and the Beautiful,” is going to present me with the award, and what’s so cool about that is he actually worked for me in 1983 back in Philadelphia. I worked for a shop that did the Philadelphia opera company sets, and Jack came to work there while he was going for his master’s at Temple University. Then he and his wife came out here, and the rest is history. Mesney’s extensive resume boasts 60 feature films, including “Argo,” “Hail, Caesar!,” “Gone Girl,” “Crazy, Stupid, Love,” and “Little Fockers,” while her TV credits range from “Bosch” to the Brandy “Cinderella” and “Grace & Frankie.” Most of the time, people say, “Oh, really? You did something? What did you do?” People don’t understand that, unlike in theater, where you’re aware that there’s a set and it’s like a sculpture sitting up there on stage, in film and television, the objective is to not be noticed. To not have your work be seen. We’re always doing something; it could be the smallest thing or a monumental thing. It could be, you know, an entire set, or, you know, like I remember in the old days when I started before we had all these graphic software programs. The set designers used to do the signs, too. We did all the sign work. So it’s very different now, with all that shifted away from us. But we would design the sets, and then we would design the signs. So sometimes it would just be putting up a little piece of wall or a sign or, you know, usually a director and a DP and, and the production designer go into a location and there are some modifications that have to happen for the action to occur there. And like I say, it could be anything like that up to a standing set or, you know, what Jack Fisk does out, and you know, like on the revenant or something where they’re creating whole worlds outside. It could be anything and then you know, so that’s why I tell people I’m I’m designing all this stuff So I call myself like an architect. Like a backstage architect, I’m doing the building drawings and I’m doing the models But it’s all stuff that people basically will never be aware of. “Basic Instinct” That was part of my San Francisco days. You know, I started in theater. And so I had been designing live theater for years. And I had done one other movie project prior to “Basic Instinct.” And then I had gone abroad. When I came back, I got this offer to do “Basic Instinct.” I literally [landed], and within nine hours, I was working on “Basic Instinct.” I know. It was great. That was Terry Marsh, he was the production designer. This is a good story. “Basic Instinct,” the main character is bisexual, right? That’s the whole context. And so we wanted to rent this gay bar in San Francisco. It was a beautiful location because they had all the flags and it was already set up for this shot. And the owner of that bar was willing to rent it to the company, but only if he could see the script. So they gave him the script, and the end result of that was that [he] took offense to the fact that she was a killer. It put the gay community on high alert and they basically showed up at every location we went to shoot at. We were boycotted, and they always made a lot of noise, whistles and everything. But beyond that, some of the sets were sabotaged, people were taking paint balloons and throwing them at the sets the night before we’d be shooting. My first movie, “Class Action,” also in San Francisco, was the total opposite. It went like clockwork, without a hitch, nothing went wrong. And [the crew] were all up from Hollywood, and they were saying to me, “Barbara, it’s not normally like this. Don’t think that the movie business is like this, because usually there’s some drama going on somewhere.” Sure enough, “Basic Instinct,” man. Literally every day was a crisis in the art department because something had to be fixed. Everybody, not just the art department. But we got through it, and it was a very fun project to have worked on and I met some great people. That was one of the ones where I had to knock out the sets and then get onto the signage so that the scenic artists could paint these signs, because that was the way it was done in those days. I remember doing that Chinatown set, having to draw a sign with Chinese characters. We would do them in full scale so that they could be built. And trying to get this Chinese sign created by an actual Chinese sign maker in neon so that it’s accurate. It was constantly checking and making sure that you’re being accurate because everyone’s going to see this thing on a big screen. “Twin Peaks” I got to do all the dream sequences. That was really fun, and I just remember [David Lynch and I would] go back and forth and back and forth, and he was a real detail guy. He had a very specific vision. I remember the art director came in and the production designer, Ruth, said to me, “You and he are on the same wavelength, so this is great.” They gave me all of the wacky stuff to design, basically all the stage sets for all these dream sequences, the one where he comes through the window and has to go through this old, beautiful villa where that weird thing is on the wall and the radio station and the desert. Sweetman has worked extensively on storyboards for over 100 films, including two Best Picture winners, “Braveheart” and “Birdman,” as well as “Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” “The Prestige,” and “The Nutty Professor.” Storyboards are a visual script, a tool to help the director, to guide the way through the story in general. We’re sort of guardians of the story. But what I do, you never see it on the screen. You see the thoughts and the ideas. There are so many pushes and pulls on the story that it could lose its way if one influence is too great. So, I always thought the storyboard artist helps the director visualize the thing, but he’d also keep an eye on if the story is still being true to what it was designed to be. By the time shooting starts, I’m done. When they get on the set the first day, they’re not wondering, “How are we going to shoot this?” It’s all there. So that’s the most valuable use of the skill “Braveheart” Braveheart was great. It was my first road show on location. So we went to England, Scotland, and Ireland. And I was still sort of new in the business. So this was like a big, big deal, big Hollywood experience. And so I was just trying to learn as much as I could. It was unusual for me because, like I said, usually, I’m off the picture when it starts shooting. Right. But there was enough work that I was just ahead of the shooting schedule. I was drawing stuff like three weeks ahead of filming. And I remember David Tomlin, the legendary English first AD guy, he’s going page by page. And they got through what I call the gags. The fighting maneuvers and stuff, which I kind of stayed away from because the stunt coordinator is going to come up with it. But I did do the one of the dagger in the eye. And Tomlin goes, “All right, who thought of this?” And it wasn’t as much who thought of it as how are we going to do this? It was a lot of fun memories. “Birdman” I did sort of thumbnail because Alejandro Iñárritu could visualize it, but he needed help. He goes, “Oh, the whole movie’s one shot.” I go, “What?” “Yeah, we’re going to do a one-shot movie. That’s why you’re here, because we need to find transition points.” And we need to map out what to decide howto sell it as a continued shot. He was very much with the DP kind of mapping it all out. Basically, I was just taking notes and then presenting him the work. So I wasn’t as much of an idea participant as a helpful wrist. Now retired, Washington spent 56 years in the film industry, beginning as an assistant art director on “The Exorcist II” and even serving as the second unit director on three projects. Some of his favorite projects include “Stand by Me,” “The Fugitive,” and “13 Days.” Years ago, somebody said that what I do is everything that’s out of focus. It’s a little better than that, I think! It’s creating the visual environment in the scenes. And the collaboration is important with the DP and with the production designer. “Prizzi’s Honor” I started [with John Huston] on “Victory” back in 1980 in Budapest. With Sylvester Stallone and Michael Caine in a prisoner-of-war camp. That was my first introduction to John. Totally intimidated. But I learned a lot from John. How do I make something true to the reality of the film, but at the same time make it interesting without without showing off? With John, he would he would let you find the best. There was a day on “Prizzi’s Honor” where we were doing a bookie operation for the Mafia. And I had some pictures of old research of these places and this and that. And he says, “Have you ever been to one of these?” I did a lot of research, but I didn’t actually go to one. And he brought Jack Nicholson over. And he says, “Jack, why don’t you get Rocky?” One of our mafia consultants. “Why don’t you have Rocky take Dennis over to one of these bookie gambling places and just see what it is.” And we went to some little street where there were just little nothing houses, shacks. And we went into this one and it was the same inside that it was outside: nothing. And there was a bunch of guys around, and we said, “I’d like to see the operation if that’s all right.” So I went in the back room and this whole operation in this little shack was one phone on a little table, not even a desk. That’s the whole operation. In my research, I wasn’t trying to go over the top, but I was trying to make something that had a little more weight to it. So I went back to John, and I explained what I saw over there, and he said, “Do what you were gonna do.” He just wanted to know the truth. He wants to go back to the roots of reality so that if we’re bending the rules, we know where we’re coming from and we’re not just making shit up. “The Net” Irwin Winkler was directing that, and he’s a big Hitchcock fan. There was one thing that I saw in Washington, D.C., a sculpture called The Awakening. It’s like an 80-foot-high reclining man, but he’s pulling himself out of the earth, so you see portions of him, his knees, his hands. So we had a scene at the beginning of the picture where this upstanding businessman goes to a park to have lunch, and you can tell he’s quiet, very methodical. And then he leans back and blows his brains out. I brought Erwin out there, and I said, “What if we bring him to the park bench here, and when he brings the gun up, we just crane up and reveal the statue behind him in the ground coming out?” I caught him contemplating it, and I said, “Hitchcock would have done it.” So that kind of cinched it, and it worked great. It was a nice opening to the film. By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

Title: Dating App Cover-Up: How Tinder, Hinge, and Their Corporate Owner Keep Rape Under Wraps

Full Content:
The Dating Apps Reporting Project is an 18-month investigation. It was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Centerâs AI Accountability Network and The Markup, now a part of CalMatters, and copublished with The Guardian and The 19th.Â When a young woman in Denver met up with a smiling cardiologist she matched with on the dating app Hinge, she had no way of knowing that the company behind the app had already received reports from two other women who accused him of rape. She met the 34-year-old doctor with green eyes and thinning hair at Highland Tap & Burger, a sports bar in a trendy neighborhood. It went well enough that she accepted an invitation to go back to his apartment. As she emerged from his bathroom, he handed her a tequila soda. What transpired over the next 24 hours, according to court testimony, reads like every personâs dating app nightmare. After sipping the drink, the woman started to lose control. Her memory blurred. She fell to the ground, and the man started to film her. He put her in a headlock, kissing her forehead; she struggled to free herself but managed to grab her things and leave. He followed her out the door, holding her shoes and trying to force her back inside, but she was able to call an Uber, vomiting in the car on the way home. She woke up at home, soaking wet on her bathroom floor, the key to her house still in her door. She continued vomiting for hours. When she came to, she reported the assault to Hinge. Hinge is one of more than a dozen dating apps owned by Match Group. The $8.5 billion global conglomerate also owns brands like Tinder (the worldâs most popular dating app), OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish. Match Group controls half of the worldâs online dating market, operates in 190 countries, and facilitates meetups for millions of people. Match Groupâs official safety policy states that when a user is reported for assault, âall accounts found that are associated with that user will be banned from our platforms.â So why, on the night of Jan. 25, 2023, was Stephen Matthews still on the app? Just four days before, Match Group had been alerted when another woman reported him for rape. A little more than a week later, he was reported for rape again. This time, the survivor went to the police. None of these women knew that the company had known about his violent behavior for years. He was first reported on Sept. 28, 2020. By then, Match Groupâs safety policy was already in place. Even after a police report, it took nearly two months for Matthews to be arrested â the only thing that got him off the apps. By then, at least 15 women would eventually report that Matthews had raped or drugged them. Nearly every one of them had met him on dating apps run by Match Group. On Oct. 25, 2024, a Denver judge sentenced Matthews to 158 years to life in prison after a jury convicted him of 35 counts related to drugging and sexually assaulting eight women, drugging two women, and assaulting one more for a total of 11 women. Attorneys for the women said much of that violence could have been prevented. “It is shocking that for years after receiving reports of sexual assault, Hinge continued to allow Stephen Matthews access to its platforms and actively facilitated his abuse,â said Laura Wolf, the attorney representing the woman whose police report led to the arrest. Following best practices forÂ reporting on sexual assault, the Dating Apps Reporting Project is honoring survivorsâ requests for anonymity.Â Matthewsâ attorney, Douglas Cohen, declined to comment. A letter that The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent directly to Matthews in jail went unanswered. Match Groupâs reach is so massive â its mission is âto spark meaningful connections for every single person worldwideâ â that people are more likely to meet through its apps than out at the bars, at church, or through friends. But Matthews’ case shows that even as these apps have made it easier for us to connect with a seemingly endless pool of potential lovers, they have also made it easier for people who commit sexual abuse to reach a seemingly endless number of potential targets. In 2022, a team of researchers at Brigham Young University published an analysis of hundreds of sexual assaults in Utah. They found attacks facilitated by dating apps happened faster and were more violent than when the perpetrator met the victim through other means. They also found that perpetrators who use dating apps are more likely to target vulnerable people. Almost 60 percent of sexual assault survivors self-reported a mental illness. Match Group has known for years which users have been reported for drugging, assaulting, or raping their dates since at least 2016, according to internal company documents. Since 2019, Match Groupâs central database has recorded every user reported for rape and assault across its entire suite of apps; by 2022, the system, known as Sentinel, was collecting hundreds of troubling incidents every week, company insiders say. Match Group promised in 2020 that it would release whatâs known as a transparency report â a public document that would reveal data on harm occurring on and off its platforms. If the public were aware of the scale of rape and assault on Match Group apps, they would be able to accurately assess their risk. As of February 2025, the report has not been released. Instead, as people continued to get hurt, the company dithered over what damning information should be hidden. âDo we only publish where we are required by law?â reads a slide in a 2021 presentation shown multiple times to Match Group employees as well as external safety partners. âDo we push back on how much we are required to reveal, or do we try to go beyond what is required?â No online space is risk-free. But while Match Group has long possessed the tools, financial resources, and investigative procedures necessary to make it harder for bad actors to resurface, internal documents show the company has resisted efforts to spread them across its apps, in part because safety protocols could stall corporate growth. âThe obsession with metrics and having to stick with them is frustrating and potentially dangerous,â one employee wrote in 2021 after the company learned that the investigative news nonprofit ProPublica was planning a story. âThis is not the way we were meant to work and peopleâs lives are at risk.â The same person asked their superiors: ââHow much would you personally pay to stop just one person being sexually assaulted by a date, one child being trafficked or one vulnerable person being driven to suicide by a predator?â I feel that if I asked members of our staff that question individually, they would put a high value of their own money on it – But as a group nobody is ready to hear that yet.” Since 2021, Match Group has publicly promised to improve the safety of their products and share data, but company insiders say safety has not improved. A brief hiring spree sparked by congressional and media scrutiny has been largely scaled back, according to former employees. In 2024, the remaining employees from the central trust-and-safety team Match Group set up in response to increased scrutiny were let go and their jobs outsourced to overseas contractors. Facing pressure from Wall Street, Match Group removed CEO Bernard Kim in early February 2025 as he struggled to cut costs and end the steady decline in subscribers to Match Groupâs most powerful app, Tinder. Members of Congress have repeatedly requested data from Match Group on sexual harm. In February 2020, 11 members of Congress wrote to then-CEO Shar Dubey asking for details on how the company responds to reports of sexual violence. In July 2023, two Democrats, then-Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire and Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois followed up after we inquired on the status of their efforts. The company has still not provided the data. In September 2024, the House of Representatives passed a bill that requires consumers to be notified if they have interacted with a user on a dating app who has been banned for defrauding consumers of money or personal financial information. But the bill stopped short of addressing the issue of sexual assault on the apps, and it died in the Senate. Our review of hundreds of pages of internal company documents, along with thousands of pages of court records, securities filings, and analyst reports, coupled with dozens of interviews with current and former employees and survivors of sexual violence found women who report being raped get no traction, while accused rapists like Stephen Matthews keep swiping â and assaulting. Our own testing on Match Group apps shows that as of February 2025, not much has changed. Banned Tinder users, including those reported for sexual assault, can easily rejoin or move to another Match Group dating app, all while keeping most of their key personal information exactly the same. The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent Match Group a four-page letter detailing our findings. The company responded with a short statement. The statement did not dispute that Match Group has carefully documented the extent of harm on company apps for years without sharing that information with the public. It also defended the companyâs efforts to make platforms safe. âWe recognize our role in fostering safer communities and promoting authentic and respectful connections worldwide,â the statement provided by Kayla Whaling, senior director of communications, read. âWe will always work to invest in and improve our systems, and search for ways to help our users stay safe, both online and when they connect in real life.â The company said it vigorously combats violence.Â âWe take every report of misconduct seriously, and vigilantly remove and block accounts that have violated our rules regarding this behavior,â its statement read. Our own testing found otherwise. Starting in April 2024, The Dating Apps Reporting Project created a series of Tinder accounts that we subsequently reported for sexual assault. Soon after, Tinder banned the accounts, and we started investigating how easy it would be for a banned user to create new accounts. Repeatedly, we found that users, soon after being banned, could create new Tinder accounts with the exact same name, birthday, and profile photos used on their banned accounts. Users banned from Tinder were also able to sign up for Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish without changing those personal details. To get around the Tinder ban, we used techniques commonly suggested by online guides and forums that donât require lots of technical knowledge to understand. We were able to verify three techniques that allowed banned Match Group users to repeatedly bypass being flagged when creating new accounts. In its statement, Match Group cast itself as an industry leader in deploying technology to promote safety, including âharassment-preventing AI tools, ID verification for profiles, and a portal that helps us better support and communicate with law enforcement investigating crimes. â¦ Every person deserves safe and respectful experiences. We are committed to doing the work to make dating safer on our platforms and beyond,â the statement said. Sept. 28, 2020 â the date Denver cardiologist Stephen Matthews raped a woman who reported him to Hinge â is also the date Tracey Breeden was brought on as Match Group’s head of safety and social advocacy. Breeden was a flashy hire. âWith Tracey coming on board, we are reaffirming our commitment not just to be safety leaders in the dating space, but across the entire tech sector,â then-CEO Shar Dubey said. Sporting a trademark black leather jacket and short, slick-backed hair, Breeden went by the nickname âTornadoâ during her 15-year career in law enforcement. What made her attractive to Match Group was her most recent job at Uber. She helped the global ride-hailing company revive its reputation after a series of scandals â from persistent reports of harassment of women employees to allegations that it was ignoring sexual assault that occurred during Uber rides. Breeden spearheaded a safety report in 2019 that told the public what Uber knew about nearly every problem, including nationwide reports of intoxicated drivers, traffic fatalities, and incidents of sexual violence. The report became a key metric of success for the company. In hiring Breeden, Match Group hoped to replicate this success across its portfolio of apps. “Corporations,â she said in a press release announcing her arrival, âhave a responsibility to help ensure safe experiences for their users.â Breedenâs team garnered public attention for its new safety measures, including partnerships with NGOs, optional AI-assisted photo verification, and a law enforcement portal where police and prosecutors can request data. She also fostered a partnership with Garbo, a startup that offered low-cost background checks. It launched on Tinder in 2022. Experts point out that background checks are not always reliable as they pull from outdated databases, and research suggests that most people who commit sexual abuse do not encounter the criminal justice system. For example, Matthews had no criminal record. During this time, Match Group invested $100 million into safety as a recurring cost, the company said, and boasted about Breedenâs âcentral safety team.â Her team of veteran safety professionals referred to themselves as âThe Avengers,â even donning superhero costumes at company events. But Michael Lawrie called this âsafety theater.â Lawrie worked for Match Group for nearly a decade, shaping and leading a safety team for one of the companyâs smaller brands, OkCupid. Sometimes working 80-hour weeks, he spent hours, even days, sniffing out savvy users who tried to thwart bans by creating multiple accounts. Over a 30-year career in content moderation, Lawrie said, he saw many users like Stephen Matthews. âYou’re dealing with one repeat offender. I’ve dealt with god knows how many repeat offenders,â he said. A yellow Post-it note on the side of Lawrieâs computer listed out some of his responsibilities: âRape flags. â¦ Investigate miscreants.â These days, Lawrie is trying to start an advocacy organization for content moderators and other front-line safety workers. But, he said, heâs done with dating apps. âI donât think theyâre safe enough at the moment,â he said. âTheyâre gonna get worse. â¦Iâm hoping dating sites vanish.â Lawrie said he was initially excited about Breedenâs hire. He said she spent her first few months on the job talking to each brandâs safety team, and told him that she was âvery impressedâ by the work OkCupid was doing. Each of Match Groupâs biggest apps provided their self-described strengths and weaknesses to Breedenâs team, according to an internal spreadsheet. At Hinge, these weaknesses included a âvery rudimentary warning system with no targeted comms and no follow throughâ and âno way to findâ the original profile âof a bad actor who has created multiple profiles.â Breeden was confronted with an existential problem. âOur current ban categories wonât allow us to answer the publicâs biggest question: Am I likely to be harmed on my date?â reads a slide in a presentation drafted by her team in April 2021. While each of Match Groupâs apps had a system of reporting and banning violent users, the information was disorganized, and none of the apps talked to each other. Lawrie hoped Breeden would improve safety at the company. But he quickly grew frustrated that neither she nor Match Group leadership listened to his pleas for what they really needed to make platforms safer: To hire trained â and expensive â investigators and integrate powerful moderation tools across all the apps. OkCupid already had those tools. Lawrie was using them every day. One of those was the Sentinel system, which had been up and running across Match Groupâs apps for at least five years before Breeden arrived. It works like this: When a user is banned for something serious â like sexual assault â a case is created in Sentinel with the phone number and email address associated with their account. In interviews, multiple current and former employees described how those reports circulate through each of Match Groupâs apps. The system is designed to ban anyone who uses that information. It also grabs the original profileâs IP addresses, photos, and birthdate. Such a system seems robust at first glance â but none of the Match Groupâs apps require users to provide photo identification (the kind needed to buy alcohol or board an airplane), so once a person is kicked out, they can easily start a new account with different contact information. A quick search yields scores of online forums with clear steps and suggestions for how to rejoin the apps. In addition, internal company documents show information on IP addresses, photos, and birthdate were not used to ban a user if they appear on another Match dating app. Lawrieâs team at OkCupid knew Sentinel could only do so much. So his team deployed other tools to fix its shortcomings, including one that could automatically ban a profile that was linked to a phone number, photo, or URL that had been previously banned â even if the user made an account with a different email or IP address. This tool was designed to be proactive rather than reactive, so that the profiles of alleged perpetrators like Matthews would not resurface after they had been reported. Internal company documents from 2019 and 2020 show thousands of reports of âserious physical assault,â abuse, or violence on OkCupid that were deemed serious enough to get users banned from all of Match Groupâs apps. This is among the information the company kept from the public. Breeden and Match Group leadership praised Lawrie and his team at OkCupid, he said, for their thorough investigative work and for handling some of the companyâs most difficult cases. Yet, he said, Match Group never built out a skilled, experienced investigative unit at other brands like the one he headed up at OkCupid. Under Breedenâs leadership, he said, they faced pressure to speed up investigations and train outsourced labor to use complicated moderation tools. A week after a damning article in 2021 revealed that content moderators with little training were asked to rapidly deal with violent sexual content across Match Groupâs brands, then-CEO Dubey sent out an all-staff email addressing the controversy. She CCâd Breeden, acknowledging that the brandâs safety teams were not all on equal footing. As Match Group prepared internally for the story to break, Lawrie was asked to write a report for Breeden outlining his teamâs accomplishments âto make sure when Tracey describes and acknowledges what you are doing individually to celebrate the good work that you are doing.â Lawrie used that report to protest. âMost professionals arenât judged on how many cases they can hurry through in an hour,â he wrote. The way Match Group expects its trust-and-safety and support teams to work âbasically diminishes their skills and makes them production-line workers.â Breeden declined to comment for this story, citing a nondisclosure agreement. Lawrie left the company in 2022 and said most of his small team that was ferreting out malicious users also left due to a negative workplace environment. He said much of their work was outsourced to contractors with little training and severe quotas. He now cautions anyone using a dating app to understand that theyâre not in the business of protecting users. âYou’re on your own pretty much,â he said. As Lawrie was getting pushed out of Match Group, Matthews kept appearing on the companyâs apps. One crisp fall evening in 2022, one of the Denver cardiologistâs old medical school classmates was on Hinge when her phone screen filled up with a familiar face. Matthews was being promoted on the app as a Standout, a popular profile that Hingeâs algorithm thinks youâll like. To match with a Standout, users must send the person a rose. They get one free rose a week, but they cost $3.99 a pop after that. His classmate did not send Matthews a rose. By this point, Matthews had already been reported for rape at least once to Hinge. Court documents show that he had already allegedly sexually assaulted nine women and drugged 10. Not only did the apps allow him back on, they featured Matthewsâ profile. As the COVID-19 pandemic dragged on, people got tired of forking money over for dating apps. Match Group still made a hefty profit, but its growth flatlined. Its stock cratered, losing nearly half its value between October 2021 and April 2022. That month, an analyst from J.P. Morgan wrote that the firm had received more messages about âthe underperformance of MTCH shares in recent weeks than any other topic.â In May 2022, Match ousted Dubey and installed Bernard Kim as CEO, a former executive at the gaming company Zynga that popularized viral games like âFarmVille.â While Dubey spoke frequently about trust and safety and worked closely with Breeden, Kim hardly mentioned safety when he began his time at Match Group, instead emphasizing the need for continued rapid expansion to drive long-term shareholder value. Lawrie said that Kim, with his background in gaming rather than dating apps, had no interest in love. âHe just wants to make money. Heâs just there to increase profits,â Lawrie said. âIf he’s looking at a bottom line, then it’s easier to have a lawsuit than it is to provide safety. I know which one he’s gonna pick.â Match Group declined to make Bernard Kim available for an interview. Messages sent to Kim directly went unreturned. While the tension between growth and safety exists across the tech sector, it is especially high at dating apps companies where executives have to worry about constant churn â users leaving the apps when they are no longer looking for dates. Every time Match Group delivers on its promise, it also loses customers. In February 2024, six dating app users filed what they hope will be certified as a class action lawsuit. They argue Match Group uses âaddictiveâ features to encourage compulsive use while not leading to any real increase in off-app relationships. âThe app is designed specifically to hook them, and to keep them paying subscription fees â not to help them find love,â attorney Ryan Clarkson said. Match Group filed to dismiss the lawsuit in September, noting in its quarterly report that it âwill defend vigorouslyâ against the allegations. Despite Kimâs efforts, Match Groupâs stock price continued to drop, and during that time, so did any mention of trust and safety. In over a year of quarterly investor calls, Kim only referenced safety efforts once. Employees who pushed for these initiatives were forced out or laid off, including Breeden â a leader who was so convinced of her own invincibility that she showed up to an event wielding a Captain America shield. Match Group fired its power hire in October 2022. Layoffs hit her team over the next several months. In February 2024, the remainingÂ critical investigators and law enforcement liaisons on Breedenâs central safety team were shown the door. Lawrie said group chats of former Match Group employees have been gossipping about the cutbacks. âYou’re not gonna see them taking safety seriously ever again,â he said, adding that the only thing that he thinks might change that is legislation. Four months before Matthews was arrested, a post on a Facebook group in Denver blew up, right around Christmas. Over and over again, women furiously detailed negative experiences they or their friends had with Matthews. Some women described him as âsketchy.â Others called him âterribleâ and ânot safe.â Multiple women told a similar, dark story: that they were offered drinks, blacked out, and sexually assaulted. The thread reached 150 comments. Two women wrote the same thing: that they had been waiting for someone to post about the cardiologist. The flood of Facebook comments mirrored details in the police reports released the following year. Nearly all of the 16 women included in the district attorneyâs initial complaints were offered tequila. Eight recalled playing Jenga. Six mentioned a hot tub. As these stories circulated in this small corner of the internet in December 2022, the Denver cardiologist stayed on Match Group apps. Those fortunate enough to know about the Facebook group â and who had the foresight to check for Matthews on it â would be saved from a bad date or worse. But the fact that he could still log into Tinder and Hinge left him with a pool of thousands of unsuspecting women whom he could â and would â continue to match with. The Dating Apps Reporting Project is aware of four additional women who have accused Matthews of drugging and/or raping them who were not part of the criminal complaint. Each of these women met Matthews on a Match Group app during a single year between the summers of 2020 and 2021. During the years Matthews was on their apps, Match Group hired and fired Breeden. It made loud promises on sexual violence, announced initiatives and product lines, and promised a transparency report. But it was not straight with the public, which meant the women matching with Matthews on Match Group apps were not aware of the risk they faced. Match Groupâs partnership with Garbo, the background check company, also fell apart in the summer of 2023. âItâs become clear that most online platforms arenât legitimately committed to trust and safety for their users,â Garbo wrote in a searing blog post. After spending so much energy talking about monetization, gamification, and growth, Kim began to publicly acknowledge this problem. Speaking at the Citibank conference in the fall of 2023, he said the company was investing in new features to make sure âwomen have a good experience while they’re in the product. They feel safe. They feel secure. Etc.â The âetc.â does not seem to include increased transparency about safety. Instead, in May 2023, Tinder released a âfemale-focused package,â a curated list of âhigh-quality profiles.â It is unclear how Tinder determines these high-quality matches. Hingeâs Standout feature, which is similar, had previously promoted Matthews. In fact, under Kimâs leadership, all mentions of a transparency report disappeared from the companyâs annual impact report. Ironically, this was around the same time that new legislation in Europe required tech companies to disclose reports of ânon-consensual behaviorâ and other issues. Match Group will be required to submit a transparency report to the European Union on the scope of harm on their platforms later this month. Lawmakers in India and Australia are also demanding transparency. This is exactly the situation Breeden and her team pondered three years ago. âWhat if publishing in one jurisdiction sparks a requirement in another?â read a slide in the same internal presentation where Match Groupâs trust-and-safety leaders wondered whether they should âpush back on how much [they] are required to reveal.â After Match Group published a disappointing earnings report in February 2025 that fell below analystsâ expectations, it also announced that Kim would be replaced by former Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff. Tinderâs revenue, sales, and subscribers had all gone down. As Match Group struggles to reverse its decline, itâs also aware that its reputation is in the spotlight. Earnings calls and shareholder letters over the first three quarters of 2024 indicate that the company knows it is a business imperative to make women feel safer on its platforms. Match Group brought in a new vice president to head trust and safety whose job partly focuses on complying with increased global transparency requirements. The company is experimenting with requiring faces in photos and rolled out a âShare My Dateâ feature so you can be tracked while meeting up with an online stranger. On Tinder, it orchestrated a âmajor ecosystem cleanupâ geared toward identifying fake profiles and getting scammers off the app. But neither the cleanup nor tracking a date from your phone would have stopped Matthews â a man who never sought to hide his identity, who assaulted his dates in his own home â from finding and harming women. Four years after Matthewsâ first documented assault, he walked into a wood-paneled courtroom in Denver and was sentenced to 158 years to life in prison. âI will sentence. I cannot heal,â Judge Eric Johnson told the room filled with survivors and family members. âCountless women have suffered and will continue to suffer,â said Laura Wolf, an attorney who represented the woman whose police report triggered Matthewsâ arrest. âHinge and other dating platforms have taken no steps to ensure the safety of the product they are selling, matching unsuspecting women to known predators without pause or concern.â Match Group didnât make it easy for the Denver prosecutors to convict Matthews. A search warrant was issued to Hinge in July 2023. Two months later, prosecutors were still empty-handed â with the judge in the case asking at a hearing if he needed to start âdragging people in to get stuff done.â It wasnât until February 2024 that the Denver District Attorneyâs Office said they finally received documents returned by Match Group. Matthews will likely never leave prison. Match Group executives currently face no charges. But the company knew about Matthews, and it knows about thousands of other abusive users. It has the data that could help users avoid dangerous situations, but it hasnât shared it, leaving millions of people in the dark. Lawmakers around the world are starting to ask for answers from the most powerful force in modern dating. In June, Colorado passed a law, triggered by the Matthews case, that forces dating app companies to tell the state attorney general what safety measures they are taking to protect users. Although the law leaves room for the possibility of additional transparency in the future, it does not currently require the company to tell the state, or the public, how many people are raped or assaulted after using its platform. In the U.S., weâve just scratched the surface. In most states, thereâs little that requires Match Group to share information with you â or with Congress. The reality is that if Stephen Matthews were released today, he could get right back on a dating app. Match Group knows this â and now so do you. Stephanie Wolf contributed reporting.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 15 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods.

Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies.

In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante explains how this market is beginning to re-shape automation for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 5 – Spending data shows that cloud native databases are disrupting traditional analytic data stores. Snowflake and AWS RedShift stand out as having spending momentum based on ETR survey data – Some cloud native databases have been architected to enable storage and compute resources to be scaled independently. This not only improves economics but also drives increased agility and flexibility for many use cases. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante explains how this dynamic is eating into traditional enterprise data warehouse markets. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 4 – Storage Spending Outlook 2H ’19 – Pure Leads the Pack – The on-prem storage business has been hurt by: 1) the cloud siphoning away demand; and 2) a massive injection of flash storage that has given data center managers enough performance headroom to minimize the need to buy for performance reasons.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 15 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 15 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave.

But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence.

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. Adobe (ADBE) released a beta version of its Firefly Video Model to the public this week — the market’s first commercially safe generative AI model for video, according to the company. The AI video model is available through Adobe’s new Firefly app and Premiere Pro with Generative Extend. The Firefly app integrates with Adobe’s other applications such as Photoshop and Express, so creators can use it for text-to-video generation, video storyboards, and more. “Firefly is designed for creative professionals looking for unmatched creative control and IP-friendly tools that can be used safely and effectively in both ideation and production,” David Wadhwani, president of Adobe’s digital media business, said in a statement. “We’ve been thrilled to hear from beta customers who’ve found it a game-changer for ideating concepts and producing stunning videos, and we can’t wait to see how the creative community uses it to bring their stories to the world.” Personal AI startup PIN AI launched a mobile app this week with a native large language model that allows users to protect their data. By having a personal data bank with PIN AI, users can have control over their data, while allowing AI developers access to insights on their behavior, such as their shopping and investing habits, to create personalized AI experiences across apps such as Gmail and social media platforms. “Unlike Big Tech monopolies that hoard data and suppress competition, PIN AI empowers users to protect and control their data,” PIN AI co-founder Bill Sun said. “It’s a revolutionary alternative to the exploitative practices of the current AI landscape represented by Big Tech and rising AI native monopolizers. We’re laying the groundwork for the agent economy where your Personal AI interacts with the external AI agent ecosystem interconnecting individual intent with a world of services.” Chip startup Positron announced a $23.5 million funding round this week for U.S.-made, energy-efficient chips that can be an alternative to Nvidia’s (NVDA). The round was backed by Flume Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Atreides Management, and Resilience Reserve. The startup is already shipping chips to data centers and neoclouds throughout the U.S. “With this funding, we’re scaling at a pace that AI hardware has never seen before–from expanding shipments of our first-generation products to bringing our second generation accelerators to market in 2026,” Mitesh Agrawal, CEO of Positron, said in a statement. “Our solution is growing rapidly because it outperforms conventional GPUs in both cost and energy efficiency, while delivering AI hardware that eliminates reliance on foreign supply chains.” AI video creator Synthesia launched Selfie Avatars this week as part of its AI avatar service. Users can create custom, talking avatars by uploading images of themselves. The Selfie Avatars are experimental, the company said, adding that it has done testing to prevent harmful content such as non-consensual deepfakes. “This feature marks an exciting milestone for Synthesia as we continue to innovate and shape the next generation of AI avatars coming later this year,” the company said in a statement. Chipmaker Groq announced this week that it secured a $1.5 billion commitment from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to expand its partnership and deliver advanced LPU-based AI inferencing infrastructure. In December, Groq built the largest inference cluster in the Middle East, and brought it online in eight days. Saudi Araba is working on its Vision 2030 goal of having an AI-powered economy. “It’s an honor for Groq to be supporting the Kingdom’s 2030 vision,” Jonathan Ross, CEO and founder of Groq, said in a statement. “We are excited to work alongside Saudi innovators to shape the next chapter of AI.”
