Both platforms cover financial and business news as well as sport and… More Info The City minister has reaffirmed the government’s ambition for a green transition across the financial services sector, despite the industry pivoting on climate priorities. Speaking at City Week on Monday, Emma Reynolds said: “The UK has a world leading financial and related professional services ecosystem and the research that is needed to integrate sustainable finance.” Reynolds said the Treasury’s upcoming Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy – a key pillar in the government’s economic agenda – will help foster the UK’s push to “transition finance” through honing in on skills as one of five key areas. But this comes amid a widespread retreat from the financial services sector. The banking industry has been at the forefront of a green row back, with Barclays and Natwest dropping climate targets from their annual bonus schemes for senior executives. Meanwhile, Europe’s biggest lender HSBC slapped a 20-year delay on its net zero target. Energy secretary Ed Miliband has touted plans to “transform” the UK’s financial services sector “into a global hub for green investment”. Whilst London is a leader in the area, City AM reported earlier this year green finance ratings across financial sectors were dramatically reducing. Despite topping the 15th edition of Z/Yen Global Green Finance Index, London’s rating reduced 36 points to 598. The Treasury has said the financial services growth strategy, set to be published on July 15, will “shape the type of growth being pursued, and support net zero, regional growth, and economic security and resilience”. Reynolds, who is steering the Treasury’s plans, said the upcoming COP30 in Brazil will be crucial to green ambitions following last years agreement where governments pledged to scale up climate finance into developing countries to $1.3 trillion per year by 2035. “We think that in order to make this a success, the road map must ensure that it’s based on several principles. It must be inclusive, it must have stability, and it must have focus,” the City minister added. But top names across the sector have vocalised concerns efforts in green finance have stalled. Sandra Boss, the UK Chair at Blackrock, said during a at City Week panel whilst “the need” for investing in renewable energy was “undeniable,” the energy transition was progressing “slower than hoped”. The waning commitment to green finance is being witnessed on a global scale and many have pointed to President Donald Trump’s return to the White House as a key catalyst. One of Trump’s first executive orders following his inauguration in both 2017 and 2025 was to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Agreement. The document encourages global co-operation to limit the causes of global warming. The World Bank – an international development organisation owned by 187 countries – softened its climate approach after the US took a chainsaw to climate programs.

June 30, 2025 13:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, June 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 21, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Why Jefferies Thinks Disney Stock Can Keep Climbing

Disney has set the stage for its stock to retouch levels last seen in 2022, Jefferies analysts said. Jefferies on Monday upgraded Disney (DIS) stock from “hold” to “buy," forecasting that its operating income will grow for the first time in nearly a decade. Favorable trends in theme park admission, cruise bookings and streaming subscriptions should contribute to the transition, analysts said. Disney shares were recently up less than 1%, trading for about $123. They’ve gained nearly 11% so far this year, steadily rising since mid-April, when the White House softened its approach to tariffs. Their climb may only be beginning, Jefferies said: It raised its price target for Disney shares to $144—the third highest target shared by analysts who follow Disney and are tracked by Visible Alpha, where the average target is around $131. “Since 2016, [Disney] has juggled several factors … leading to limited [operating income] growth and limited stock appreciation,” Jefferies wrote in a note that credited CEO Bob Iger with improving the company’s outlook. “However, we believe Iger and co. have finally righted the ship, and the drivers ahead can change this dynamic.” Disney plans to add two cruise ships to its fleet in early 2025, which could bolster revenue by about $1 billion to $1.5 billion, according to Jefferies’ estimates. Travel and tourism spending is holding up better than anticipated, which should help Disney’s theme parks, analysts added. The outlook for Disney’s streaming services is also bright, analysts said. Analysts estimate Disney+ can add 5 million subscribers annually over the next few years and boost advertising revenue thanks, in part, to an Amazon (AMZN) partnership that allows for more targeted ads.

(NASDAQ: MANH): Grabar Law Office is investigating whether certain officers and directors of Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ: MANH) breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company. If you have held Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ: MANH) shares since prior to October 22, 2024, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/manh-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. Why? A recently filed securities fraud class action complaint alleges that Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ: MANH), through certain of its officers, provided investors with material information concerning Manhattan Associates’ expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. These statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services. The underlying complaint alleges that Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Manhattan Associates’ forecasting ability for its professional services; notably, the Company was either not truly equipped to deliver “responsible targets” for growth or, otherwise, Manhattan Associates’ services were not equipped to achieve such targets. Finally, the Complaint alleges that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Manhattan Associates’ securities at artificially inflated prices. What You Can Do Now: Current Manhattan Associates shareholders who have held Manhattan Associates shares since prior to October 22, 2024, are encourage to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/manh-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H.

Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H.

(NYSE: VIRT) Class Action Survives Motion to Dismiss: A federal securities fraud class action complaint alleging that Virtu Financial Inc. (NYSE: VIRT), and certain of its officers failed to disclose to investors that it had improper safeguards in place for sensitive trader information, has survived a motion to dismiss. Virtu shareholders who have continuously held Virtu shares since prior to November 7, 2018, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever. Learn more or join by clicking https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Virtu-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. WHY: A securities fraud class action complaint alleges that Virtu Financial (NASDAQ: VIRT), via certain of its officers, made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the Company maintained deficient policies and procedures with respect to its information access barriers; (ii) accordingly, Virtu had overstated the Company’s operational and technological efficacy as well as its capacity to block the exchange of confidential information between departments or individuals within the Company; (iii) the foregoing deficiencies increased the likelihood that the Company would be subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. On March 17, 2025, a federal Court determined that key allegations were sufficiently pled to survive defendants’ motion to dismiss. According to the Court’s Order, "essentially anyone at Virtu, including its proprietary traders" could directly access this material non-public information from at least January 2018 through April 2019, and to do so, Virtu traders only needed to use a "widely known and frequently shared username and password." WHAT YOU SHOULD DO NOW: If you are a current Virtu shareholder who has held Virtu stock since on or before November 7, 2018, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds spent defending litigation back to the company, and a court approved incentive award, at no cost to you whatsoever.

Title: ETF Expert Says Ripple Closing This Chapter Clears The Way For XRP ETF, BlackRock To Join The Race?

Nate Geraci, the president of the ETF store, has weighed in on what Ripple’s decision to drop its cross appeal could mean for XRP ETFs. He also raised the possibility of BlackRock joining the ETF race now that the lawsuit is ending. In an X post, Nate Geraci stated that a closed chapter on the XRP lawsuit clears the way for a spot XRP ETF. His statement suggested that the SEC could now move to approve the applications for issuers to offer this fund. Geraci was reacting to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s announcement of his firm’s decision to drop its cross-appeal against the SEC. Bitcoinist reported that Garlinghouse stated that Ripple is dropping its cross-appeal and that the SEC is expected to drop its appeal, which will put an end to the XRP lawsuit. He added that they are closing this chapter and focusing on building the Internet of Value. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart had earlier in the year mentioned how the lawsuit impacts an XRP ETF. In an X post, Seyffart opined back then that there is unlikely to be an XRP ETF until the whole XRP lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple is settled. He added that the Commission needed to “untangle that mess” before it possibly proceeds to approve these ETFs. Indeed, the SEC has, up till now, continued to delay its decision on these funds and has yet to provide comments. This is unlike the Solana ETFs, which the Commission had asked issuers to amend, as it prepares to approve these funds. However, once the SEC drops its appeal and formally ends the XRP lawsuit, this could change, with the Commission communicating with XRP ETF issuers on the next steps. Nate Geraci also stated that the end of the XRP lawsuit also clears the way for the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, to file to offer an XRP ETF. Despite already offering Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the asset manager has yet to file for other crypto ETFs, including one for XRP. This is unlike other Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF issuers, such as Bitwise, which has filed to offer ETFs for XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin, among others. However, as Geraci predicts, that could change soon enough, with BlackRock filing for an XRP ETF. The asset manager would be the eighth to do so if they file for this fund anytime soon. Bloomberg analysts Seyffart and Eric Blachunas predict a 95% chance that the SEC will approve these funds this year. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.19, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Have you ever heard Sam Altman speak? I’m serious, have you ever heard this man say words from his mouth? Here is but one of the trenchant insights from Sam Altman in his agonizing 37-minute-long podcast conversation with his brother Jack Altman from last week: When asked why he believes AI will “discover new science,” Altman says that “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” adding that “we’ve a long way to go,” and that he “think[s] we know what to do,” adding that OpenAI’s o3 model “is already pretty smart,” and that he’s heard people say “wow, this is like a good PHD.” That’s the entire answer! It’s complete nonsense! Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, a company allegedly worth $300 billion to venture capitalists and SoftBank, kind of sounds like a huge idiot! “But Ed!” you cry. “You can’t just call Sam Altman an idiot! He isn’t stupid! He runs a big company, and he’s super successful!” My counter to that is, first, yes I can, I’m doing it right now. Second, if Altman didn’t want to be called stupid, he wouldn’t say stupid shit with a straight face to a massive global audience. My favourite part of the interview is near the beginning: This is a nonsensical conversation, and both of them sound very, very stupid. “So, is this going to make new science or make science faster?” “Yeah, I hear scientists are using AI to go faster [CITATION NEEDED], but if a human scientist goes three times faster [CITATION NEEDED] using my model that would be good. Also I heard from a guy that he heard a guy who did biology who said ‘this helped.’” Phenomenal! Give this guy $40 billion or more dollars every year until he creates a superintelligence, that’ll fucking work. Here are some other incredible quotes from the genius mind of Sam Altman: This is gobbledygook, nonsense, bullshit peddled by a guy who has only the most tangential understanding of the technology his company is building. Every single interview with Sam Altman is like this, every single one, ever since he became a prominent tech investor and founder. Without fail. And the sad part is that Altman isn’t alone in this. Sundar Pichai, when asked one of Nilay Patel’s patented 100-word-plus-questions about Jony Ive and Sam Altman’s new (and likely heavily delayed) hardware startup: The fuck are you on about, Sundar? Your answer to a question about whether you anticipate more competition is to say “yeah I think people are gonna make shit we haven’t come up with and uhh, hardware, can’t wait!” While I think Pichai is likely a little smarter than Altman, in the same way that Satya Nadella is a little smarter than Pichai, and in the same way that a golden retriever is smarter than a chihuahua. That said, none of these men are superintelligences, nor, when pressed, do they ever seem to have any actual answers. Let’s see what Satya Nadella of Microsoft answered when asked about how exactly it’s going to get to (and I paraphrase Dwarkesh Patel’s mealy-mouthed question) $130 billion in AI revenue “through AGI”: This quote has been used as a means of suggesting that Nadella is saying that “generative AI is generating basically no value,” which, while somewhat true, obfuscates its true meaning: Satya Nadella isn’t saying a fucking thing. The question was “how do you get Microsoft to $130 billion in revenue,” and Satya Nadella’s answer was to say “uhhh, abundance, uhhh, explosion, uhhhhh, GDP! Growth! Industrial revolution! Inflation-adjusted! Percentages! The winners will be the people who do stuff, and then productivity will go up!” This is fucking nonsense, and it’s time to stop idolizing these speciously-informed goobers. While kinder souls or Zitron-haters may read this and say “ahh, actually, what Nadella was saying was…” stop. I want to stop you there and suggest that perhaps a smart person should be able to speak clearly enough that their intent is obvious. It’s tempting to believe that there is some sort of intellectual barrier between you and the powerful — that the confusing and obtuse way that they speak is the sound of genius, rather than somebody who has learned a lot of smart-sounding words without ever learning what they mean. “But Ed, they’re trained to do this!” As someone who has media trained hundreds of people, there is only so much you can do to steer someone’s language. You cannot say to Sundar Pichai “hey man, can you sound more confusing?” You can, however, tell them what not to talk about and hope for the best. Sure, you can make them practice, sure, you can give them feedback, but people past a certain stage of power or popularity are going to talk however they want, and if they’re a big stupid idiot pretending to be smart, they’re going to sound exactly like this. Why? Because nobody in the media ever asks them to explain themselves. When you’ve spent your entire career being asked friendly-or-friendly-adjacent questions and never having someone say “wait, what does that mean?” you will continue to mutate in a pseudo-communicator that spits out information-adjacent bullshit. I am, to be clear, being very specific about that question. Powerful CEOs and founders never, ever get asked to explain what they’re saying, even when what they’re saying barely resembles an actual answer. Pichai, Altman and Nadella have always given this kind of empty-brained intellectual slop in response to questions because the media coddles them. These people are product managers and/or management consultants — and in Altman’s case, a savvy negotiator and manipulator known for “an absenteeism that rankled his peers and some of the startups he was supposed to nurture” as an investor at yCombinator, according to the Washington Post. By “coddle,” I mean these people are deliberately engaging in a combination of detective work and amnesia, where the reader or the listener is forced to simultaneously try and divine the meaning of their answer, while also not thinking too hard about the question the interviewer asked. Look at most modern business interviews. They involve a journalist asking a question, somebody giving an answer, and the journalist saying “okay!” and moving onto the next question, occasionally saying “but what about this?” when the appropriate response to many of the answers is to ask them to simplify them so that their meaning is clearer. A common response to all of this is to say that “interviewers can’t be antagonistic,” and I don’t think a lot of people understand what that means. It isn’t “antagonistic” to ask somebody to clearly articulate what they’re saying, nor is it “antagonistic” to say that you don’t understand, or that they didn’t answer the question you asked. If this is “antagonistic” to you, you are, intellectually-speaking, a giant fucking coward, because what you’re suggesting is that somebody cannot ask somebody to explain themselves, which is what an interview is. And I imagine nobody really wants to do this, because if you actually put these people on the spot, you’d realize the dark truth that I spoke of a few weeks ago: that the reason the powerful sound like idiots is because, well, they’re idiots. They sound like Business Idiots and create products to sell to Business Idiots, because Business Idiots run most companies and buy solutions based on what the last Business Idiot told them. To quote the excellent Nik Suresh: I know some of you might read this and say “these people can’t be stupid! These people run companies! They make huge deals! They read all these books!” and my answer is that some of the stupidest people I’ve ever met have read more books than you or I will read in a lifetime. While they might be smart when it comes to corporate chess moves or saying “this product category should do this,” none of these men — not Altman, Pichai or Nadella — actually has a hand in the design or creation of any of the things their companies make, and they never, ever have. Regardless, I have a larger point: it’s time to start mocking these people and tearing down their legends as geniuses of industry. They are not better than us, nor are they responsible for anything that their companies build other than the share price (which is a meaningless figure) and the accumulation of power and resources. These men are neither smart nor intellectually superior, and it’s time to start treating them as such. These people are powerful because they have names that are protected by the press. They are powerful because it is seen as unseemly to mock them because they are rich and “running a company,” a kind of corporate fealty that I find deeply unbecoming of an adult. We are, at most, customers. We do not “owe them” anything. We are long past the point when any of the people running these companies actually invented anything they sell. iIf anything, they owe us something, because they are selling us a product, even if said product is free and monetised by advertising. While reporters — as anyone — should have some degree of professionalism in interviews or covering subjects, there is no reason to treat these people as special, even if they have managed to raise a lot of money or their product is popular, because if that were the case we’d have far more coverage of defense contractor Lockheed Martin. It made $1.71 billion in profit last quarter, and hasn’t had a single quarter under a billion dollars in the last year. I’m being a little glib, but the logic behind covering OpenAI is, at this point, “it makes a lot of money and its product is popular,” which is also a fitting description of Lockheed Martin. The difference is that OpenAI has a consumer product that loses billions of dollars, and Lockheed Martin has products that makes billions of dollars by removing consumers from the Earth. Both of them are environmentally destructive. Covering OpenAI sure doesn’t seem to be about the tech, because if you looked at the tech you’d have to understand the tech, you’d see that the user numbers weren’t there outside of the 500 million people using ChatGPT, of which very few are actually paying for the product, and that the term “user” encompasses everything from the most occasional users who log in out of curiosity, to people who are actually using it as part of their daily lives. If covering OpenAI was about the tech, you’d read about how the tech itself doesn’t seem to have a ton of mass-market use cases, and those use cases aren’t really the kind of things that you’d pay for. If they did, there’d be articles that definitively discussed them versus articles in the New York Times about “everybody using AI” that boil down to “I use ChatGPT as search now” and “I heard a guy who asked it to teach him about modern art.” Yet men like Dario Amodei and Sam Altman continue to be elevated because they are “building the future,” even if they don’t seem to have built it yet, or have the ability to clearly articulate what that future actually looks like. Anthropic has now put out multiple stories suggesting that its generative AI will “blackmail” people as a means of stopping a user from turning off the system, something which is so obviously the company prompting its models to do so. Every member of the media covering this uncritically should feel ashamed of themselves. Sadly, this is all a result of the halo effect of being a Guy Who Raised Money or Guy Who Runs Big Company. We must, as human beings, assume that these people are smart, and that they’d never mislead us, because if we accept that they aren’t smart and that they willingly mislead us, we’d have to accept that the powerful are, well, bad and possibly unremarkable. And if they’re untrustworthy people that don’t seem that smart, we have to accept that the world is deeply unfair, and caters to people like them far more than it caters to people like us. We do not owe Satya Nadella any respect because he’s the CEO of Microsoft. If anything, we should show him outright scorn for the state of Microsoft products. Microsoft Teams is an insulting mess that only sometimes works, leaving workers spending 57% of their time either in Teams Chat, Teams Meetings or sending emails according to a Microsoft study. MSN.com is an abomination read by hundreds of millions of people a month, bloated with intrusive advertisements, attempts to trick you into downloading an app, and quasi-content that may or may not be AI generated. There are few products on the modern internet that show more contempt for the user -- other than, of course, Skype, a product that Microsoft let languish for more than a decade, the product so thoroughly engorged with spam that leaving it unattended for more than a month left you with a hundred unread messages from Eastern European romance scammers. Microsoft finally killed it in May. Products like Word and Excel don’t need improving, but that doesn’t stop Microsoft from trying, bloating them with odd user interface choices and forcing users to fight with popups to use an AI-powered Copilot that most of them hate. Why, exactly, are we meant to show these people respect? Because they run a company that provides a continually-disintegrating service? Because that service has such a powerful monopoly that it’s difficult to leave it if you’re interacting with other people or businesses? I think it’s because we live in Hell. The modern tech ecosystem is so utterly vile. Every single day our tech breaks in new and inventive ways, our iPhones resetting at random, random apps not accepting button presses, our Bluetooth disconnecting, our word processors harassing us to “try and use AI” while no longer offering us suggestions for typos, and our useful products replaced with useless shit, like how Google’s previously-functional assistants were replaced with generative AI that makes them tangibly worse so that Google can claim it has 350 million monthly active Gemini users. Yet the tech and business media acts as if everything is fine. It isn’t fine! It’s all really fucked! You can call me a cynic or a pessimist or every name under the sun, but the stakes have never been higher, and the damage never more wide-spread. Everything feels broken, and covering these companies as if it isn’t is insulting to your readers and your own intelligence. Look at the state of your computer or phone and tell me anything feels congruent or intentional rather than an endless battle of incentives. Look at the notifications on your phone and count the number of them that have absolutely nothing to do with information you actively need. As we speak, I have a notification from Adobe Lightroom, an app I use occasionally to edit photos, that tells me “Elevate any scene - now enhance people, sky, water and more with Quick Actions.” Zerocam, an app that brands itself “the first anti-AI camera app” where you “capture moments, not megapixels,” gave me a notification asking if I took a photo today. Amazon notified me that there is a deal picked just for me — a battery pack that I bought several months ago. Every single company that sends notifications like these should be mocked, but we have accepted such vile conditions as the norm. Apple should be tarred and feathered for allowing companies to send spam notifications, and yet it isn’t because, by and large, Apple is less vile and less exploitative than Microsoft, Google or Amazon. If you are reading this as a member of the tech press, seriously, please look at your daily experience with tech. Count the number of times that your day or a task is interrupted by poorly-designed software or hardware (such as the many, many times Zoom or Teams has a problem with Bluetooth, or a website just doesn’t load, or you type something into your browser and it just doesn’t do anything), or when the software you use either actively impedes you (hey, did you want to use AI? No? You sure?) or refuses to work in a logical way (see: Google Drive). There are tens of thousands of stories like this every day, and if you talked to people, you’d see how widespread it is…or maybe, I dunno, see that it’s happening to you too? There are people responsible, and the tech media writes about them every day. I realize it seems weird to constantly write that a company is releasing broken, convoluted software, but hey, if we can write 300,000 stories about how crime-ridden New York City is, why can’t we write three of them about how fucked Microsoft Office or Google Search have become? And why can’t we talk to the people in power about it? Is it because the questions are too hard to ask? Is it because it feels icky to interrupt Satya Nadella as he waffles on about using Copilot all the time by saying “hey man, Microsoft Teams is broken, tons of people feel this way, why?” or “why have you let MSN.com turn into a hub of AI slop and outright disinformation?” Oh no! You won’t get your access! Wahh! Who cares? Write a story about how Microsoft has become so unbelievably profitable as its products get worse, and talk about how weird and bad that is for the world! Ask Nadella those tough questions, or publish that Microsoft’s PR wouldn’t let you! These people are neither articulate nor wise, and whatever “intelligence” they may claim to have doesn’t seem to manifest in good products or intelligent statements. So why treat them like they’re smart? Why show them deference or pleasantries? These people have crapped up our digital lives at scale, and they deserve contempt, or at the very least a stern fucking reception. I realize I’m repeating points I’ve made again and again, but why is there such a halo around these fucking bozos? I’m serious! Why are we so protective of these guys? We’re more than happy to criticise celebrities, musicians, professional sports players, and politicians (fucking barely), but the business class is somehow protected outside of the occasional willingness to say that Elon Musk might have sort have done something wrong. I’m not denying there are critics. We have Molly White, Edward Ongweso Jr, Brian Merchant and — at a major outlet like CNN, no less! — one of the greatest living business writers in Allison Morrow. I believe that tech criticism is a barely-explored and hugely-profitable industry if we treated tech journalism less like the society pages and more like a force to hold the most powerful people in the world accountable as they continually harm billions of people in subtle ways. People are angry, and they aren’t stupid, and they want to see that anger reflected in the stories they read — and the meek deference we show to dumb fucking tech leaders is the opposite of that. As I’ve said before: we live in an era of digital tinnitus, nagged by notifications, warring with software ostensibly built for us that acts as if we’re the enemy. And if we’re the enemy, we should treat those building this software as the enemy in return. We are their customers, and they have failed us. The entire approach to business owners, especially in tech, is ridiculous. These people are selling us a product and the product fucking stinks! Put aside however you feel about generative AI for a second and face one very simple point: it doesn’t do enough, it’s really not cool at all, and we’re being forced to use it. I realize that some of you may want them to succeed, or want to be the person who tells everybody that they did so. I get that there are rewards for you — promotions, new positions, TV appearances repeating exactly what the powerful did and why they did it, or a plush role as that company’s head of communications — but I am telling you, your readers and viewers are waking up to it, and they feel like you have contempt for them and contempt for the truth. It’s easy — and common! — to try and dismiss my work as some sort of hater’s screed, a “cynical” approach to a tech industry that’s trying “brave new things” or whatever. In my opinion, there’s nothing more cynical than watching billions of people get shipped increasingly-shitty and expensive solutions and then get defensive of the people shipping them, and hostile to the people who are complaining that the products they use suck. I am angry at these companies because they have, at scale, torn down a tech industry that allowed me to be who I am today, and their intentional and disgraceful moves fill me full of disgust. I have watched the tech media move away from covering “technology” and more toward covering the people behind it, to the point that the actual outputs — the software and hardware we use every day — have taken a backseat to stories about whether Elon Musk does or doesn’t use a computer, which is meaningless, empty gossip journalism built to be shared by peers and nothing else. And please, please do not talk about optimism. If you are blindly saying that everything OpenAI does is cool and awesome and interesting, you aren’t being optimistic — you’re telling other people to be optimistic about a company’s success. It isn’t “optimistic” to believe that a company is going to build powerful AI despite it failing to do so. It’s propaganda, and yes, this is also the case if you simply don’t do the research to form a real opinion. I am not a pessimist because I criticize these companies, and framing me as one is cowardly and ignorant. If you are so weak-willed and speciously-informed that you can’t see somebody criticise a company without outright dismissing them as “a hater” or “pessimist,” you are an insult to journalism or analysis, and you know it in your wretched little heart. My heart sings with a firm belief in the things I think, founded on rigorous structures of knowledge that I’ve gained from reading things and talking to people, because something in me is incapable of being swayed by something just because everybody else is. You are assuming people are right because it is inconvenient and uncomfortable to accept they may not be, because doing so requires you to reckon with a market-wide hysteria founded on desperation and a lack of hyper-growth markets left in the tech industry. Worse still, in engaging with faux-optimism, you are failing to protect your readers and the general public. And if that’s what you want to do, ask yourself why! Why do you want these companies to win? What is it you want them to win? Do you want them to be rich? Do you want to be the person that told people they would be first? What is the world you want, and what does it look like, and how does doing your job in this way work toward creating that world? This isn’t optimism — it’s horse-trading, or strategic alignment behind powerful entities. It is choosing a side, because your side isn’t with the reader or the truth. If it was — even if you believed generative AI was powerful and that they simply didn’t understand — your duty would be to educate the reader in a clear-set and obvious way, and if you can’t find a way to do so, acknowledging that and explaining why. True optimism requires you to have a deep, meaningful understanding of things so that you can engage in real hope — a magical feeling, one that can buoy you in the most challenging times. What many claim is “optimism” is actually blind faith, the likes of which you’ll see at a roulette table. Or, of course, knowingly peddling propaganda. Let’s even take a different tact: say you actually want these companies to “build powerful AI,” and believe they’re smart enough to do so. Say that, somehow, looking at their decaying finances, the lack of revenue, the lack of growth, and the remarkable lack of use cases, you still come out of it saying “sure, I think they’re going to do this!” How? Why haven’t they done it yet? Why, three years in, are we still unable to describe what ChatGPT actually does, and why we need it? Take away how much money OpenAI makes for a second (and, indeed, how much it loses). Does this product actually really inspire anything in you? What is it that’s magical about this? And, on a business level, what is it I’m meant to be impressed by, exactly? OpenAI has — allegedly — hit “$10 billion in annualized revenue” (essentially the biggest month it can find, multiplied by 12), which is…not that much, really, considering it’s the most prominent company in the software world, with the biggest brand, and with the attention of the entirety of the world’s media. It has, allegedly, 500 million weekly active users — and, by the last count, only 15.5 million paying subscribers, an absolutely putrid conversion rate even before you realize that the actual conversion rate would be monthly active subscribers. That’s how any real software company actually defines its metrics, by the fucking way. Why is this impressive? Because it grew fast? It literally had more PR and more marketing and more attention and more opportunities to sell to more people than any company has ever had in the history of anything. Every single industry has been told to think about AI for three years, and they’ve been told to do so because of a company called OpenAI. There isn’t a single god damn product since Google or Facebook that has had this level of media pressure, and both of those companies launched without the massive amount of media (and social media) that we have today. Having literally everybody talking about your product all the time for years is pretty useful! Why isn’t it making more money? Why are we taking any of these people seriously? Mark Zuckerberg paid $14.3 billion for Scale AI, an AI data company, as a means of hiring its CEO Alexandr Wang to run his “superintelligence” team, has been offering random OpenAI employees $100 million to join Meta, thought about buying both AI search company Perplexity and generative video company Runway and even tried to buy OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever’s pre-product “$32bn valuation” non-company Safe Superintelligence, settling instead on hiring its CEO Daniel Gross and buying his venture fund for some fucking reason. When you put aside the big numbers, these are the actions of a desperate dimwit with a failing product trying to buy his way to making generative AI into a “superintelligence,” something that Meta’s own Chief AI scientist Yan LeCun says isn’t going to work. By assuming that there is some sort of grand strategy behind these moves beyond “if we get enough smart people together something will happen,” you help boost the powerful’s messaging and buoy their stock valuations. You are not educating anybody by humouring these goofballs. In fact, the right way to approach this would be to ask why Meta, a multi-trillion dollar market cap company with a near-monopoly over all social media, is spending billions of dollars in what appears to be a totally irresponsible way. Instead, people are suggesting this is Mark Zuckerberg’s genius at work. Anyway, putting that aside, what exactly is the impressive part of generative AI again? The fucking code? Enough about the code, I’m tired of hearing about the code, I swear to god you people think that being a software engineer is only coding and that it’s fine if you ship “mediocre code,” as if bad code can’t bring down entire organizations. What do you think a software engineer does? Is all they do code? If you think the answer is yes, you are wrong! Human beings may make mistakes in writing code, but they at least know what a mistake looks like, which a generative AI does not, because a generative AI doesn’t know what anything is, or anything at all, because it is a probabilistic model. Congratulations! You made another way in which software engineers can automate parts of their jobs — stop being so fucking excited about the idea that people are going to lose their livelihoods! It’s nasty, and founded on absolutely nothing other than your adulation for the powerful! These models are dangerous and chaotic, built with little intention or regard for the future, just like the rest of big tech’s products. ChatGPT would’ve been a much smaller deal if Google had any interest in turning Google Search into a product that truly answered a query (as opposed to generating more of them to show more impressions to advertisers) — a nuanced search engine that took a user’s query and spat out a series of websites that might help answer said question rather than just summarising a few of them for an answer. And if you ever need proof that Google just doesn’t know how to fucking innovate anymore, look at AI Summaries, a product that both misunderstands search and why people use ChatGPT as a search replacement. While OpenAI may “summarise” stuff to give an answer, it at the very least gives something approximating a true answer, rather than a summary that feels like an absentee parent trying to get rid of you and then throwing you $20 in the hopes you’ll leave them alone. If Google Search truly evolved, ChatGPT wouldn’t really matter, because the idea of a machine that can theoretically answer a question is kind of why people used fucking Google in the fucking first place. Again, why are we not describing this company as the business equivalent of a banana republic? It’s actively making its shit worse to juice growth, and it’s really obvious how badly it sucks. Why doesn’t the state of Google dominate tech news, just like how random ketamine-fuelled tweets from Elon Musk do? Why aren’t we, collectively, repulsed by Google as a company? Why aren’t we, collectively, repulsed by OpenAI? No matter how big ChatGPT is, the fact that there’s a product out there with hundreds of millions of users that constantly gets answers wrong is a genuinely worrying thing for society, and that’s before you get to the environmental damage, the fact it trained its models on millions of people’s art and writing, and oh, I dunno, the fact it plans to lose over a hundred billions of dollars before becoming profitable? Why are we not more horrified? Why are we not more forlorn that this is where hundreds of billions of dollars are being forced? The most prominent company in the tech industry is an unstable monolith with a vague product that can only make $10 billion a year (revenue, not profit) as the very fabric of its existence is shoved down the throat of every executive in the world at once. Also, if it’s not fed $20 billion to $40 billion a year, it will die. Give me a fucking break. I don’t know, I sound pretty ornery, I get accused of being a hater or missing the grand mystery of this bullshit every few minutes by somebody with an AI avatar of a guy who looks like he’s banned from multiple branches of Best Buy, I understand there’s things that people do with Large Language Models, I am aware, but none of it matters because the way they’re being discussed is like we’re two steps from digitally replacing hundreds of millions of people. The reality is far simpler: we have an industry that has spent nearly half a trillion dollars between its capital expenditures and venture capital funding to create another industry with the combined revenue of the fucking smartwatch industry. What I’m writing isn’t inflammatory — in fact, it’s far more deeply rooted in reality than those claiming that OpenAI is building the future. Let’s do some fucking mathematics! Projected Big Tech Capital Expenditures in 2025 and revenue from AI: That’s $327 billion this year, with a total revenue of…what, $18 billion of revenue? And that’s not profit! And that’s if we include OpenAI’s spend on Azure. Even if every single one of these companies was making $18 billion in revenue a year from this it wouldn’t be great, but it’s more than likely that these chunderfucks can’t even pull together the projected revenue ($32 billion) of the global smartwatch industry! What a joke! “Wuhh, but what about OpenAI?” What about OpenAI? I’ve written about this so much. So what, OpenAI makes $12.7 billion this year, but loses $14 billion, what does that mean to you, exactly? What’re you going to say? The cost of inference is coming down? No, the cost that people are being charged is going down, we have no firm data on the actual costs because the companies don’t want to talk about it, and yes, it will absolutely lower prices to compete with other companies. The Information just reported that OpenAI was doing this to compete with Microsoft last week! Hey, quick question — wasn’t SoftBank meant to spend $3 billion annually on OpenAI’s software? Did that happen? Anyway, even if we add OpenAI’s revenue to the pot, we are at $30.7 billion. If we add the supposed $1 billion in revenue from training data startup Surge, $300 million in “annualized revenue” from Turing, optimistically assume that Perplexity will have $100 million (up from $34 million in 2024, where it burned $65 million) in revenue in 2025, and assume that Anysphere’s (which makes Cursor) $200 million run rate stays consistent through 2025, we are at…$32.3 billion. But I'm not being fair, am I? I didn’t include many of the names from The Information’s generative AI database. Prepare yourself, this is gonna be annoying! So let's add some more. We’ve got $3 billion from Anthropic, $870 million from Scale (now part of Meta), another alleged $300 million for Anysphere (The Information claims $500 million in ARR), we consider Neo4j’s “>$200 million ARR” to mean “$200 million,” Midjourney’s “>$200 million ARR” to mean $200m, Ironclad’s “>$150 million ARR” to mean $150 million ARR, Glean’s $103 million ARR, Together AI’s $100 million ARR, Moveworks’ $100 million ARR, Abridge’s $100 million ARR, Synthesia’s $100 million ARR, WEKA’s “>$100 million ARR” to mean $100m ARR, Windsurf’s $100m ARR, Runway’s $84 million ARR, Elevenlabs’ “>$100m ARR” to mean $100m ARR, Cohere’s $70m ARR, Jasper’s “>$60m ARR” to mean $60m, Harvey’s $50m ARR, Ada’s “>$50m ARR” to mean $50m, Photoroom’s $50m ARR…and then assumed the combined ARR of the remainders are somewhere in the region of a very generous $200m, we get… Less than $39 billion dollars of total revenue in the entire generative AI industry. Jesus fucking christ! According to The Information, generative AI companies have raised more than $18.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025, after investing $21 billion in Q4 2024 and $4 billion in Q3 2024 for a grand total of $43.8 billion, or a total of $370.8 billion of investment and capital expenditures for an industry that, despite being the single-most talked about thing on the planet, cannot even create a tenth of the dollars it requires to make it work. These companies are predominantly unprofitable, perpetually searching for product-market fit, and even when they find it, seem incapable of generating revenue numbers that remotely justify their valuations. If I’m honest, I think the truly radical position here is the one taken by most tech reporters that would rather take the lazy position of “well Uber lost a lot of money!” than think for two seconds about whether we’re all being sold a line of shit. What we’re watching is a mountain of waste perpetuated by the least-charming failsons of our generation. Nobody should be giving Satya Nadella or Sam Altman a glossy profile — they should be asking direct, brutal questions, much like Joanna Stern just did of Apple’s Craig Federighi, who had absolutely fucking nothing to share because he has never been pushed like this. Put aside the money for a second and be honest: these men are pathetic, unimpressive, uninventive, and dreadfully, dreadfully boring. Anthropic’s Wario (Sorry, Dario) Amodei and OpenAI’s Sam Altman have far more in common with televangelist Joel Olstein than they’ll ever have with Steve Jobs or any number of people that have actually invented things, and they got that way because we took them seriously instead of saying “wait, what do you mean?” To a single one of their wrongheaded, oafish and dim-witted hype-burps. It’s boring! I’m terribly, horribly bored, and if you’re interested in this shit I am genuinely curious why, especially if you’re a reporter, because right now the “innovation” happening in AI is, at best, further mutations of the Software As A Service business model, providing far less value than previous innovations at a calamitous cost. Reasoning models don’t even reason, as proven by an Apple paper released a few weeks ago, and agents as a concept are fucked because large language models are inherently unreliable — and yes, a study out of fucking Salesforce found that agents began to break down when given multi-step tasks, such as “any task you’d want to have an agent automate.” So, here’s my radical suggestion: start making fun of these people. They are not charming. They are not building anything. They have scooted along amassing billions of dollars promising the world and delivering you a hill of dirt. They deserve our derision — or, at the very least, our deep, unerring suspicion, if not for what they’ve done, but for what they’ve not done. Sam Altman is nowhere near delivering a functioning agent, let alone anything approaching intelligence, and really only has one skill: making other companies risk a bunch of money on his stupid ideas. No, really! He convinced Oracle to buy $40 billion of NVIDIA chips to put in the Abilene Texas “Stargate” data center, despite the fact that the Stargate organization has yet to be formed (as reported by The Information). SoftBank and Microsoft pay all of OpenAI’s bills, and the media does his marketing for him. OpenAI is, as I said, quite literally a banana republic. It requires the media and the markets to make up why it has to exist, it requires other companies to pump it full of money and build its infrastructure, and it doesn’t even make products that matter, with Sam Altman constantly talking about all the exciting shit other people will build. You can keep honking about how “it built the API that will power the future,” but if that’s the case, where’s the fucking future, exactly? Where is it? What am I looking at here? Where’s the economic activity? Where’s the productivity? The returns suck! The costs are too high! Why am I the radical person for saying this? This entire situation is absolutely god damn ridiculous, an incomparable waste even if it somehow went in the green. For the horrendous amounts of capital invested in generative AI to make sense, the industry would have to have revenue that dwarfed the smartphone and enterprise SaaS market combined, rather than less than half of that of the mobile gaming industry. Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Wario Amodei, Tim Cook, Andy Jassy — they deserve to be laughed at, mocked, or at the very least interrogated vigorously, because their combined might has produced no exciting or interesting products outside of, at best, what will amount to a productivity upgrade for integrated development environments and faster ways to throw out code that may or may not be reliable. These things aren’t nothing, but they’re nowhere near the something that we’re being promised. So I put it to you, dear reader: why are we taking them seriously? What is there to take seriously other than their ability to force stuff on people? And I’ll leave you with a question: how do they manage to keep doing this, exactly? They always seem to find new growth, every single quarter, without fail? Is it because they keep coming up with new ideas? Or is it because they come up with new ideas to get more money, a vastly different choice that involves increasing the prices of products or making them worse so that they can show you more advertisements. My positions are not radical, and if you believe they are, your deference to the powerful disgusts me. In any case, I want to end this with something inspirational, because I believe that things change when regular people feel stronger and more capable. I want you to know that you are fully capable of understanding all of this. I don’t care if you “aren’t a numbers person” or “don’t get business.’ I don’t have a single iota of economics training, and everything you’ve ever read me write has been something I’ve had to learn. I was a layperson right up until I learned the stuff, then I became a stuff-knower, just like you can be. The tech industry, the finance industry, the entire mechanisms of capitalism want you to believe that everything they do is magical and complex, when it’s all far more obvious than you’d believe. You don’t have to understand the entire fundamentals of finance to know how venture capital works — they buy percentages of companies at a valuation that they hope is much lower than the company would be worth in the future. You don’t need to be technical to know that Large Language Models generate a response based on billions of pieces of training data, and by guessing at what the next bit of text in a line should be based on what it’s seen previously. These people love to say “ah, but didn’t you see-” and present an anecdote, when no anecdote will ever defeat the basics of “your business doesn’t make any money, the software doesn’t do the things you claim it’s meant to, and you have no path to profitability.” They can yammer at you all they want about “lots of people using ChatGPT,” but that doesn’t change the fact that ChatGPT just isn’t that revolutionary, and their only play here is to make you feel stupid rather than actually showing you why it’s so fucking revolutionary. This is the argument of a manipulator and a coward, and you are above such things. You don’t really have to be a specialist in anything to pry this shit apart, which is why so much of my work is either engaging to those who learn something from it or frustrating to those that intentionally deceive others through gobbledygook hype-schpiel. I will sit here and explain every fucking part of this horrid chain of freaks, and break it down into whatever pieces it takes to educate as many people as I have to to make things change. I also must be clear that I am nobody. I started writing this newsletter with 300 subscribers and no reason other than the fact I wanted to, and four years later I have nearly 64,000 subscribers and an award-winning podcast. I have no economics training, no special access, no deep sources, just the ability to look at things that are happening and say stuff. I taught myself everything I know about this industry, and there is nothing stopping you from doing the same. I was convinced I was stupid until around two years ago, though if I’m honest it might have been last year. I have felt othered the majority of my life, convinced by people that I am incapable or unwelcome, and as I’ve become more articulate and confident in who I am and what I believe in, I have noticed that the only people that seek to degrade or suppress are those of weak minds and weaker wills — Business Idiots in different forms and flavors. I have learned to accept who I am — that I am not like most people — and people conflate my passion and vigor with anger or hate, when what they’re experiencing is somebody different who deeply resents what the powerful have done to the computer. And while I complain about the state of media, what I’ve seen in the last year is that there are many, many people like me — both readers and peers — that resent things in the same way. I conflated being different with being alone, and I couldn’t be more wrong. For those of you that don’t wish to lick the boots of the people fucking up every tech product, the tent is large, it’s a big club, and you’re absolutely in it. A better tech industry is one where the people writing about it hold it accountable, pushing it toward creating the experiences and connectivity that truly change the world rather than repeating and reinforcing the status quo. Don’t watch the mouth, watch the hands. These companies will tell you that they’re amazing as many times as they want, but you don’t need to prove that — they do. I don’t care if you tell a single human soul about my work, but if it helps you understand these people better, use it to teach other people. These people may seem all-powerful, but they’ve built the Rot Economy on a combination of anonymity and a placant press, but pressure against them starts with you and those you know understanding how their businesses work, and trusting that you can understand because you absolutely can. Millions of people understanding how these people run their companies and how poorly they’ve built their software will stop people like Sundar Pichai from being able to quietly burn Google Search to the ground. People like Sam Altman are gambling that you are easily-confused, easily-defeated and incurious, when you could be writing thousands of words on a newsletter that you never, ever edit for brevity. You can understand every fucking part of their business — the economics of OpenAI, the flimsy promises of Salesforce, the destruction of Google Search — and you can tell everybody you know about it, and suddenly it won’t be so easy for these wretched creeps to continue thriving. I know it sounds small, and like your role is even smaller, but the reason they’ve grown so rapaciously is driven by the sense that the work they do is some sort of black magic, when it’s really fucking stupid and boring finance stapled onto a tech industry that’s run out of ideas. You are more than capable of understanding this entire world — including the technology, along with the finances that ultimately decide what technology gets made next. These people have got rich and famous and escaped all blame by casting themselves as somehow above us, when if I’m honest, I’ve never looked down on somebody quite as much as I do the current gaggle of management consultant fucks that have driven Silicon Valley into the ground.

Full Content:
Have you ever heard Sam Altman speak? I’m serious, have you ever heard this man say words from his mouth? Here is but one of the trenchant insights from Sam Altman in his agonizing 37-minute-long podcast conversation with his brother Jack Altman from last week: When asked why he believes AI will “discover new science,” Altman says that “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” adding that “we’ve a long way to go,” and that he “think[s] we know what to do,” adding that OpenAI’s o3 model “is already pretty smart,” and that he’s heard people say “wow, this is like a good PHD.” That’s the entire answer! It’s complete nonsense! Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, a company allegedly worth $300 billion to venture capitalists and SoftBank, kind of sounds like a huge idiot! “But Ed!” you cry. “You can’t just call Sam Altman an idiot! He isn’t stupid! He runs a big company, and he’s super successful!” My counter to that is, first, yes I can, I’m doing it right now. Second, if Altman didn’t want to be called stupid, he wouldn’t say stupid shit with a straight face to a massive global audience. My favourite part of the interview is near the beginning: This is a nonsensical conversation, and both of them sound very, very stupid. “So, is this going to make new science or make science faster?” “Yeah, I hear scientists are using AI to go faster [CITATION NEEDED], but if a human scientist goes three times faster [CITATION NEEDED] using my model that would be good. Also I heard from a guy that he heard a guy who did biology who said ‘this helped.’” Phenomenal! Give this guy $40 billion or more dollars every year until he creates a superintelligence, that’ll fucking work. Here are some other incredible quotes from the genius mind of Sam Altman: This is gobbledygook, nonsense, bullshit peddled by a guy who has only the most tangential understanding of the technology his company is building. Every single interview with Sam Altman is like this, every single one, ever since he became a prominent tech investor and founder. Without fail. And the sad part is that Altman isn’t alone in this. Sundar Pichai, when asked one of Nilay Patel’s patented 100-word-plus-questions about Jony Ive and Sam Altman’s new (and likely heavily delayed) hardware startup: The fuck are you on about, Sundar? Your answer to a question about whether you anticipate more competition is to say “yeah I think people are gonna make shit we haven’t come up with and uhh, hardware, can’t wait!” While I think Pichai is likely a little smarter than Altman, in the same way that Satya Nadella is a little smarter than Pichai, and in the same way that a golden retriever is smarter than a chihuahua. That said, none of these men are superintelligences, nor, when pressed, do they ever seem to have any actual answers. Let’s see what Satya Nadella of Microsoft answered when asked about how exactly it’s going to get to (and I paraphrase Dwarkesh Patel’s mealy-mouthed question) $130 billion in AI revenue “through AGI”: This quote has been used as a means of suggesting that Nadella is saying that “generative AI is generating basically no value,” which, while somewhat true, obfuscates its true meaning: Satya Nadella isn’t saying a fucking thing. The question was “how do you get Microsoft to $130 billion in revenue,” and Satya Nadella’s answer was to say “uhhh, abundance, uhhh, explosion, uhhhhh, GDP! Growth! Industrial revolution! Inflation-adjusted! Percentages! The winners will be the people who do stuff, and then productivity will go up!” This is fucking nonsense, and it’s time to stop idolizing these speciously-informed goobers. While kinder souls or Zitron-haters may read this and say “ahh, actually, what Nadella was saying was…” stop. I want to stop you there and suggest that perhaps a smart person should be able to speak clearly enough that their intent is obvious. It’s tempting to believe that there is some sort of intellectual barrier between you and the powerful — that the confusing and obtuse way that they speak is the sound of genius, rather than somebody who has learned a lot of smart-sounding words without ever learning what they mean. “But Ed, they’re trained to do this!” As someone who has media trained hundreds of people, there is only so much you can do to steer someone’s language. You cannot say to Sundar Pichai “hey man, can you sound more confusing?” You can, however, tell them what not to talk about and hope for the best. Sure, you can make them practice, sure, you can give them feedback, but people past a certain stage of power or popularity are going to talk however they want, and if they’re a big stupid idiot pretending to be smart, they’re going to sound exactly like this. Why? Because nobody in the media ever asks them to explain themselves. When you’ve spent your entire career being asked friendly-or-friendly-adjacent questions and never having someone say “wait, what does that mean?” you will continue to mutate in a pseudo-communicator that spits out information-adjacent bullshit. I am, to be clear, being very specific about that question. Powerful CEOs and founders never, ever get asked to explain what they’re saying, even when what they’re saying barely resembles an actual answer. Pichai, Altman and Nadella have always given this kind of empty-brained intellectual slop in response to questions because the media coddles them. These people are product managers and/or management consultants — and in Altman’s case, a savvy negotiator and manipulator known for “an absenteeism that rankled his peers and some of the startups he was supposed to nurture” as an investor at yCombinator, according to the Washington Post. By “coddle,” I mean these people are deliberately engaging in a combination of detective work and amnesia, where the reader or the listener is forced to simultaneously try and divine the meaning of their answer, while also not thinking too hard about the question the interviewer asked. Look at most modern business interviews. They involve a journalist asking a question, somebody giving an answer, and the journalist saying “okay!” and moving onto the next question, occasionally saying “but what about this?” when the appropriate response to many of the answers is to ask them to simplify them so that their meaning is clearer. A common response to all of this is to say that “interviewers can’t be antagonistic,” and I don’t think a lot of people understand what that means. It isn’t “antagonistic” to ask somebody to clearly articulate what they’re saying, nor is it “antagonistic” to say that you don’t understand, or that they didn’t answer the question you asked. If this is “antagonistic” to you, you are, intellectually-speaking, a giant fucking coward, because what you’re suggesting is that somebody cannot ask somebody to explain themselves, which is what an interview is. And I imagine nobody really wants to do this, because if you actually put these people on the spot, you’d realize the dark truth that I spoke of a few weeks ago: that the reason the powerful sound like idiots is because, well, they’re idiots. They sound like Business Idiots and create products to sell to Business Idiots, because Business Idiots run most companies and buy solutions based on what the last Business Idiot told them. To quote the excellent Nik Suresh: I know some of you might read this and say “these people can’t be stupid! These people run companies! They make huge deals! They read all these books!” and my answer is that some of the stupidest people I’ve ever met have read more books than you or I will read in a lifetime. While they might be smart when it comes to corporate chess moves or saying “this product category should do this,” none of these men — not Altman, Pichai or Nadella — actually has a hand in the design or creation of any of the things their companies make, and they never, ever have. Regardless, I have a larger point: it’s time to start mocking these people and tearing down their legends as geniuses of industry. They are not better than us, nor are they responsible for anything that their companies build other than the share price (which is a meaningless figure) and the accumulation of power and resources. These men are neither smart nor intellectually superior, and it’s time to start treating them as such. These people are powerful because they have names that are protected by the press. They are powerful because it is seen as unseemly to mock them because they are rich and “running a company,” a kind of corporate fealty that I find deeply unbecoming of an adult. We are, at most, customers. We do not “owe them” anything. We are long past the point when any of the people running these companies actually invented anything they sell. iIf anything, they owe us something, because they are selling us a product, even if said product is free and monetised by advertising. While reporters — as anyone — should have some degree of professionalism in interviews or covering subjects, there is no reason to treat these people as special, even if they have managed to raise a lot of money or their product is popular, because if that were the case we’d have far more coverage of defense contractor Lockheed Martin. It made $1.71 billion in profit last quarter, and hasn’t had a single quarter under a billion dollars in the last year. I’m being a little glib, but the logic behind covering OpenAI is, at this point, “it makes a lot of money and its product is popular,” which is also a fitting description of Lockheed Martin. The difference is that OpenAI has a consumer product that loses billions of dollars, and Lockheed Martin has products that makes billions of dollars by removing consumers from the Earth. Both of them are environmentally destructive. Covering OpenAI sure doesn’t seem to be about the tech, because if you looked at the tech you’d have to understand the tech, you’d see that the user numbers weren’t there outside of the 500 million people using ChatGPT, of which very few are actually paying for the product, and that the term “user” encompasses everything from the most occasional users who log in out of curiosity, to people who are actually using it as part of their daily lives. If covering OpenAI was about the tech, you’d read about how the tech itself doesn’t seem to have a ton of mass-market use cases, and those use cases aren’t really the kind of things that you’d pay for. If they did, there’d be articles that definitively discussed them versus articles in the New York Times about “everybody using AI” that boil down to “I use ChatGPT as search now” and “I heard a guy who asked it to teach him about modern art.” Yet men like Dario Amodei and Sam Altman continue to be elevated because they are “building the future,” even if they don’t seem to have built it yet, or have the ability to clearly articulate what that future actually looks like. Anthropic has now put out multiple stories suggesting that its generative AI will “blackmail” people as a means of stopping a user from turning off the system, something which is so obviously the company prompting its models to do so. Every member of the media covering this uncritically should feel ashamed of themselves. Sadly, this is all a result of the halo effect of being a Guy Who Raised Money or Guy Who Runs Big Company. We must, as human beings, assume that these people are smart, and that they’d never mislead us, because if we accept that they aren’t smart and that they willingly mislead us, we’d have to accept that the powerful are, well, bad and possibly unremarkable. And if they’re untrustworthy people that don’t seem that smart, we have to accept that the world is deeply unfair, and caters to people like them far more than it caters to people like us. We do not owe Satya Nadella any respect because he’s the CEO of Microsoft. If anything, we should show him outright scorn for the state of Microsoft products. Microsoft Teams is an insulting mess that only sometimes works, leaving workers spending 57% of their time either in Teams Chat, Teams Meetings or sending emails according to a Microsoft study. MSN.com is an abomination read by hundreds of millions of people a month, bloated with intrusive advertisements, attempts to trick you into downloading an app, and quasi-content that may or may not be AI generated. There are few products on the modern internet that show more contempt for the user -- other than, of course, Skype, a product that Microsoft let languish for more than a decade, the product so thoroughly engorged with spam that leaving it unattended for more than a month left you with a hundred unread messages from Eastern European romance scammers. Microsoft finally killed it in May. Products like Word and Excel don’t need improving, but that doesn’t stop Microsoft from trying, bloating them with odd user interface choices and forcing users to fight with popups to use an AI-powered Copilot that most of them hate. Why, exactly, are we meant to show these people respect? Because they run a company that provides a continually-disintegrating service? Because that service has such a powerful monopoly that it’s difficult to leave it if you’re interacting with other people or businesses? I think it’s because we live in Hell. The modern tech ecosystem is so utterly vile. Every single day our tech breaks in new and inventive ways, our iPhones resetting at random, random apps not accepting button presses, our Bluetooth disconnecting, our word processors harassing us to “try and use AI” while no longer offering us suggestions for typos, and our useful products replaced with useless shit, like how Google’s previously-functional assistants were replaced with generative AI that makes them tangibly worse so that Google can claim it has 350 million monthly active Gemini users. Yet the tech and business media acts as if everything is fine. It isn’t fine! It’s all really fucked! You can call me a cynic or a pessimist or every name under the sun, but the stakes have never been higher, and the damage never more wide-spread. Everything feels broken, and covering these companies as if it isn’t is insulting to your readers and your own intelligence. Look at the state of your computer or phone and tell me anything feels congruent or intentional rather than an endless battle of incentives. Look at the notifications on your phone and count the number of them that have absolutely nothing to do with information you actively need. As we speak, I have a notification from Adobe Lightroom, an app I use occasionally to edit photos, that tells me “Elevate any scene - now enhance people, sky, water and more with Quick Actions.” Zerocam, an app that brands itself “the first anti-AI camera app” where you “capture moments, not megapixels,” gave me a notification asking if I took a photo today. Amazon notified me that there is a deal picked just for me — a battery pack that I bought several months ago. Every single company that sends notifications like these should be mocked, but we have accepted such vile conditions as the norm. Apple should be tarred and feathered for allowing companies to send spam notifications, and yet it isn’t because, by and large, Apple is less vile and less exploitative than Microsoft, Google or Amazon. If you are reading this as a member of the tech press, seriously, please look at your daily experience with tech. Count the number of times that your day or a task is interrupted by poorly-designed software or hardware (such as the many, many times Zoom or Teams has a problem with Bluetooth, or a website just doesn’t load, or you type something into your browser and it just doesn’t do anything), or when the software you use either actively impedes you (hey, did you want to use AI? No? You sure?) or refuses to work in a logical way (see: Google Drive). There are tens of thousands of stories like this every day, and if you talked to people, you’d see how widespread it is…or maybe, I dunno, see that it’s happening to you too? There are people responsible, and the tech media writes about them every day. I realize it seems weird to constantly write that a company is releasing broken, convoluted software, but hey, if we can write 300,000 stories about how crime-ridden New York City is, why can’t we write three of them about how fucked Microsoft Office or Google Search have become? And why can’t we talk to the people in power about it? Is it because the questions are too hard to ask? Is it because it feels icky to interrupt Satya Nadella as he waffles on about using Copilot all the time by saying “hey man, Microsoft Teams is broken, tons of people feel this way, why?” or “why have you let MSN.com turn into a hub of AI slop and outright disinformation?” Oh no! You won’t get your access! Wahh! Who cares? Write a story about how Microsoft has become so unbelievably profitable as its products get worse, and talk about how weird and bad that is for the world! Ask Nadella those tough questions, or publish that Microsoft’s PR wouldn’t let you! These people are neither articulate nor wise, and whatever “intelligence” they may claim to have doesn’t seem to manifest in good products or intelligent statements. So why treat them like they’re smart? Why show them deference or pleasantries? These people have crapped up our digital lives at scale, and they deserve contempt, or at the very least a stern fucking reception. I realize I’m repeating points I’ve made again and again, but why is there such a halo around these fucking bozos? I’m serious! Why are we so protective of these guys? We’re more than happy to criticise celebrities, musicians, professional sports players, and politicians (fucking barely), but the business class is somehow protected outside of the occasional willingness to say that Elon Musk might have sort have done something wrong. I’m not denying there are critics. We have Molly White, Edward Ongweso Jr, Brian Merchant and — at a major outlet like CNN, no less! — one of the greatest living business writers in Allison Morrow. I believe that tech criticism is a barely-explored and hugely-profitable industry if we treated tech journalism less like the society pages and more like a force to hold the most powerful people in the world accountable as they continually harm billions of people in subtle ways. People are angry, and they aren’t stupid, and they want to see that anger reflected in the stories they read — and the meek deference we show to dumb fucking tech leaders is the opposite of that. As I’ve said before: we live in an era of digital tinnitus, nagged by notifications, warring with software ostensibly built for us that acts as if we’re the enemy. And if we’re the enemy, we should treat those building this software as the enemy in return. We are their customers, and they have failed us. The entire approach to business owners, especially in tech, is ridiculous. These people are selling us a product and the product fucking stinks! Put aside however you feel about generative AI for a second and face one very simple point: it doesn’t do enough, it’s really not cool at all, and we’re being forced to use it. I realize that some of you may want them to succeed, or want to be the person who tells everybody that they did so. I get that there are rewards for you — promotions, new positions, TV appearances repeating exactly what the powerful did and why they did it, or a plush role as that company’s head of communications — but I am telling you, your readers and viewers are waking up to it, and they feel like you have contempt for them and contempt for the truth. It’s easy — and common! — to try and dismiss my work as some sort of hater’s screed, a “cynical” approach to a tech industry that’s trying “brave new things” or whatever. In my opinion, there’s nothing more cynical than watching billions of people get shipped increasingly-shitty and expensive solutions and then get defensive of the people shipping them, and hostile to the people who are complaining that the products they use suck. I am angry at these companies because they have, at scale, torn down a tech industry that allowed me to be who I am today, and their intentional and disgraceful moves fill me full of disgust. I have watched the tech media move away from covering “technology” and more toward covering the people behind it, to the point that the actual outputs — the software and hardware we use every day — have taken a backseat to stories about whether Elon Musk does or doesn’t use a computer, which is meaningless, empty gossip journalism built to be shared by peers and nothing else. And please, please do not talk about optimism. If you are blindly saying that everything OpenAI does is cool and awesome and interesting, you aren’t being optimistic — you’re telling other people to be optimistic about a company’s success. It isn’t “optimistic” to believe that a company is going to build powerful AI despite it failing to do so. It’s propaganda, and yes, this is also the case if you simply don’t do the research to form a real opinion. I am not a pessimist because I criticize these companies, and framing me as one is cowardly and ignorant. If you are so weak-willed and speciously-informed that you can’t see somebody criticise a company without outright dismissing them as “a hater” or “pessimist,” you are an insult to journalism or analysis, and you know it in your wretched little heart. My heart sings with a firm belief in the things I think, founded on rigorous structures of knowledge that I’ve gained from reading things and talking to people, because something in me is incapable of being swayed by something just because everybody else is. You are assuming people are right because it is inconvenient and uncomfortable to accept they may not be, because doing so requires you to reckon with a market-wide hysteria founded on desperation and a lack of hyper-growth markets left in the tech industry. Worse still, in engaging with faux-optimism, you are failing to protect your readers and the general public. And if that’s what you want to do, ask yourself why! Why do you want these companies to win? What is it you want them to win? Do you want them to be rich? Do you want to be the person that told people they would be first? What is the world you want, and what does it look like, and how does doing your job in this way work toward creating that world? This isn’t optimism — it’s horse-trading, or strategic alignment behind powerful entities. It is choosing a side, because your side isn’t with the reader or the truth. If it was — even if you believed generative AI was powerful and that they simply didn’t understand — your duty would be to educate the reader in a clear-set and obvious way, and if you can’t find a way to do so, acknowledging that and explaining why. True optimism requires you to have a deep, meaningful understanding of things so that you can engage in real hope — a magical feeling, one that can buoy you in the most challenging times. What many claim is “optimism” is actually blind faith, the likes of which you’ll see at a roulette table. Or, of course, knowingly peddling propaganda. Let’s even take a different tact: say you actually want these companies to “build powerful AI,” and believe they’re smart enough to do so. Say that, somehow, looking at their decaying finances, the lack of revenue, the lack of growth, and the remarkable lack of use cases, you still come out of it saying “sure, I think they’re going to do this!” How? Why haven’t they done it yet? Why, three years in, are we still unable to describe what ChatGPT actually does, and why we need it? Take away how much money OpenAI makes for a second (and, indeed, how much it loses). Does this product actually really inspire anything in you? What is it that’s magical about this? And, on a business level, what is it I’m meant to be impressed by, exactly? OpenAI has — allegedly — hit “$10 billion in annualized revenue” (essentially the biggest month it can find, multiplied by 12), which is…not that much, really, considering it’s the most prominent company in the software world, with the biggest brand, and with the attention of the entirety of the world’s media. It has, allegedly, 500 million weekly active users — and, by the last count, only 15.5 million paying subscribers, an absolutely putrid conversion rate even before you realize that the actual conversion rate would be monthly active subscribers. That’s how any real software company actually defines its metrics, by the fucking way. Why is this impressive? Because it grew fast? It literally had more PR and more marketing and more attention and more opportunities to sell to more people than any company has ever had in the history of anything. Every single industry has been told to think about AI for three years, and they’ve been told to do so because of a company called OpenAI. There isn’t a single god damn product since Google or Facebook that has had this level of media pressure, and both of those companies launched without the massive amount of media (and social media) that we have today. Having literally everybody talking about your product all the time for years is pretty useful! Why isn’t it making more money? Why are we taking any of these people seriously? Mark Zuckerberg paid $14.3 billion for Scale AI, an AI data company, as a means of hiring its CEO Alexandr Wang to run his “superintelligence” team, has been offering random OpenAI employees $100 million to join Meta, thought about buying both AI search company Perplexity and generative video company Runway and even tried to buy OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever’s pre-product “$32bn valuation” non-company Safe Superintelligence, settling instead on hiring its CEO Daniel Gross and buying his venture fund for some fucking reason. When you put aside the big numbers, these are the actions of a desperate dimwit with a failing product trying to buy his way to making generative AI into a “superintelligence,” something that Meta’s own Chief AI scientist Yan LeCun says isn’t going to work. By assuming that there is some sort of grand strategy behind these moves beyond “if we get enough smart people together something will happen,” you help boost the powerful’s messaging and buoy their stock valuations. You are not educating anybody by humouring these goofballs. In fact, the right way to approach this would be to ask why Meta, a multi-trillion dollar market cap company with a near-monopoly over all social media, is spending billions of dollars in what appears to be a totally irresponsible way. Instead, people are suggesting this is Mark Zuckerberg’s genius at work. Anyway, putting that aside, what exactly is the impressive part of generative AI again? The fucking code? Enough about the code, I’m tired of hearing about the code, I swear to god you people think that being a software engineer is only coding and that it’s fine if you ship “mediocre code,” as if bad code can’t bring down entire organizations. What do you think a software engineer does? Is all they do code? If you think the answer is yes, you are wrong! Human beings may make mistakes in writing code, but they at least know what a mistake looks like, which a generative AI does not, because a generative AI doesn’t know what anything is, or anything at all, because it is a probabilistic model. Congratulations! You made another way in which software engineers can automate parts of their jobs — stop being so fucking excited about the idea that people are going to lose their livelihoods! It’s nasty, and founded on absolutely nothing other than your adulation for the powerful! These models are dangerous and chaotic, built with little intention or regard for the future, just like the rest of big tech’s products. ChatGPT would’ve been a much smaller deal if Google had any interest in turning Google Search into a product that truly answered a query (as opposed to generating more of them to show more impressions to advertisers) — a nuanced search engine that took a user’s query and spat out a series of websites that might help answer said question rather than just summarising a few of them for an answer. And if you ever need proof that Google just doesn’t know how to fucking innovate anymore, look at AI Summaries, a product that both misunderstands search and why people use ChatGPT as a search replacement. While OpenAI may “summarise” stuff to give an answer, it at the very least gives something approximating a true answer, rather than a summary that feels like an absentee parent trying to get rid of you and then throwing you $20 in the hopes you’ll leave them alone. If Google Search truly evolved, ChatGPT wouldn’t really matter, because the idea of a machine that can theoretically answer a question is kind of why people used fucking Google in the fucking first place. Again, why are we not describing this company as the business equivalent of a banana republic? It’s actively making its shit worse to juice growth, and it’s really obvious how badly it sucks. Why doesn’t the state of Google dominate tech news, just like how random ketamine-fuelled tweets from Elon Musk do? Why aren’t we, collectively, repulsed by Google as a company? Why aren’t we, collectively, repulsed by OpenAI? No matter how big ChatGPT is, the fact that there’s a product out there with hundreds of millions of users that constantly gets answers wrong is a genuinely worrying thing for society, and that’s before you get to the environmental damage, the fact it trained its models on millions of people’s art and writing, and oh, I dunno, the fact it plans to lose over a hundred billions of dollars before becoming profitable? Why are we not more horrified? Why are we not more forlorn that this is where hundreds of billions of dollars are being forced? The most prominent company in the tech industry is an unstable monolith with a vague product that can only make $10 billion a year (revenue, not profit) as the very fabric of its existence is shoved down the throat of every executive in the world at once. Also, if it’s not fed $20 billion to $40 billion a year, it will die. Give me a fucking break. I don’t know, I sound pretty ornery, I get accused of being a hater or missing the grand mystery of this bullshit every few minutes by somebody with an AI avatar of a guy who looks like he’s banned from multiple branches of Best Buy, I understand there’s things that people do with Large Language Models, I am aware, but none of it matters because the way they’re being discussed is like we’re two steps from digitally replacing hundreds of millions of people. The reality is far simpler: we have an industry that has spent nearly half a trillion dollars between its capital expenditures and venture capital funding to create another industry with the combined revenue of the fucking smartwatch industry. What I’m writing isn’t inflammatory — in fact, it’s far more deeply rooted in reality than those claiming that OpenAI is building the future. Let’s do some fucking mathematics! Projected Big Tech Capital Expenditures in 2025 and revenue from AI: That’s $327 billion this year, with a total revenue of…what, $18 billion of revenue? And that’s not profit! And that’s if we include OpenAI’s spend on Azure. Even if every single one of these companies was making $18 billion in revenue a year from this it wouldn’t be great, but it’s more than likely that these chunderfucks can’t even pull together the projected revenue ($32 billion) of the global smartwatch industry! What a joke! “Wuhh, but what about OpenAI?” What about OpenAI? I’ve written about this so much. So what, OpenAI makes $12.7 billion this year, but loses $14 billion, what does that mean to you, exactly? What’re you going to say? The cost of inference is coming down? No, the cost that people are being charged is going down, we have no firm data on the actual costs because the companies don’t want to talk about it, and yes, it will absolutely lower prices to compete with other companies. The Information just reported that OpenAI was doing this to compete with Microsoft last week! Hey, quick question — wasn’t SoftBank meant to spend $3 billion annually on OpenAI’s software? Did that happen? Anyway, even if we add OpenAI’s revenue to the pot, we are at $30.7 billion. If we add the supposed $1 billion in revenue from training data startup Surge, $300 million in “annualized revenue” from Turing, optimistically assume that Perplexity will have $100 million (up from $34 million in 2024, where it burned $65 million) in revenue in 2025, and assume that Anysphere’s (which makes Cursor) $200 million run rate stays consistent through 2025, we are at…$32.3 billion. But I'm not being fair, am I? I didn’t include many of the names from The Information’s generative AI database. Prepare yourself, this is gonna be annoying! So let's add some more. We’ve got $3 billion from Anthropic, $870 million from Scale (now part of Meta), another alleged $300 million for Anysphere (The Information claims $500 million in ARR), we consider Neo4j’s “>$200 million ARR” to mean “$200 million,” Midjourney’s “>$200 million ARR” to mean $200m, Ironclad’s “>$150 million ARR” to mean $150 million ARR, Glean’s $103 million ARR, Together AI’s $100 million ARR, Moveworks’ $100 million ARR, Abridge’s $100 million ARR, Synthesia’s $100 million ARR, WEKA’s “>$100 million ARR” to mean $100m ARR, Windsurf’s $100m ARR, Runway’s $84 million ARR, Elevenlabs’ “>$100m ARR” to mean $100m ARR, Cohere’s $70m ARR, Jasper’s “>$60m ARR” to mean $60m, Harvey’s $50m ARR, Ada’s “>$50m ARR” to mean $50m, Photoroom’s $50m ARR…and then assumed the combined ARR of the remainders are somewhere in the region of a very generous $200m, we get… Less than $39 billion dollars of total revenue in the entire generative AI industry. Jesus fucking christ! According to The Information, generative AI companies have raised more than $18.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025, after investing $21 billion in Q4 2024 and $4 billion in Q3 2024 for a grand total of $43.8 billion, or a total of $370.8 billion of investment and capital expenditures for an industry that, despite being the single-most talked about thing on the planet, cannot even create a tenth of the dollars it requires to make it work. These companies are predominantly unprofitable, perpetually searching for product-market fit, and even when they find it, seem incapable of generating revenue numbers that remotely justify their valuations. If I’m honest, I think the truly radical position here is the one taken by most tech reporters that would rather take the lazy position of “well Uber lost a lot of money!” than think for two seconds about whether we’re all being sold a line of shit. What we’re watching is a mountain of waste perpetuated by the least-charming failsons of our generation. Nobody should be giving Satya Nadella or Sam Altman a glossy profile — they should be asking direct, brutal questions, much like Joanna Stern just did of Apple’s Craig Federighi, who had absolutely fucking nothing to share because he has never been pushed like this. Put aside the money for a second and be honest: these men are pathetic, unimpressive, uninventive, and dreadfully, dreadfully boring. Anthropic’s Wario (Sorry, Dario) Amodei and OpenAI’s Sam Altman have far more in common with televangelist Joel Olstein than they’ll ever have with Steve Jobs or any number of people that have actually invented things, and they got that way because we took them seriously instead of saying “wait, what do you mean?” To a single one of their wrongheaded, oafish and dim-witted hype-burps. It’s boring! I’m terribly, horribly bored, and if you’re interested in this shit I am genuinely curious why, especially if you’re a reporter, because right now the “innovation” happening in AI is, at best, further mutations of the Software As A Service business model, providing far less value than previous innovations at a calamitous cost. Reasoning models don’t even reason, as proven by an Apple paper released a few weeks ago, and agents as a concept are fucked because large language models are inherently unreliable — and yes, a study out of fucking Salesforce found that agents began to break down when given multi-step tasks, such as “any task you’d want to have an agent automate.” So, here’s my radical suggestion: start making fun of these people. They are not charming. They are not building anything. They have scooted along amassing billions of dollars promising the world and delivering you a hill of dirt. They deserve our derision — or, at the very least, our deep, unerring suspicion, if not for what they’ve done, but for what they’ve not done. Sam Altman is nowhere near delivering a functioning agent, let alone anything approaching intelligence, and really only has one skill: making other companies risk a bunch of money on his stupid ideas. No, really! He convinced Oracle to buy $40 billion of NVIDIA chips to put in the Abilene Texas “Stargate” data center, despite the fact that the Stargate organization has yet to be formed (as reported by The Information). SoftBank and Microsoft pay all of OpenAI’s bills, and the media does his marketing for him. OpenAI is, as I said, quite literally a banana republic. It requires the media and the markets to make up why it has to exist, it requires other companies to pump it full of money and build its infrastructure, and it doesn’t even make products that matter, with Sam Altman constantly talking about all the exciting shit other people will build. You can keep honking about how “it built the API that will power the future,” but if that’s the case, where’s the fucking future, exactly? Where is it? What am I looking at here? Where’s the economic activity? Where’s the productivity? The returns suck! The costs are too high! Why am I the radical person for saying this? This entire situation is absolutely god damn ridiculous, an incomparable waste even if it somehow went in the green. For the horrendous amounts of capital invested in generative AI to make sense, the industry would have to have revenue that dwarfed the smartphone and enterprise SaaS market combined, rather than less than half of that of the mobile gaming industry. Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Wario Amodei, Tim Cook, Andy Jassy — they deserve to be laughed at, mocked, or at the very least interrogated vigorously, because their combined might has produced no exciting or interesting products outside of, at best, what will amount to a productivity upgrade for integrated development environments and faster ways to throw out code that may or may not be reliable. These things aren’t nothing, but they’re nowhere near the something that we’re being promised. So I put it to you, dear reader: why are we taking them seriously? What is there to take seriously other than their ability to force stuff on people? And I’ll leave you with a question: how do they manage to keep doing this, exactly? They always seem to find new growth, every single quarter, without fail? Is it because they keep coming up with new ideas? Or is it because they come up with new ideas to get more money, a vastly different choice that involves increasing the prices of products or making them worse so that they can show you more advertisements. My positions are not radical, and if you believe they are, your deference to the powerful disgusts me. In any case, I want to end this with something inspirational, because I believe that things change when regular people feel stronger and more capable. I want you to know that you are fully capable of understanding all of this. I don’t care if you “aren’t a numbers person” or “don’t get business.’ I don’t have a single iota of economics training, and everything you’ve ever read me write has been something I’ve had to learn. I was a layperson right up until I learned the stuff, then I became a stuff-knower, just like you can be. The tech industry, the finance industry, the entire mechanisms of capitalism want you to believe that everything they do is magical and complex, when it’s all far more obvious than you’d believe. You don’t have to understand the entire fundamentals of finance to know how venture capital works — they buy percentages of companies at a valuation that they hope is much lower than the company would be worth in the future. You don’t need to be technical to know that Large Language Models generate a response based on billions of pieces of training data, and by guessing at what the next bit of text in a line should be based on what it’s seen previously. These people love to say “ah, but didn’t you see-” and present an anecdote, when no anecdote will ever defeat the basics of “your business doesn’t make any money, the software doesn’t do the things you claim it’s meant to, and you have no path to profitability.” They can yammer at you all they want about “lots of people using ChatGPT,” but that doesn’t change the fact that ChatGPT just isn’t that revolutionary, and their only play here is to make you feel stupid rather than actually showing you why it’s so fucking revolutionary. This is the argument of a manipulator and a coward, and you are above such things. You don’t really have to be a specialist in anything to pry this shit apart, which is why so much of my work is either engaging to those who learn something from it or frustrating to those that intentionally deceive others through gobbledygook hype-schpiel. I will sit here and explain every fucking part of this horrid chain of freaks, and break it down into whatever pieces it takes to educate as many people as I have to to make things change. I also must be clear that I am nobody. I started writing this newsletter with 300 subscribers and no reason other than the fact I wanted to, and four years later I have nearly 64,000 subscribers and an award-winning podcast. I have no economics training, no special access, no deep sources, just the ability to look at things that are happening and say stuff. I taught myself everything I know about this industry, and there is nothing stopping you from doing the same. I was convinced I was stupid until around two years ago, though if I’m honest it might have been last year. I have felt othered the majority of my life, convinced by people that I am incapable or unwelcome, and as I’ve become more articulate and confident in who I am and what I believe in, I have noticed that the only people that seek to degrade or suppress are those of weak minds and weaker wills — Business Idiots in different forms and flavors. I have learned to accept who I am — that I am not like most people — and people conflate my passion and vigor with anger or hate, when what they’re experiencing is somebody different who deeply resents what the powerful have done to the computer. And while I complain about the state of media, what I’ve seen in the last year is that there are many, many people like me — both readers and peers — that resent things in the same way. I conflated being different with being alone, and I couldn’t be more wrong. For those of you that don’t wish to lick the boots of the people fucking up every tech product, the tent is large, it’s a big club, and you’re absolutely in it. A better tech industry is one where the people writing about it hold it accountable, pushing it toward creating the experiences and connectivity that truly change the world rather than repeating and reinforcing the status quo. Don’t watch the mouth, watch the hands. These companies will tell you that they’re amazing as many times as they want, but you don’t need to prove that — they do. I don’t care if you tell a single human soul about my work, but if it helps you understand these people better, use it to teach other people. These people may seem all-powerful, but they’ve built the Rot Economy on a combination of anonymity and a placant press, but pressure against them starts with you and those you know understanding how their businesses work, and trusting that you can understand because you absolutely can. Millions of people understanding how these people run their companies and how poorly they’ve built their software will stop people like Sundar Pichai from being able to quietly burn Google Search to the ground. People like Sam Altman are gambling that you are easily-confused, easily-defeated and incurious, when you could be writing thousands of words on a newsletter that you never, ever edit for brevity. You can understand every fucking part of their business — the economics of OpenAI, the flimsy promises of Salesforce, the destruction of Google Search — and you can tell everybody you know about it, and suddenly it won’t be so easy for these wretched creeps to continue thriving. I know it sounds small, and like your role is even smaller, but the reason they’ve grown so rapaciously is driven by the sense that the work they do is some sort of black magic, when it’s really fucking stupid and boring finance stapled onto a tech industry that’s run out of ideas. You are more than capable of understanding this entire world — including the technology, along with the finances that ultimately decide what technology gets made next. These people have got rich and famous and escaped all blame by casting themselves as somehow above us, when if I’m honest, I’ve never looked down on somebody quite as much as I do the current gaggle of management consultant fucks that have driven Silicon Valley into the ground.

Title: Lowe’s CEO warns young workers to stay away from the corner office: ‘AI isn’t going to fix a hole in your roof’

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. Anxiety about an AI job bloodbath is everywhere. As generative-AI tools like ChatGPT advance at lightning speed, even high-skilled roles like software engineering appear to be at risk. But according to Lowe’s CEO Marvin Ellison, the reality of AI’s impact on the workforce is far more grounded. “AI isn’t going to fix a hole in your roof,” Ellison, chief executive of the home-improvement retail giant, said at Business Roundtable’s CEO Workforce Forum earlier this month. “It’s not going to respond to an electrical issue in your home,” he said. “It’s not going to stop your water heater from leaking.” Particularly for Gen Z, who are facing an uphill battle thanks to slowed hiring among recent graduates, Ellison reassures them there are job opportunities—as long as you are willing to give up dreams of the corner office. “When young people come to me and they desire to work in the corporate office, my advice to them is, Stay as close to the cash register as you can,” he said. “Stay close to the customers because you will always have employment opportunities to grow.” And while his words may sound ironic considering how technology is the reason for self-checkout, Ellison is a believer that mastering the skills AI doesn’t have is a wise move. Ellison didn’t immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Ellison’s comments come at a time when there’s a fierce debate among business leaders about the impacts of AI, especially on young talent. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned the technology could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs, and Amazon recently announced it will soon cut its corporate workforce thanks to the technology. However, OpenAI chief operating officer Brad Lightcap is more optimistic. “We look at the problem and opportunity of deploying AI into every company on earth, and we have yet to see any evidence that people are kind of wholesale replacing entry-level jobs,” Lightcap said on the Hard Fork podcast. Some business leaders agree one growing pathway to success is the skilled trade industry. After all, construction, utilities, as well as oil, gas, and mining are the fastest-growing industries for new grads, according to LinkedIn’s 2025 Grad Guide. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said earlier this year electricians in particular are so desperately needed the U.S. could run out of them, thanks in part to growing demand and the deportation of skilled workers. “I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians, that we need to build out AI data centers,” Fink told an audience at CERAWeek, an S&P Global energy conference hosted in Houston. “We just don’t have enough.” According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, demand for plumbers (6%), roofers (6%), and electricians (11%) is expected to grow over the next decade—and each rate is faster than the national average of all occupations. However, a McKinsey report suggests the need for young people to pursue critical trade skills is even more dire due to the aging of existing skilled trade workers; in fact, hiring for critical skilled roles could be more than 20 times the projected annual increase in new jobs between 2022 and 2032. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Apple Reportedly Has Numerous XR Headsets & Glasses Coming Between Now & 2028

Independent tech analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reports that Apple’s XR and smart glasses roadmap will feature multiple XR devices, including a spec-bumped Vision Pro slated to release later this year. At the far end of the spectrum, Kuo also says Apple is making AR glasses, reportedly coming in 2028. Kuo is a long-time tech analyst and respected figure in Apple product leaks. In a new blogpost, Kuo has laid out a timeline for a number of Apple XR releases, ostensibly based on various supply chain leaks. Kuo reports that a new Vision Pro featuring the company’s M5 chip is scheduled for mass production in Q3 2025, with 150,000–200,000 units expected to ship. This next Vision Pro is reportedly upgrading the chip from M2 to M5, but will otherwise retain the original specs. Kuo maintains the iterative approach is based on Vision Pro’s current position as a niche product, as the company hopes to use the next version to maintain market presence, reduce component stock, and further refine XR applications. Next, Kuo says Apple is preparing a much lighter headset, reportedly called ‘Vision Air’, set to release in Q3 2027. Vision Air is said to be dramatically lighter at over 40% less than the current Vision Pro, which weighs in at 21.2–22.9 ounces (600–650 g), excluding the battery. Kuo maintains Vision Air will include plastic lenses, magnesium alloys, fewer sensors, a top-tier iPhone chip, and be priced significantly lower to appeal to broader users. The true next-gen Vision device is said to be ‘Vision Pro 2’ though, which Kuo says could arrive in 2H 2028, replete with a full redesign, Mac-grade chip, reduced weight, and a lower price, signaling Apple’s shift to move away from niche XR products and move toward mainstream adoption. Meanwhile, Kuo says Apple is investing heavily in smart glasses. A Ray-Ban-like, audio-first wearable is expected to arrive in Q2 2027, Kuo says, noting that the company is hoping to manufacture 3–5 million units—ostensibly a significant push towards making its first smart glasses a mainstream success. Like Ray-Ban Meta, and the recently unveiled Oakley Meta HSTN, Apple’s smart glasses are said to have no display, rather offering audio playback, photo and video capture, an AI assistant, and both gesture and voice controls. Arguably the biggest claim among Kuo’s timeline is the mention of Apple XR Glasses, which the analyst maintains will include a color display (LCoS + waveguide) and AI features, making it the first true AR glasses from the company. Kuo says Apple is targeting release in 2H 2028, with a lighter variant being developed in parallel. This follows reports of Apple potentially scraping a more casual XR glasses-type viewer, which would be tethered to Apple devices and use birdbath optics. The device was originally planned for release in Q2 2026, but Kuo maintains it was paused in late 2024 due to insufficient differentiation, especially around weight. Granted, Apple is one of the most opaque black boxes in tech for a reason. The company historically announces products on stage, which typically also comes with a price and release date attached. While Kuo has a fairly reliable track record of reporting insider knowledge of Vision Pro, we’re taking this data dump with an equally-sized grain of salt. This article may contain affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and buy a product we may receive a small commission which helps support the publication. More information. Low specced, high-priced and served with plenty of Kool Aid. Some premium iPhones can't even run AI due to Apple's stingy memory. But they're the best and most excellently optimised things ever. Except when it comes to future proofing. Give me Samsung and similar any day. We owe a huge debt to Apple as regards smartphone evolution, but they're like your dad on the sofa now, wearing a jumper and watching Bowls. The minimum requirement for using Apple AI is an A17 Pro or A18, which double the NPU performance from ~16/17 TOPS on A15/A16 to 35 TOPS. All iPhones using the A17 Pro/A18 also come with 8GB of RAM compared to 6GB before, so you can run Apple AI on iPhone Pro/Plus from 2023 or all iPhones from 2024 or later. But it's not just the RAM that's the issue here. After years of annoyingly keeping the basic Mac configuration at 8GB, Apple now switched everything to at least 16GB esp. to be able to run Apple AI, so the stingy memory policy and obscene upgrade prices certainly play a part. But a lot of people using basic M1 MacBooks with 8GB RAM from late 2020 still see no reason to upgrade, because the speed is fine, and thanks to very fast SSDs and clever MacOS memory management, these 8GB will get you a lot further than on a Windows laptop. Just not for AI, which needs very fast access to gigabytes large models, with swapping not an option. So these users won't get Apple AI, which many consider a feature instead of a bug. And usually Apple devices get a lot longer support than anything Android, which may count for "future proofing". No doubt they are low specced, high-priced and served with plenty of Kool Aid. But as Apple controls the OS, the specs are typically well balanced for the majority of users. And even the most basic configuration will usually work just fine for at least half a decade with continued OS updates, though you might not get all of the latest features, and even longer security updates. TL;DR: 2025 M5 Vision Pro with the same issues, but more speed, for the enterprise market; 2027 A21 Vision Air for consumers, addressing the comfort/price issues, but otherwise offering the same experience as the current M2 AVP. A Vision Air makes a lot of sense, as it addresses high weight and price, which are the main issues most reviewers had/have with the AVP. By now Apple has learned how people use AVP, and can try to achieve the same experience with less/newer hardware. The M- and A-Series chips use the same types of cores, just in different configurations, with A-chips designed for low power mobile. By 2027 the M2 will be five years old, so a high end A-SoC should be faster, allowing for the same experience as the M2 AVP, but with less power/money/weight. And by reducing the huge amount of sensors to what is essential, they may be able to drop the extra R1 signal processor that works in parallel to the M2 in AVP. A more difficult question is who the M5 update is for. It not a redesign, mostly a SoC replacement with maybe some minor changes, similar to Pico 4 Ultra compared to Pico 4. But all it effectively does is bump up the speed, and this is the one area where AVP hasn't been widely criticized. Price/weight/power consumption/comfort all stay the same and will only be addressed by the Vision Air. So from a consumer perspective, they might as well have continued to sell the M2 AVP until the Air arrives. My guess is that this upgrade is mostly about pushing AVP for enterprise use instead of the consumer market. With no apps demanding it, regular customers won't really benefit from the extra power, but a large company running their own custom software might. Earlier this months Apple showed a couple of new features of visionOS 26, one of which was co-located AR, allowing several people using AVP in the same physical space to work together on virtual objects. This was demonstrated with Dassault Systèmes, who are a heavy weight in the aerospace CAD and simulation market and offer a number of compute-heavy engineering solutions. That's the type of software companies buy expensive workstation hardware for, and they most certainly would love every bit of speed they can get, money/power/weight be damned. If this is what Apple is going for, the next Apple Vision most XR users will care about will arrive in 2027 and no longer bear the "Pro" label. And what is released later this year will take the Pro more serious and explicitly target the enterprise market. Apple has done silent updates before, upping the specs without an actual product instructions, just offering a short press release. And if the M5 AVP is indeed aimed at the professional market, "the company historically announces products on stage, which typically also comes with a price and release date attached" may not apply here. So maybe don't expect any big announcement for later this year, or (mis-)interpret a lack of such announcements as Apple pulling back from XR. Ok, if the guy is right that’s getting ridiculous… …3 more years to have a true successor to AVP. It better go directly 8k per eye, holographic lenses with varifocal and weigh less than 150g by then because that’s next century in nerd years. And 40 percent lighter for a vision air with plastic lenses in 2 years, that’s pathetic both in terms of specs (still way too heavy) and way too late.. Apple is really a company falling apart. There is no excitement with them, since cook took over, it’s as dull as an insurance company. Yes, Tim Cook is for Apple what Bob Iger is for Disney. Profit and wokeness, but no soul. So for the 2027 Quest 4, we hope for 2.5K/3.5K microOLED, better passthrough, eye tracking, and XR2 Gen 3 with ~2.8x the graphics performance of the 2023 Quest 3, at roughly the same size/weight. And if Apple, who's 2024 AVP already offers 3.5K microOLEDs, excellent passthrough, eye tracking and ~50% more raw GPU performance than Quest 3, doesn't manage to one year after Quest 4 release an AVP2 that offers tech that doesn't even work as prototypes yet, at less than 1/3rd the weight of Quest 3, and technically completely unfeasible for anybody else, they are falling apart, because they are as dull as an insurance company. In the last 20 years, Apple has invented nothing but iPhones. – Always faster iPhones, sometimes a bit bigger, sometimes a bit smaller – Very small iPhones with a strap (iWatch) – Very large iPhones (iPad) – iPhones you can strap to your face (Apple Vision Pro) – Large foldable iPhones with a keyboard (MacBook Air) Oh yes, and of course AirPods too! Innovation looks different than constantly just varying the same theme.

Wall Street heavyweight JPMorgan (JPM) initiated coverage of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) with an underweight rating and an underwhelming $80 price target. The shares were trading 4.5% higher at around $189 at publication time. Circle is well positioned, the bank said, and its USDC stablecoin has an "early-mover advantage," with growing use cases in payments. "We think highly of the Circle management team and are confident in the outlook for outsized stablecoin and USDC growth," analysts led by Kenneth Worthington wrote. Still, the analysts see the company's market capitalization as elevated, and initiated coverage with an underweight rating. The stock priced at $31 a share in its initial public offering (IPO), and hit a record high of $299 last Monday. Other Wall Street analysts were not as bearish. Broker Bernstein initiated coverage with an outperform rating and a $230 price target, saying Circle was an "investor must-hold." "CRCL is building a market-leading digital dollar stablecoin network, with a strong regulatory edge, liquidity headstart and marquee distribution partnerships," analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. Bernstein is also bullish about the wider stablecoin market, and expects total market cap to reach around $4 trillion in the next decade from $225 billion today. Rival broker Canaccord Genuity started coverage of Circle with a buy rating and a $247 price target. The firm's analysts view the issuer of USDC as "having many of the key attributes that could make it a long-term winner in this potentially very large and new market for truly digital money."

New, rapid, and accessible approaches to bacterial detection are necessary to help curb the rising impacts of antimicrobial resistance. In this study, we introduce a technique that distinguishes bacteria through their unique surface interactions. By measuring and combining the interaction strengths of a bacterium across a set of chemically defined surfaces, we produced a novel bacterial identifier termed the surface interaction profile (SIP). The interaction strengths of twelve test bacteria across three discrete polyelectrolyte multilayer films (PEMs) were measured, facilitated by introducing each bacterial suspension to individual PEMs in microfluidic channels over a 10-minute interaction period and rinsing to remove bulk and loosely bound bacteria. The remaining surface-bound cells were counted via microscopy and plotted against suspension concentrations to build attachment curves whose slopes were measured as the strength of interaction for a given bacteria-PEM combination. These slopes were collected, per bacterial type, to produce each SIP. SIPs were capable of distinguishing between our pathogenic strains (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus) by Gram stain and individual species, and each blind test pathogen was successfully identified through SIP comparison. Furthermore, SIPs were also successful at differentiating between select Staphylococcus aureus walKR mutants impacting cell wall metabolism and high-risk antibiotic resistance mutants (MRSA and VISA), highlighting the utility and future diagnostic potential of this technique.

In principle, improving the turnaround time for bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) enables doctors to quickly prescribe effective antibiotics, improving patient outcomes while reducing the overuse and misuse of antibiotics that contribute to the further breeding of resistance [1,2]. In practice, traditional approaches (e.g., culture-based, phenotypic, turbidimetric) and improved or emerging rapid techniques (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests, mass spectrometry, enhanced turbidity) are either significantly time-consuming or resource-intensive [3]. Furthermore, emerging technologies are limited in their routine use and implementation in low-resource settings due to significant cost and operational barriers [4,5]. A chorus of risk factors, including limited access to clean water and sanitation, poor infection control practices in healthcare facilities, and a lack of antibiotic stewardship, increase the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant infections, associated mortality rates and healthcare costs in developing countries [6,7]. Continued progress toward new, rapid, and accessible approaches to pathogen detection is necessary to curb the global impact of AMR by improving diagnostics and infection surveillance practices beyond our borders. This study introduces a novel technique that differentiates bacteria based on their surface interactions, with the aim of developing a more rapid and less resource-intensive bacterial diagnostic. Variability in bacterial surface composition is observed across classes of bacteria, from broader differences between Gram stain and species to more subtle differences between strains and individual mutants, which impact the expression of virulence factors and/or antibiotic resistance [8–13]. Their unique surface composition and chemistry directly influence how they interact with surfaces [14,15], including those in their natural environments. The early stages of attachment are facilitated predominantly by electrostatics and, to a lesser extent, van der Waals forces and hydrophobic interactions [16–18]. In this context, the bacterial surface becomes a viable, versatile target for detection, offering a broad spectrum of potential surface interactions that can be utilized to differentiate between a wide array of bacteria. The attachment of bacterium A and B to an identical substrate C may not yield a measurable difference in their interaction strengths to differentiate them, primarily due to the small pool of possible interactions available when using a single substrate as a probe. Increasing the number and chemical diversity of substrates for which interaction strengths are measured enhances the capacity and complexity of potential interactions used to differentiate. In principle, this would allow for more nuanced variations in surface composition to be detectable, improving the probability of distinguishing bacterium A from B while also expanding the potential utility beyond species- or strain-level identification. By integrating interaction strengths across multiple chemically distinct surfaces we generate a unique bacterial identifier, the surface interaction profile (SIP) (Fig 1), designed to differentiate bacteria by direct comparison and to identify a clinical pathogen causing infection through comparison across a library of pre-measured SIPs. a, A schematic depicting the SIP, a novel bacterial identifier produced by combining interaction strengths between a given bacterium and a series of chemically unique surfaces. b, An illustration of a polyelectrolyte multilayer film assembled via the layer-by-layer approach. c-e, The chemical structures of polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA), polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), and polyethylenamine (PEI). f, A schematic of six test PEM surfaces (grey circles) encased in microfluidic channels (squares) in a polystyrene Petri dish. g, The protocol for bacterial-surface interactions: (1) pre-soaking PEM with PBS buffer (30 min), (2) introducing bacterial suspensions to each channel, (3) leaving them in contact for 10 minutes, and (4) rinsing channels with PBS. a, A schematic depicting the SIP, a novel bacterial identifier produced by combining interaction strengths between a given bacterium and a series of chemically unique surfaces. b, An illustration of a polyelectrolyte multilayer film assembled via the layer-by-layer approach. c-e, The chemical structures of polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA), polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), and polyethylenamine (PEI). f, A schematic of six test PEM surfaces (grey circles) encased in microfluidic channels (squares) in a polystyrene Petri dish. g, The protocol for bacterial-surface interactions: (1) pre-soaking PEM with PBS buffer (30 min), (2) introducing bacterial suspensions to each channel, (3) leaving them in contact for 10 minutes, and (4) rinsing channels with PBS. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0327489.g001 To test the distinguishing power of SIPs, we quantified the surface interaction strengths of twelve test bacteria across three discrete, chemically distinct polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films (Fig 1b) topped with the following positive- and negative-charged polymers: poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) (Fig 1c), polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) (Fig 1d), and polyethylenimine (PEI) (Fig 1e). All PEMs were encased in individual microfluidic channels (Fig 1f) and were exposed to four serially diluted bacterial suspensions (prepared via three biological replicates) through the following steps (Fig 1g): (1) pre-soaking the PEMs, (2) introducing bacterial suspensions to the channels, (3) leaving them in contact for 10 minutes, and (4) removing excess and loosely bound cells via rinsing. The remaining surface-attached bacteria were counted via optical microscopy and plotted against all suspension concentrations to build attachment curves (S1 Fig). Their slopes represented the interaction strength values for each bacterial-PEM combination and were collected (per bacterium) to produce each SIP (Fig 1g). A set of pathogens responsible for the majority of nosocomial infections [19] was tested to compare SIPs of bacteria broadly by Gram stain and individual species, including a blind experiment. This was followed by comparing SIPs across Staphylococcus aureus mutants affecting cell wall metabolism and antibiotic resistance (including single- and multi-drug-resistant mutants). The stock solutions (10 mg/mL) for polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) (Aldrich, 208.00 mg/mL, Mw 100,000–200,000), polyethylenimine (PEI) (Aldrich, 50% wt, Mw 750,000), and polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) (Aldrich, 344.13 mg/mL, Mw 200,000) polyelectrolytes were prepared by weight and dissolved in deionized (DI) water (pH 6.998, Millipore Milli-Q) with magnetic stirring. Three working polymer solutions (1 mg/mL) for each polymer type were prepared by diluting each respective stock (x10) with DI water and were sonicated (10 minutes) prior to use. Using a template (S3 Fig a), thirty-six small circles (1 cm diameter) were drawn across the interior of six Petri dish lids that formed the perimeter of each individual PEM surface. Three polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) type surfaces were prepared via the layer-by-layer approach with the following combinations of positive and negative polymer layers: PDDA/PSS (5.5 bilayer, positively charged PDDA-topped PEM), PDDA/PSS (5 bilayer, negatively charged PSS-topped PEM), and PEI/PSS (5.5 bilayer, positively charged PEI-topped PEM). To begin, a small aliquot (100 µL) of the positively charged polymer was added to each marked circle: PDDA (1 mg/mL) for PDDA- (N = 12) and PSS-topped (N = 12) PEMs, and PEI (1 mg/mL) for the PEI-topped PEM surfaces (N = 12). Once the positive polymer solution was added to each circle (N = 36), they were left to interact for 1 minute. After the interaction period, each individual surface was rinsed from top to bottom (unidirectional flow) in the order that the polymer was added (~2 seconds duration per surface) with a light stream of DI water: the rinsing protocol is detailed in S4 Fig. With a single Petri lid held at an approximately 35˚ angle (a), three of six surfaces were rinsed individually from left to right (b) with the DI water waste collecting at the bottom lip of the lid. The lid was then rotated counterclockwise by 180˚ (c), maintaining its angled position and allowing the excess water to flow around the lid edge. The final three surfaces were rinsed from above in the same order (left to right) as above (d), and the accumulated DI water was subsequently poured out (e). The lids were then flipped upside down and firmly tapped eight times against three piled Kimwipes on the lab bench, removing excess DI water without contacting the PEMs (f). This process was repeated for all remaining surfaces. A small aliquot (100 µL) of PSS (1 mg/mL) was then added to all 36 surfaces in sequence and left to incubate for 1 minute. The same rinsing protocol (above) was used post-incubation. This cycle of polymer addition and rinsing was repeated a total of 9 times for the (+) PEMs and 8 times for the (-) PEMs. The polymer incubation period for the last two layers of each PEM type (layers 10 and 11 of the (+) PEMs and layers 9 and 10 for the (-) PEMs) were left to incubate for 5 minutes. After the final rinsing step, when all polyelectrolyte layers had been added, the surfaces were left to dry with the lids ajar. Four strips of double-sided tape (1/2 in. double-sided polyester film tape, Tesa) were cut (6 cm long), and one strip (i) was added between two of three PEM surfaces in each row (S3 Fig b). On either side of the first strip of tape, two more strips (ii and iii) were added parallel to the first at 0.7 cm on either side. Finally, the last strip (iv) was added with the same 0.7 cm spacing to the left of strip iii. This was repeated for all six Petri dish lids. Next, the top plastic layer of each strip of tape was carefully removed using a tweezer. Each PEM surface was topped with a thin glass coverslip (1.5x1.5 cm, VWR), where the PEM was positioned at the center, and the coverslip edges contacted the double-sided tape strips on either side (S3 Fig b). Pressure was applied by hand at all points of contact between the cover slip and tape. All chip inlets and the inlet-facing edge of all coverslips had hydrophobic boundaries drawn on via a black permanent marker (S3 c). Bacteria were first prepared by inoculating the strain of interest and incubating it overnight with shaking (220 RPM) at 37˚C in LB. Bacteria were sub-cultured the next day at 1:1000 into fresh LB and incubated with shaking at 37˚C for 4–6 hours to the desired optical densities measured at 600 nm (OD600). The specific species, strains, mutants, and OD600 measurements pre- and post-resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) can be found in S1 Table. All test bacteria were laboratory stock, and all Staphylococcus aureus walKR mutants were sourced from a previous study [20]. S. aureus ATCC29213 walR EV and walR murOP were both grown in LB containing 12 µg/mL chloramphenicol, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) CA-USA300 ∆tarO-10 was grown in LB containing 300 µg/mL spectinomycin. Next, two 1 mL aliquots were transferred to individual Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 3 minutes to obtain a pellet for each strain. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended with 500 µL PBS. The 500 µL suspensions of two tubes from the same original culture were combined to produce a concentrated suspension (1 mL) each. The cells were rinsed two more times with PBS. Subsequently, all concentrated PBS suspensions were further serially diluted two-fold to produce four unique dilutions per suspension labelled C1-C4 from lowest to highest cell concentration. All bacteria were tested using three biological replicates, where each suspension was prepared from a single colony. All fluidic chips were arranged by PEM type in a biosafety cabinet with Petri covers removed. Groups of three PEMs in a row were marked C1-C4, covering all cell suspension concentrations per PEM type (N = 3 replicates per concentration per PEM type). The steps involved in the addition of a bacterial suspension to a fluid lane are illustrated in S5 Fig. Once the same-day bacterial suspensions reached the desired range of optical densities, all 36 fluid lanes were pre-wet with 100 µL of PBS for 30 minutes (1). Post-wetting, excess PBS buffer was removed via Kimwipe contact at both the fluid lane inlets and outlets while preventing the removal of PBS from the fluid lane interiors. Aliquots (70 µL) of C1-C4 cell suspensions were pipetted onto the marked lane inlets (N = 36), one suspension per lane per PEM type in triplicates, and were wicked through in sequence via Kimwipes in contact with the lane outlet (2). The suspensions were left to interact for 10 minutes (3). Post-interaction, all lanes were rinsed with a 100 µL aliquot of PBS buffer in the sequence that the suspensions were wicked through initially (4). This step was repeated for a total of 200 µL PBS wicked through using a fresh Kimwipe per lane. With all lanes rinsed, each PEM surface (N = 36) was imaged 10 times per surface (N = 360 total images per type of bacterium) using an inverted microscope (S5 Fig). All images were taken at 200x magnification, and the positions along each surface were selected randomly (S6 Fig). Areas containing large pieces of dust or debris were avoided. All images were batch processed in ImageJ (open source) to count the surface-bound cells: the left and right edges were cropped out, followed by applying the Find Maxima function (15 prominence, excluding edge cases) to extract cell counts. The batch processing macros code is as follows: makeRectangle(503, 1, 925, 1079); run(“Crop”); run(“Find Maxima...”, “prominence=15 exclude output=Count”); The mean cell counts across replicates per added bacterial suspension concentration (OD600) were plotted to produce attachment curves (mean ± SEM) per PEM type per bacterium (S2 Fig). All cell counts across all replicates were plotted per added bacterial suspension concentration (OD600) and a linear regression was applied. The interaction strength values (slope values) per bacterial-PEM combination were collected per bacterial type to produce each bacteria-specific SIP. Polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films were selected as the probe substrates in this study due to their simple and highly reproducible fabrication process, the layer-by-layer assembly (Fig 1b), which yields robust thin films with easily adjustable surface properties [21]. The PEM surface properties (e.g. charge, hydrophobicity, roughness) are determined by the deposition conditions (e.g. pH, ionic strength) and the polymer type, primarily in the topmost exposed layer [22,23]. Each individual PEM offers a variety of interactions from the charged (positive or negative), uncharged, hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties present in the polymers used, expanding the pool of interactions needed while maintaining a small number of probing substrates. The individual polymer layers are deposited under equilibrium conditions, such that while they are structurally amorphous, the distribution of these distinct chemical features is reproducibly uniform. All fabricated PEMs used in this study were pre-wet with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for 30 minutes to allow them time to reconfigure through polymer relaxation and to prevent this process from impacting the bacterial-PEM interactions. Bacteria were introduced as liquid suspensions in PBS to ensure that they remained viable throughout the duration of each experiment. The suspensions were introduced to each PEM through individual microfluidic channels (Fig 1f) that were designed to limit variability in fluid flow rate and direction. Shear stress caused by fluid flow can significantly impact bacterial attachment [24], requiring consistent control over the hydrodynamics of our channels. The SIPs of all test bacteria were plotted as a heat map (Fig 2a), highlighting distinct differences in the relative magnitudes of their interaction strengths across each PEM. While grouping the pathogen SIPs by Gram stain (Fig 2b), we observed the Gram-negative bacteria as having a stronger attachment preference for PEI while the Gram-positive bacteria preferred PSS. This was unsurprising, given that these two classes represent broad differences in bacterial envelope structure and surface chemistry, including polymer layers that encompass the cell. They comprise lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in Gram-negatives and teichoic acids (TA) in Gram-positives, both of which play an important factor in surface attachment [8]. For example, TAs were reported to be significant for attachment to plastics and glass found on biomedical devices [16]. Coincidentally, removing TAs in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) through a tarO deletion produced SIPs with reduced attachment strengths across all PEMs compared to the wild type (WT) (Fig 2c). a, The interaction strengths of all twelve test bacteria plotted as a heatmap for SIP comparison. b, The SIPs organized by Gram stain (mean ± SEM). c-f, All SIPs across S. aureus mutants (mean ± SEM). a, The interaction strengths of all twelve test bacteria plotted as a heatmap for SIP comparison. b, The SIPs organized by Gram stain (mean ± SEM). c-f, All SIPs across S. aureus mutants (mean ± SEM). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0327489.g002 SIPs continued to be distinguishable at the species level among the clinically significant pathogens (Fig 2a), with differentiating factors including the average magnitude of interaction strengths across PEMs (average SIP), and the variance of interaction strengths across PEMs (SIP spread). Notably, among these strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed the highest average SIP, and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) had the smallest SIP spread. Isolating the exact differences in bacterial surface features that produced the observed shifts in SIP is non-trivial and beyond the scope of this initial study. However, experimental clues suggest that differences in SIPs may not be limited to surface chemistry alone. Within the Gram-negative pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed significantly higher interaction strengths across all PEMs (Fig 1i) and is unique in its expression of flagella. These hairlike appendages confer swimming motility and increase the probability of surface encounters in P. aeruginosa [25,26], likely contributing to its increased average SIP. Examining other surface features and the genes that control them may be as simple as tracking changes in SIP between a set of mutants and their WT. To investigate further, we compared SIPs of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in S. aureus with single-point mutations in the wal operon, a key regulator of the autolysin-encoding genes in cell wall metabolism [27]. The first case study was S. aureus with a single-point mutation in walR, which reduced peptidoglycan recycling and increased the cell wall thickness [20]. This was followed by a subsequent single-point mutation in walK that restored cell wall metabolism and thickness back to approximately WT levels [20]. The walR SIP (Fig 2d) displayed a notable decrease in interaction strength for PEI and PSS and a comparable increase for PDDA, amounting to an overall drop in average SIP compared with the WT. The walK SIP reverted to an approximate WT SIP while preserving the order of PDDA and PEI preference from walR. In our second case study, cell wall thickness was reverted instead by adding the mupGmurQmurP operon encoded on a plasmid (Fig 2e), in effect corroborating the restoration of cell wall metabolism by producing a SIP similar to that of walK. Mutations in the walKR system have been linked to multidrug-resistant pathways in S. aureus [28]. Reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, a last-line antibiotic used to treat serious MRSA infections [29], is primarily associated with modifications to the cell wall peptide sequence that reduce the binding affinity and action of vancomycin [30]. However, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) isolates have also displayed thicker cell walls analogous to the walR mutant [12]. Coincidentally, the shifts in SIP from MRSA to VISA (Fig 1m) showed a decrease in average SIP and SIP spread, with drops in PEI and PSS interaction strengths similar to those observed in walR (Fig 1k). The more subtle shift in SIP from WT to MRSA (Fig 1m) was not unexpected as the action of methicillin resistance is mainly internal to the cell [31], though minor shifts in wall TA glycosylation have been observed [13]. Very subtle modifications like these could be detectable by improving SIP specificity through an increase in the number and diversity of test surfaces used to provide additional interactions. Regardless, both MRSA and VISA present serious risk factors in clinical settings [32,33] and being able to quickly distinguish between them (and possibly other resistant mutants) in tandem with bacterial identification presents an unignorable clinical potential for SIPs. In principle, we could determine the identity of an unknown pathogen by matching its SIP to one in a library of pre-measured SIPs. This library would be generated and continuously updated by measuring and compiling the SIPs of all current and new clinically relevant bacterial pathogens and antibiotic-resistant mutants using an optimized protocol developed for a future SIP-based diagnostic. To explore further, three test pathogens were randomly selected, their suspensions prepared blind, and their SIPs measured. We were able to successfully identify each blind test pathogen by comparing and matching SIPs (Fig 3a): i) Enterococcus faecalis, ii) Acinetobacter baumannii, and iii) Klebsiella pneumoniae. The attachment curves and interaction strength values between the blind test pathogens and their correctly identified clinically relevant strain counterparts displayed significant agreement across PEMs (Fig 3b) and were the highest percent matching pairs among all possible SIPs (S2 Table). a, All clinically significant pathogen and blind test pathogen SIPs are plotted as a heat map. b, The bacterial-surface attachment curves (surface-adhered cell counts plotted against suspension optical densities) of blind pathogens i, ii, and iii compared with their correctly identified counterparts E. faecalis, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae, respectively (mean ± SEM). a, All clinically significant pathogen and blind test pathogen SIPs are plotted as a heat map. b, The bacterial-surface attachment curves (surface-adhered cell counts plotted against suspension optical densities) of blind pathogens i, ii, and iii compared with their correctly identified counterparts E. faecalis, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae, respectively (mean ± SEM). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0327489.g003 Herein, we introduced a novel technique capable of rapidly differentiating a set of bacteria through their surface interactions, utilizing a quick 10-minute interaction period and only three probing surfaces. By comparing our first-generation SIPs, we were able to successfully distinguish between clinically significant pathogens from Gram stain to individual species. Furthermore, we confirmed the restoration of cell wall metabolism via tracking and comparing SIPs between a series of S. aureus mutants in the walKR system, broadening the scope and utility of this technique. Lastly, an early glance at its predictive capabilities combined with distinguishing single- and multidrug-resistant forms of S. aureus underscored its clinical relevance and future diagnostic potential in combining pathogen identification and AST under a single, rapid, low-cost test.

Title: Moonwell’s Founder Calls for Better Crypto UX: “Take the Hippocratic Oath to Your Users” | HackerNoon

Time Published: 2025-06-30T13:12:37Z
Full Content:
One of web3’s biggest challenges today is designing for people who don’t already speak its language, so I was excited to sit down with Luke Youngblood to explore what it takes to build systems that reach beyond the crypto bubble. From AWS to Coinbase and now leading Moonwell, Luke brings deep infrastructure expertise and a sharp focus on making blockchain easier, safer, and more accessible. In the early days of crypto, most people accessed it from a desktop computer on a fast internet connection. If you were early to Bitcoin or Ethereum, you were probably a developer like me—or a gamer—using it on your gaming PC. Either way, at that time, you needed some serious hardware and bandwidth just to run a wallet or interact with DeFi apps. In the last few years, decentralized finance (DeFi) apps have become usable on mobile web. That brought us a step closer to real accessibility; today, you can use most apps on chains like Ethereum or Base directly from your phone in a browser like Safari or Chrome. The next step, and one we’re already starting to see, is the use of native mobile apps. Zora, for example, now has an iOS app on Base. It’s a social and creative platform, and moving to native mobile is a big leap. That’s likely the direction we’ll take with Moonwell, too: building a great native experience on both iOS and Android. Of course, there are still other barriers to adoption—and language is a big one. Most early crypto apps simply assumed users spoke English. That might work in parts of the Americas or Europe, but it doesn’t hold in much of Latin America, Africa, or Asia, where English often isn’t the primary language. That’s why we’ve translated Moonwell into four additional languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, and Chinese. We have to keep making web3 more accessible, not just in terms of devices and apps, but in terms of language and context, too. Reaching beyond the small percentage of people who speak English as a second language is key to global adoption. At the core of an open financial system is self-custody. People should be able to own and control their assets directly—without relying on a third party. That’s always been important to early crypto users like me: being able to hold your own tokens and actually use them. The fundamentals are simple: freedom to custody and freedom to transact. What’s not simple, though, is onboarding the next billion in a way that makes those freedoms real. First come, wallets. If you’ve ever installed one, you know how painful it can be. App store, endless options, weird UX, seed phrase anxiety… For someone new to crypto, it’s a maze. That whole flow needs to go. We think passkey wallets are the answer; they’re built into most phones, secured by biometrics like Face ID, and don’t require downloading anything or managing a seed phrase. Telling someone to store twelve or twenty-four recovery words in a drawer and hope they never lose them really isn’t the way. Passkeys solve this, too. They back up automatically to iCloud or Google Cloud, so if you lose your phone, you can recover your wallet without panic or paperwork. Most people don’t use password managers—another problem—but at least modern browsers and OSs are making that easier. Still, access to the latest hardware isn’t universal. That’s a gap we can’t ignore. And then there’s transaction fees. Most onchain apps still expect users to buy ETH just to make a transaction, which adds unnecessary friction. At Moonwell, we solve this with Paymasters and sponsored transactions. First-time users can create a passkey wallet, enable cloud backup, and start using the app without ever buying ETH or worrying about fees. On Base, we use credits from Coinbase’s Gasless campaign to cover costs; on other networks, we sponsor transactions with USDC. The cost is low—just twenty dollars can cover thousands of transactions, making it easier for users to get started and for developers to scale. This way, we can onboard people without having to ask them to pay just to try an app—and it changes everything! Think about web2 apps like Instagram. It just works, it’s free. You never think about paying to post a photo. DeFi needs to feel that simple, too, if we want people to actually use it. One of the things I’ve noticed—after using the internet for decades since I was a kid—is how much it has evolved when it comes to networks. Back in the early days, if you wanted to connect with someone online, you had to think about which network you were on. I remember using university networks and dial-up bulletin board systems. You couldn’t just go anywhere; you had to log into a specific system to reach specific people. Everything was its own little walled garden. And honestly, that’s how crypto feels today. Ethereum, Base, other layer 1s, and layer 2s—there are bridges between them, but using apps across chains is still a hassle. If your wallet is connected to one network, you can’t easily interact with an app on another. You always have to think about where your tokens are and how to move them. So at Moonwell, we’ve been trying to solve this. We built a feature called Beam, already live in its early version, to make cross-chain UX feel like single-chain UX. Beam shows your total balance across chains—if you’ve got $50 on one chain, $25 on another, and $25 elsewhere, we just show you $100. When you hit “deposit” and sign the transaction, Beam gathers your tokens, bridges them if needed, and deposits them—all behind the scenes. To do that, we use a modular execution environment that picks the fastest and most cost-effective route. In many cases, that’s Across Protocol, which is great for bridging efficiently. The user stays in control the whole time—they’re still signing the transaction—but the complexity is abstracted away. It’s both faster and cheaper. Even when bridging from Ethereum mainnet, the process takes just a few minutes. We bundle transactions using an intents-based system, so your share of the gas might only be a penny or two. It's not like those big onchain operations that cost $15 or more. Under the hood, it's complex, but to the user, it feels simple and seamless. Too much of web3 expects users to think about the underlying infrastructure. What chain they are on, how to bridge assets, or whether an app is even compatible with their wallet. That’s not a good user experience—it’s just extra friction. The “Switch Network” prompt you see in many wallets is a great example. It’s really one of the clearest signs we haven’t abstracted the complexity away. If you look at messaging, be it via SMS or WhatsApp, you send a text, and it delivers. You’re not wondering what carrier the other person uses—it’s invisible to you. That’s what people expect from software. Web3 should be no different. Users shouldn’t be blocked from an app just because it runs on a different chain. With Beam, we’re pushing infrastructure into the background, where it belongs. My hope is that in a few years, no one will care whether they’re on Ethereum, Solana, Base, or BNB Chain. They’ll just open the app—whether it’s Moonwell, a game on Sonium, or something on World Chain—and it’ll just work. Before I went full-time into crypto, I worked in web2 tech—at Amazon Web Services (AWS). And in many ways, the adoption of cloud services mirrors what’s happening now with web3. In the early days, most companies didn’t take the cloud seriously. If you worked in tech back then, you were probably dealing with massive data centers and centralized systems like Oracle. When AWS launched EC2—the Elastic Compute Cloud—in the 2000s, big enterprises saw it as a toy. Something for startups or hobbyists, not real infrastructure. But now, most of the largest businesses in the world use cloud as their default. It’s faster, cheaper, and more flexible because you only pay for what you use. That’s very similar to what’s happening with web3 and financial apps today. Legacy banking infrastructure often takes days to settle transactions, while web3 enables instant cross-border settlements. We’re upgrading the financial system much like engineers upgraded from on-prem data centers to cloud services in the 2010s. By adopting new financial infrastructure—smart contracts and web3—banks, fintechs, and traditional finance companies will be able to offer far better services. Much of this will be powered by protocols like Moonwell, because we’ve spent years building decentralized infrastructure that’s self-custodial, permissionless, and gives people real control over their money. The GENIUS Act recently passed the U.S. Senate, marking the first step toward allowing banks to hold stablecoins on their balance sheets. It still needs to pass the House and be signed by the President, but if it does, the “crypto economy” may soon just be “the economy. Big banks—like Bank of America, Santander in Latin America, and Brazil’s BTG Pactual—will want to integrate stablecoin infrastructure into their core products. That means instant cross-border settlements and cheaper remittances, which is a big deal for people in places like Colombia who currently wait days and pay high fees to services like MoneyGram to receive money from abroad. It’s exciting to see the traditional finance system upgrading to support onchain finance and stablecoins, just like the cloud transformed data centers and opened up new possibilities for services that didn’t exist before. That’s a tough question. Large traditional finance players will always want to centralize control because they want to protect their existing business models. Decentralization threatens that, so there’s a natural tension. Some of these centralized players will build private networks. For example, BlackRock has its BUIDL Fund on Ethereum and Base. It’s a tokenized fund that lets people invest in traditional financial assets. The fund is an ERC-20 token, but it’s permissioned—only licensed broker-dealers, ATS (Alternative Trading Systems), and other regulated market participants can hold it. So, there will be centralized assets—like tokenized stocks—that you can only interact with if you’re a bank, brokerage, or have passed KYB (Know Your Business) checks. However, I think decentralization and permissionless self-custody can still exist through intermediaries. For instance, if the BlackRock BUIDL Fund is only available to institutions, retail investors like me can’t buy it directly. But a bank or fintech could become a licensed participant, join the fund as an institution, and then offer retail banking services to customers like me. They’d do KYC on me, and then I could buy and transact with a wrapped version of the fund. But that’s just an example; you can imagine similar things for tokenized stocks—it would mean only US investors can hold them if they’ve completed KYC through a bank. This setup would look somewhat like the current financial system, but with benefits like instant settlement—you wouldn’t have to wait two days for stock certificates to clear. It’s much more efficient. A concrete example is loan origination. Instead of waiting days or weeks for human loan officers to review credit and approve loans, decentralized apps like Moonwell can originate thousands of loans in a single day automatically using smart contracts. So, as traditional finance adopts web3 tech, you’ll see huge efficiency gains. But ultimately, retail users will still be able to take the self-custodial route. I might buy a fraction of Nvidia stock and hold it in my own wallet—not through BlackRock or a big bank, but via something like E*TRADE or a retail-focused platform offering a faster, cheaper experience powered by blockchain. Put yourself in the user’s shoes. When I build onchain apps, I think of it like a Hippocratic oath. For doctors, that means avoiding harm to the patient. For us, it means protecting the user and their funds, no matter what. Of course, crypto has its share of hacks, so as builders, we must never release anything that isn’t audited, secure, and backed by a solid bug bounty. Malicious actors will always try to steal from your users, so protecting user funds has to be a top priority. The other piece is decentralization. Early on, it’s tempting to keep control centralized—you can move faster. But if your app grows to millions in value, you don’t want all control in one place or one person’s hands. It puts your team and users at risk, making you a target. It’s important to think early about moving control to a DAO or decentralized governance by token holders, and to distribute those tokens widely. Moonwell has over 100,000 WELL token holders who govern the protocol. That setup lets us upgrade contracts and add markets safely without centralized control. It builds resilience and helps us sleep better at night. Start by exploring. Moonwell’s a good place to learn how lending and borrowing work onchain. And if you’ve got questions along the way, Mamo’s there too—it’s a cute little AI companion we built to help people get more comfortable with the basics. The jump from curious to confident takes time, so start small and stay curious!

Title: Too Many Leaders Are In Denial About AI's Job Displacement Threat

ByMark Murphy ByMark Murphy, Senior Contributor. Too Many Leaders Are In Denial About AI's Job Displacement Threat There's been no shortage of news about recent workforce changes and even layoffs as a result of AI. Perhaps most famously, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a message to employees: "As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company." Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, speaking on a recent earnings call about AI, said, "But beyond that, all the way from the Finance team preparing for this earnings call, to everything, it’s deeply embedded in everything we do. But I still see it as early days, and there’s going to be a lot more to do." IBM has reportedly eliminated around 8,000 positions, including a large number in HR, while CEO Arvind Krishna noted that the company has been aggressively adopting AI and automation. Joining the list of notable companies with AI-related layoffs are Microsoft, Intel, Meta, CrowdStrike, Salesforce, Dell, and more. Now, technology companies are, not surprisingly, the ones making headlines, but the impact of AI is being felt far beyond the tech industry. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, an AI powerhouse, recently told Axios that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years. Aneesh Raman, chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, recently wrote that "While the technology sector is feeling the first waves of change, reflecting A.I.'s mass adoption in this field, the erosion of traditional entry-level tasks is expected to play out in fields like finance, travel, food and professional services, too." But here's where the story takes a troubling turn. While CEOs and industry leaders are publicly acknowledging AI's transformative impact on employment, a comprehensive new study from Leadership IQ reveals that the vast majority of business leaders may be living in denial about what's actually coming. The AI Readiness 2025 study, which surveyed 1,251 executives, directors, and managers across diverse industries, uncovered a striking paradox that should alarm anyone concerned about organizational preparedness. Despite nearly 80% of business leaders now personally using AI tools—a dramatic surge from just two years ago—a staggering 56.4% either don't expect AI to replace employees in their organizations over the next three years or remain completely uncertain about it. Let that sink in for a moment. More than half of the decision-makers responsible for steering organizations through the AI revolution either don't see job displacement coming or have no idea whether it's coming at all. AI Readiness 2025 Study The breakdown is even more revealing: 35.9% of leaders flatly don't believe AI will replace employees, while another 20.5% simply don't know. Only 43.6% acknowledge that AI will likely lead to job displacement, with just 12.8% expecting a "significant number" of replacements and 30.8% anticipating a "small number." What makes these findings particularly concerning is their consistency with our 2023 baseline study. Despite nearly three years of unprecedented AI development since ChatGPT's launch, despite the public statements from tech CEOs about workforce reductions, and despite widespread personal experience with AI tools, leadership attitudes about AI's employment impact have remained remarkably static. This isn't simply a case of cautious optimism—it's a potentially dangerous case of what researchers call "optimism bias," where decision-makers systematically underestimate the likelihood and severity of negative outcomes. When Andy Jassy tells his employees that Amazon will "need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today," but 56% of business leaders don't expect job displacement in their own organizations, we have a fundamental disconnect between industry reality and leadership perception. The implications are staggering. If the majority of business leaders are unprepared for AI-driven workforce changes, their organizations will be caught flat-footed when those changes accelerate. Employees will receive inadequate warning and retraining opportunities. Strategic planning will be based on flawed assumptions. And companies may find themselves scrambling to adapt when competitors who took AI's impact seriously begin to pull ahead with leaner, more AI-integrated operations. Perhaps most telling is that this skepticism extends to leaders' views of their own roles. Despite using AI tools daily and seeing their capabilities firsthand, 46% of business leaders either don't believe AI will impact their own jobs or remain uncertain about it. This personal blind spot may be fueling the broader organizational denial. It's a classic case of "it won't happen to me" thinking, amplified across entire leadership teams. If executives can't acknowledge that AI might transform their own roles—roles that often involve strategic thinking, analysis, and decision-making that AI is increasingly capable of supporting or even replacing—how can they realistically assess the impact on their organizations? This leadership disconnect creates a "preparation crisis." While AI capabilities continue expanding at breakneck speed, the majority of organizations may be operating under the assumption that significant workforce disruption isn't coming—or at least isn't coming soon. The contrast with forward-thinking leaders couldn't be starker. When Dario Amodei warns that AI could eliminate half of entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment to 10-20% within five years, he's not speaking hypothetically. Anthropic is at the forefront of AI development, and their CEO has a front-row seat to what's coming next. Yet our study suggests that most business leaders either haven't internalized these warnings or don't believe they apply to their organizations. This isn't just concerning—it's potentially catastrophic for organizational competitiveness and employee welfare. Despite these concerns, there is a glimmer of hope. A recent PwC report found that workers with AI skills command a 56% wage premium. And given how few people have advanced AI skills, it's really not that hard to elevate your AI skillset quickly and stand out from everyone else. As Amazon's CEO put it in his memo, "Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company."

Title: GoFundMe launches new funds aimed at maximizing charitable donations

Alicia Adamczyk is a New York City-based senior writer at Fortune, covering personal finance, investing, and retirement. Nina Ajemian is the newsletter curation fellow at Fortune and works on the Term Sheet and MPW Daily newsletters. – Funding the future. Even when they are not the breadwinners, women tend to make many of their households’ financial decisions, including charitable giving. And with the impending great wealth transfer, in which women in particular are expected to inherit trillions upon trillions of dollars, that could have profound effects on charitable giving throughout the country in the near future. That’s according to Margaret Richardson, GoFundMe’s chief marketing and corporate affairs officer, who I talked to last week about women and philanthropy and the company’s newest product launch. According to Richardson, women are busier than ever. And while they can and have managed many of these household tasks, many are also looking for ways to make managing their finances more seamless. “Women are often the charitable decision makers already in their families, and we see that that trend just continuing as women have more resources and more responsibilities,” says Richardson. That is one of the reasons GoFundMe is launching its newest product today, one it hopes will make charitable giving easier and more impactful—and attract some of those trillions. Called Giving Funds, it is a type of donor-advised fund that will allow users to contribute to the charitable investment accounts right on GoFundMe’s site. Donor-advised funds, or DAFs, are growing in popularity, as I wrote last year. They are tax-advantaged accounts for charitable giving, in which lump sum or automated recurring contributions can be invested; eventually the contributions and gains will go to charity, and they grow tax-free. It can be helpful to think of DAFs as similar to a 401(k), health savings account, or 529 account. Money contributed to a DAF cannot be taken back, it is effectively a charitable contribution and donors are generally eligible to take an immediate tax deduction. The benefit is that you can donate now, get that tax deduction now (if you itemize), invest the funds, and then have more to give in the future. GoFundMe is partnering with fund managers like BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors, and Vanguard to advise on the investment options, which are a number of exchange-traded funds. Though plenty of financial institutions offer DAFs, Richardson says the benefit of doing it on GoFundMe is that users will have all of their charitable giving centralized, and receive one annual tax document. There are no management fees and no minimum balances, and users can give their funds to any of the 1.4 million charities on the platform. Despite their tax benefits, DAFs are still fairly niche products—only about 1% of Americans use them, says Richardson, though an increasingly larger share of the U.S.’s total annual charitable contributions stem from them with each passing year. But a site like GoFundMe offering them could be the start to broadening their appeal—after all, the site has some 200 million users from all income levels, races, and genders. It could be many peoples’ first exposure to the investment tool. And, she says, it makes it easier for people to plan ahead. Many users come to GoFundMe after a natural disaster or other event to find causes to donate to. If they already have a pot of money waiting there that they previously donated—and that has possibly grown as it was invested—it can make all of their charitable giving more seamless. “This could be a really efficient and effective way for people to…get [funds] out the door quickly when organizations need it most,” she says.

A reversal in disability benefits from the U.K.’s prime minister has eliminated £3 billion ($4.1 billion) in savings, leaving chancellor Rachel Reeves with the question: Where is she going to find the funds to stay on track in meeting her budget rules? Bloomberg - Regional relocations. Following the protests in Los Angeles over ICE raids, Kelly Loeffler’s Small Business Administration (SBA) is moving some of its offices out of “sanctuary cities.” Losing these regional offices could have a real impact on the over 1.3 million small businesses in L.A., as founders will now have to travel to other offices for SBA services. Inc. - Large losses. Since Roe was overturned in 2022, the U.S. has sustained $133 billion in economic losses annually, says a new analysis from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. Plus, abortion restrictions have kept over half a million women out of the workforce annually; Black and Latina women have been impacted the most here. Mother Jones - Targeting tennis. Gambling companies are being called on by tennis authorities to close users’ accounts if they have sent abusive messages to female tennis players.

Giving Funds is GoFundMe’s latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered NEW YORK -- GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan had some complications while fundraising on his own website last fall. Several friends wanted to help Cadogan reach his $28,000 goal as he crowdfunded for a Los Angeles area wilderness rescue team. But they tried to donate through a lesser-known wealth management tool called a donor-advised fund, or a DAF, a no-frills investing vehicle for money earmarked as eventual charitable gifts. After cutting checks and waiting three weeks, Cadogan said, the money finally arrived. “It was just a bit of a thing,” he added. "If they were using a Giving Fund, it would take ten seconds.” Giving Funds are GoFundMe's latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered. But the for-profit company's DAF, announced Monday, enters a crowded market of more than a thousand providers — products often with older, wealthier clienteles that are often criticized for warehousing gifts. To transform the way that everyday users plan their donations, Cadogan will have to widen the appeal of DAFs beyond the likes of the technology entrepreneur's circles. And he wants to change public perceptions of his company as just a crowdfunding site. “We’re also hopeful that more people will start using GoFundMe for a broader set of things in their lives: not just that one fundraiser they’re supporting, not just that one nonprofit. But they’re coming in and they’re managing their giving portfolio with us and through us,” Cadogan said. “That connects directly to our mission, which is we want to help people help each other.” Donor-advised funds grew popular over the last decade among ultra-high net worth individuals as a tax-efficient instrument for grantmaking without the hassle of a more sophisticated charitable foundation. Donors can immediately write the contribution off on their taxes but face no deadline for giving the money to a nonprofit. The idea: account holders could invest money they wanted to ultimately donate, let the funds grow tax-free while they sit and give themselves time to identify the recipients best aligned with their giving goals. There's since been a rush to court average givers. Legacy financial services firms such as Fidelity Charitable lowered the minimums to open accounts. Fintech startups such as Daffy contrast their flat fees with the hidden expenses they allege their competitors charge. All that traction brought IRS proposals last year to impose penalties on those who abuse DAFs and Congress has considered legislation that would require some deadlines for disbursements. GoFundMe's Giving Funds will have no minimum balances, zero management fees and donations starting at $5. Users can load their DAF through their bank accounts or direct deposits for free. Credit card payments will be covered through the end of the year and then face the company's standard transaction fee of 2.2% plus 30 cents. Contributions can then be invested in a choice of exchange traded funds from managers including Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors. Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving — something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn't occurred because DAFs have been framed as “wealth management products.” “This is a giving product,” Cadogan said. “It’s something for everybody. And you don’t need to know the words ‘donor advised fund.’ It doesn’t show up.” DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes — even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023. Cadogan believes GoFundMe's culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends' charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas. That “dynamic, alive community” is very different from the “fairly static, passive” financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan. “It’s essentially inspiring the money to move,” he said. Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning. Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative's recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the “sweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.” The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it's a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are “available-to-everyone vehicles" considering that half run balances under $50,000. “Givers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,” Williams said. “Anything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.” But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe's entrance as “a game changer” that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years. Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a “savings account" for "good works." “And GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,” she said. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have become a $3.4 trillion market this year as U.S. president Donald Trump helps drive the bitcoin price with a wild crypto prediction. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price is nearing its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, bouncing back from April lows of $75,000, with markets braced for a Federal Reserve flip. Now, as a legendary billionaire has said he expects global “de-dollarization" to catapult the bitcoin price higher, traders are eyeing what Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks has said will be a “big” July, while the Federal Reserve is under pressure to cut interest rates and unleash the “trillions and trillions” of dollars that are on the sidelines. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump's second term in the White House has helped the bitcoin price soar. "July will be a big month," Sacks posted to X, adding that he's expecting "a bill signing" for the stablecoin Genius Act, and the crypto market structure Clarity Act “going to the Senate.” "President Trump supports Clarity on market structure as well as Genius on stablecoins," Sacks posted. "Let’s get this done!" The Trump administration has fast-tracked crypto legislation, rushing to pass bills that would legitimise dollar-pegged stablecoins and carve up the bitcoin and crypto market between regulators after companies and developers complained for years they’ve been left in limbo. Earlier this month, the Senate passed the Genius Act that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, legitimizing their use for issuers and custodians. Trump said he expected the the Genius Act to lead to “massive” crypto investment once if it’s passed by the House of Representatives. Trump’s support of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more broadly has flourished since he returned to the White House in January. Last week, Trump said bitcoin is taking "a lot of pressure off the dollar, and it is a great thing for our country," during a press conference, adding bitcoin has “become amazing.” The U.S. dollar index, which measures its performance against six other major currencies, is on track for its biggest drop in the first six months of a year since the era of free-floating currencies began in the early 1970s.

More as a perfect storm of U.S. president Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve hits. Meanwhile, Powell, who Trump has repeatedly attacked for his commitment to holding interest rates steady even as inflation falls toward its 2% target, is under increasing pressure to lower rates. “Jerome Powell is in an increasingly untenable situation because he will be looked at as politicizing the office of the Federal Reserve,” investor Chamath Palihapitiya said during an episode of the All In Podcast, which he hosts alongside crypto czar David Sacks and fellow investors David Friedburn and Jason Calacanis. “Look at how much money is sitting in money market funds … you have trillions and trillions of dollars of dry powder on the sidelines that will need to find a home.” Bitcoin and crypto analysts are generally feeling upbeat about the market’s outlook as policy, macro and funding factors align. “The setup for bitcoin remains compelling,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments. “A clean break above $110,000 could trigger a fast move to $120,000—putting our $138,500 summer target within reach. With policy, macro, and flows aligning, bitcoin may be setting up for a bullish end to the year—where a push toward $200,000 is no longer just a long shot, but a growing probability."

The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq—as well as the bitcoin price and gold—have returned to all-time highs in the first six months of Donald Trump’s second stint in the White House (with traders now braced for a Federal Reserve earthquake). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price is almost double where it was a year ago amid serious fears over the fate of the U.S. dollar, while the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have all rebounded from their Trump tariff-induced slumps. Gold has almost doubled over last two years.

Bitcoin, along with stocks that make up the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq, all sold off sharply this year as investors balked at Trump’s plans for wide-ranging tariffs on countries around the world. Stock and crypto markets have bounced back, however, as fears Trump’s tariffs would immediately drive inflation higher failed to materialise, with the bitcoin price hitting an all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin earlier this month.

In early April, Trump posted to his Truth Social account that he thought it was a “great time to buy,” which proved to be the bitcoin price and stock market’s recent bottom. S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq are all at or near all-time highs, with the gold price dropping back from its recent peak as traders go “risk on” and buy bitcoin, crypto and stocks. “A stronger risk appetite suggests investors are fishing for opportunities in the U.S. again, despite signs earlier this year of a market rotation away from America in favour of allocating more money to Europe and emerging markets," Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said in emailed comments. "Admittedly, a month is too short a period to make a call on a definite trend, but it’s an area to watch closely.”

(“Credicorp” or “the Company”) (NYSE:BAP | BVL: BAP), the leading financial services holding company in Peru with a presence in Chile, Colombia, Bolivia, and Panama, through its subsidiary Grupo Credito S.A. initiates legal action against the Peruvian Tax Administration (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria – SUNAT), for disregarding the law and the decision of SUNAT´s Review Committee (Comité Revisor), whose rulings are binding under current legislation. The Company expresses concern that SUNAT is ignoring the legal framework in effect at the time of the transactions in question, thereby undermining legal certainty for companies operating in Peru. The transactions in question involved Grupo Crédito S.A. purchasing Banco de Crédito del Perú (BCP) shares from Credicorp Ltd. in 2018 and 2019, through the Lima Stock Exchange. At the time, Peruvian law exempted such transactions from income tax, provided that the transferred shares did not exceed 10% of the total outstanding shares of the issuing company within a 12-month period. These transactions were communicated to the Superintendencia del Mercado de Valores (SMV), approved by the Superintendencia de Banca, Seguros y AFP (SBS), and duly registered with Registro Central de Valores y Liquidaciones (CAVALI). They were conducted transparently and in full compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Credicorp notes that this case was previously reviewed by SUNAT’s own Review Committee, which confirmed the authenticity of the transactions and found no grounds for tax elusion claims. Nevertheless, SUNAT has reopened the matter and is now seeking over S/. 1.5 billion in purported unpaid income tax and accrued interest. Credicorp views this action as a serious breach of legal predictability, given it involves both the disregard of established legal norms, and the reopening of a case already assessed and resolved by SUNAT’s own Review Committee. In accordance with International Accounting Standards, no expense provisions are necessary. Credicorp is evaluating this new development and will respond through all appropriate legal and administrative channels. Grupo Crédito S.A., the entity involved, reaffirms its commitment to full regulatory and tax compliance, and to protecting the interests of its employees, clients, and investors.

Title: Click, speak, move: These brain implants are poised to help people with disabilities

Jon Hamilton Phillip McKenzie, who was paralyzed from the neck down in a fall in 2012, uses a brain-computer interface developed by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh to navigate complex virtual tasks that simulate everyday activities, UPMC and Pitt Health Sciences hide caption People who have lost the ability to move or speak may soon have a new option: surgically implanted devices that link the brain to a computer. More than two decades after researchers first demonstrated that a person could move a computer cursor with their thoughts, several firms are poised to take the brain-computer interface (BCI) from experimental curiosity to commercial product. "We know it works, we know the enabling technologies are now ready," says Michael Mager, the CEO of Precision Neuroscience. "It's time to turn this academic work into a thriving industry that can make a big impact on people's lives." Already, experimental brain-computer interfaces have been implanted in dozens of people. The latest devices go under the skin and can communicate wirelessly with a smartphone or tablet. Elon Musk's Neuralink is the most visible player in the BCI field. But the first product to reach the market may well come from competitors including Precision, Blackrock Neurotech, Paradromics, or Synchron. Some of these companies, like Blackrock, have much more experience than Neuralink. Others use less invasive, and potentially safer, technology that may make it easier to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration. The first BCI customers are likely to be people living with paralysis from a spinal injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Early products will allow them to control a computer cursor, or generate artificial speech. Implanted BCIs work by detecting and decoding signals coming from areas of the brain that control movement or speech. These signals indicate when a person is trying to move a limb or speak a word. A BCI system typically includes sensors that detect brain activity, an interface that processes the signals, and an external device that turns thought into action. The result: A cursor moves, a prosthetic hand reaches, a synthetic voice speaks the words a person is trying to articulate. "Imagine the joy of connecting with your loved ones, browsing the web, or even playing games using only your thoughts," says the narrator of a promotional video from Neuralink. The company, which did not respond to requests for an interview, calls this capability "telepathy." Neuralink pushed BCIs into the public imagination in early 2024, thanks to a charismatic and resilient man with paralysis. A diving accident left Noland Arbaugh unable to move from the shoulders down. At 29, he became the first person to get Neuralink's device. A robot threaded more than a thousand electrodes into his brain's motor cortex at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix. Then, human surgeons there installed a wireless interface about the size of a quarter in his skull. A few weeks later, Arbaugh was on stage at Neuralink's headquarters in Fremont, California, describing his experience controlling a computer cursor. "It's freakin' wild," he said. "When I first moved it just by thinking, it blew my mind for like a day. I just could not wrap my head around it." A video featuring Arbaugh's remarks has attracted more than 25 million views on Musk's social media platform, X. But the success was tempered by Neuralink's announcement a few weeks later that some of the threads of electrodes in Arbaugh's brain had "retracted," making the device less sensitive. Since then, Neuralink has reported implanting its BCI in at least six other people. But details about those experiments remain scant. While Neuralink's surgical robots and wireless electronics are new, using thoughts to move a cursor isn't. Dr. Leigh Hochberg — who holds positions at Brown University and Massachusetts General Hospital — was part of a team that pioneered the approach in 2004. Their subject was Matt Nagle, a man who was living with paralysis after being stabbed in the neck. Hochberg's team linked Nagle's brain to a computer using old-fashioned wires that passed through his skull. A research video from 2004 shows Nagle using his thoughts to open an email. "It was exactly what was supposed to happen," Hochberg says. "And even for all of us that were expecting it — there was a little bit of magic there." Nagle died in 2007 of an infection unrelated to the experiment. BrainGate evolved into an academic consortium directed by Hochberg. And in June 2025, a team at the University of California, Davis reported that a BrainGate 2 BCI allowed a man with ALS to speak through a computer. "I. Am. Good," the synthesized voice says in a video accompanying the study. The speech is slightly halting, spoken one word a time. But the voice sounds human — it was constructed from old audio of the man speaking. Experiments like that one show how computer interfaces have improved, Hochberg says. Instead of monitoring a few dozen neurons, they may listen to thousands. Instead of sending information out through wires, they use wireless protocols. And instead of interfacing with a wall of computers, the signals may go to a single laptop or tablet. Another big change is that scientists keep finding ways to decode brain activity "more accurately, more consistently and more reliably," Hochberg says. In the past few years, that has meant employing artificial intelligence to recognize the neural activity patterns that reveal a person's intention to speak, or pick up a bar of chocolate. The field has also become specialized, Hochberg says, with some groups focused on decoding speech while others work on improving control of robotic limbs. There are even groups "focused on putting information back into the brain," Hochberg says, which can add a sense of touch to a robotic arm or hand. The University of Pittsburgh is among the leaders in providing sensory feedback through a brain-computer interface. "You can't have fine and dextrous motor control with visual feedback alone," says Jennifer Collinger, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh. You need that sense of touch to be able to respond in a natural way." With touch feedback, the user can tell when an artificial finger makes contact with an object or when an artificial hand is holding a cup tightly enough to keep it from falling. So Collinger and her colleagues have been working with Blackrock Neurotech, whose brain interface technology has been used experimentally in dozens of people. One of those people is Nathan Copeland, who was paralyzed in a car accident. In 2016, Copeland famously used a robotic arm to bump fists with President Barack Obama. In 2021, Copeland was part of a study that showed how a sense of touch improved his ability to grasp and manipulate objects with his prosthetic hand. "With sensation, I could feel that the hand had made contact," Copeland said in a 2021 interview with NPR. "I could also tell if I had a firm grip on it or not." But advanced features like sensory feedback aren't going to appear in the first implanted devices on the market, Collinger says. Instead, they are likely to offer control of a computer cursor, much like BrainGate did in those lab experiments more than 20 years ago. "There's been enough consistent success that now companies are saying, 'Okay we can offer a first-generation device to people that will offer some kind of benefit to them,'" Collinger says. One of those companies is Precision Neuroscience, which was cofounded by Ben Rapoport, a neurosurgeon and engineer who had previously helped start Neuralink. Precision's other co-founder and CEO, Michael Mager, says the company's short-term goal is a wireless device that allows a person with paralysis to operate a smartphone or computer. "We think about accessing news and entertainment, we think about productivity software like Microsoft Office, Word, Powerpoint, Excel," Mager says. "If you can operate those programs as well as someone who is able-bodied, it's quality-of-life enhancing — and it's also potentially enabling for people to go back to work." Precision's device differs from Neuralink's because it doesn't insert its electrodes into the brain. "We have a very, very thin film that is designed to sit on the surface of the brain without penetrating into or damaging the brain," Mager says. That makes the implant safer and less invasive, Mager says, which could make it easier to get approval from the FDA. Synchron avoids opening the skull entirely. Its electrodes are delivered through blood vessels using technology designed to place stents in blocked arteries. All of these devices face some common challenges, Mager says. "We're sampling from thousands of electrodes, thousands of times a second, and the amount of data that comes off of these systems is just enormous," he says. It is far too much data to transmit through existing wireless links. So companies are working on ways to reduce or compress the data. Another obstacle is the cost to conduct the sort of clinical trials required by the FDA. That will probably be hundreds of millions of dollars, Mager says. Even so, Mager thinks his company and several others, including Neuralink, have the resources and expertise to turn the brain interface concept into a marketable product. That won't take another 20 years, he says. Perhaps another two or three. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Surging inflows catapult IBIT to fourth-largest US ETF with rapid AUM growth, outshining rivals. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is rapidly cementing its status as the most dominant BTC fund among its peers. Bitcoin analyst James Check highlighted the divergence in a June 29 X post, noting that total inflows across all other Bitcoin ETFs have stagnated around $20 billion since December 2024. In contrast, IBIT alone has drawn over $52 billion in cumulative inflows since its launch, solidifying its dominance in the space. He further pointed out that this trend is reflected in weekly inflow data, where IBIT attracts the lion’s share of new investments and shows minimal outflows compared to competitors. Check wrote: “Dominance for all other ETFs in terms of total AUM has been in constant decline, initially dominated by GTBTC outflows, but more recently due to a clear preference for IBIT by investors.” This matches data from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who noted that based on year-to-date inflows, IBIT now ranks as the fourth-largest ETF in the US. According to Balchunas’ data, IBIT has leapfrogged over SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG) and is closing in on heavyweights like Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI). As of June 23, IBIT had recorded $13.7 billion in inflows, which is ahead of SPLG’s $13.4 billion but below VTI’s $19.3 billion. He also highlighted IBIT’s outlier status, noting that the fund is “the fifth in three-year flows (despite only being alive for 1.5 years).” These inflows helped the fund cross $70 billion in assets under management (AUM) in just 341 trading days, the fastest rate for any US ETF. This breakout performance has translated into significant financial gains for BlackRock. Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, pointed out that IBIT generates $186 million annually in fee revenue, surpassing even IVV (BlackRock’s flagship S&P 500 ETF) by $3 million. According to Arkham Intelligence, this milestone is particularly noteworthy given that IVV is nearly ten times larger than IBIT in terms of assets under management. The shift signals a broader change in institutional behavior. BlackRock, long associated with traditional equity markets, is now seeing more fee revenue from its Bitcoin ETF than from legacy stock-based products. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Eurobike 2025: the Weird and the Wonderful

Eurobike 2025 swung open its doors to welcome the cycling industry into its new-as-of-a-few-years home in Frankfurt, where the usual assortment of weird and wonderful products awaited the eager eyes - and cameras - of the world's cycling media. Our intrepid trade show reporter Andi Sykes scoured the fairground halls for us in search of novel and newsworthy items, and this is what he came back with. Dive in! Stablead is a new name to the MTB scene. The company is better known for tripods and gimbals and hopes to bring some of their expertise in those fields to the MTB world. The bike Stablead had on display isn’t intended to be released but show off their manufacturing technologies and also display some of their products which include front and rear suspension, pedals, stems and more. This unnamed upside down fork will be released next year. It will be aimed at enduro riders with around 160-170mm of travel. The upper leg and steerer assembly is one piece to reduce weight, but make sure you get your steerer length correct before cutting! To compliment their fork, Stablead also had this rear shock with carbon canister. Details are thin, but from the sample on display we can see this air shock will feature rebound, compression adjustments, an adjustable bladder and have a lock out lever. On top of carbon parts, Stablead had a range of alloy products on display, all of which should be available from July this year. As well as various stems with a removable faceplate, they had this wrap around design and also a direct mount stem too. Their CNC machined chain sets are made from 7075 alloy with a hard-anodized finished and will be available in 155-175mm lengths at 5mm increments. The chainring is also a Stablead product. There were also 2 flat pedal designs, this thinner model being the more attractive and possibly lighter version (they were fastened down and there were not weight details on display). Again these are machined from 7075 alloy with a hard-anodized finish. I was able to pick this one up and it did feel quite hefty in the hand, but it also felt extremely burly too. I don’t think I’d be worry about clipping a few rocks with these. 32-inch wheels was one of the trends of the show, and this prototype ‘Big Ben’ bikes was used on the Maxxis stand to show off their new big hoops. It was made using machined alloy lugs with tubing bonded into place. The linkage included details of the suspension from the amount of travel (120mm) to the progressively of the kinematic. I suppose other links are available to quickly make changes to the ride. Like it or not, but 32-inch tires are here. It currently looks like it’s being aimed at the XC crowd, but perhaps the introduction of all these new USD forks means we can expect 32-inch wheels and tires to move in to Trail, Enduro and possibly even Downhill? Nukeproof were back at the show under their new owners Belgian Cycling Factory. On display was this prototype Dissent DH bike with a custom rear end. Not many details on this, but the front triangle is a stock Dissent where as the rear has been updated to alter the kinematics. Interestingly the pivots all use Ceramic Speed Bearings which is something usually you see in high-end hubs. A new version of the Nukeproof Reactor was on show. This was actually designed and developed by the original Nukeproof team before the company went under, but the new owners are bringing it back. The updated front triangle now has a flip chip to run either 29" or MX wheels. You all knew it was coming! Here’s the first of around 14 DJI powered bikes spotted at Eurobike 2025. The Commencal Meta SX DJI won’t be available until Spring 2026, but it was quite clearly a show favorite. The Meta SX DJI runs 160mm travel, comes as a mullet only and all sizes but the small have an 800Wh battery. This Eurobike actually marked the first time in many years that Commencal attended. This is NOT a Cotic! This is a Heintz titanium full suspension trail bike spotted in the handmade area of the show. While it might look similar and use a suspension lay-out similar to Cotic’s Drop Link, the builder had made a few changes such as internal cable routing with full internal titanium guides, and a switch to a Horst link rather than the link on the seat stay found on the UK bikes. Also found in the handmade area of the show was the new Orange Phase Evo, the brand's first ever DJI bike and the first DJI bike that is handmade in the UK. The Phase Evo runs around 160mm of travel on Orange’s traditional single pivot suspension layout. The bike uses a new construction design for the downtube where either a 600Wh or 800Wh battery can be fitted. Orange thinks weights could be as low as 20kg. Also spotted on the Orange were HUNT’s latest enduro wheel set the Enduro V3. These alloy wheels feature FEA developed front and rear specific rims and HUNT’s new 40t ratchet free hub design. As ridden by The Firm, T-Mac and many more! Spanish brand Abums had their steel E-MTB on display. This was one of the launch models of the new Mahle E-MTB system and is apparently the world’s first steel electric mountain bike with an integrated battery. Sometimes the greatest finds at Eurobike are the ones you bump into while walking between halls and that is exactly how I came across this one! Handmade in Germany, this is the Truebc trail bike boasting an integrated 8 Pins dropper post and mid pivot suspension layout. Truebc is better known for making carbon components such as MTB rims and gravel parts, but they decided to branch out with frame production. Rather than going for something simple for their first frame they went for a beautifully executed full suspension frame with really neat features. I especially liked the external cable and hose routing that is hidden with a neat carbon cover giving the aesthetic of internal routing but the simplicity of external. Teewing had their Turbo Force carbon trail bike on display at the show. While new to the MTB market, this Chinese brand was one of the brands that made up the 2nd wave of DJI Avinox E-MTB launches earlier in the year. Remember this name because they may soon have an Enduro bike on sale. Rotwild doesn’t have the same brand recognition in the UK as it once did, but in Germany they are still well known for high quality bikes and smart engineering. The new REX E-MTB has a (surprise surprise) DJI Avinox motor, a 4-bar, high pivot suspension layout, 8 Pins integrated dropper and 150mm of travel. But its party trick is the custom carbon battery that is not only larger than a standard Avinox battery but also easily removable. Most DJI bikes require the motor to be dropped to access the battery, but the Rotwild battery slots in to the downtube and can be easily removed and swapped out. Not that it will need much swapping as it is a larger 875Wh battery. Head is better known as a tennis or ski brand but they do also make mountain bikes and this Enduro bike has been something I’ve wanted to see for a while. It’s not listed on the official Head website (at the time of writing) but their social channels have been promoting it for a few months already. The alloy frame has a huge amount of stand over clearance, there’s a modern mid-pivot suspension design with an idler, and there is an interesting choice of components too. Head even have athletes competing on this bike at enduro races in Europe now! But I feel they could have come up with a better name than ‘Downey’. Steppenwolf had a couple of DJI-powered bikes, but it was the newly launched Tundra 11.0 that caught my attention. This 170mm travel enduro bike had an interesting rear suspension layout that, rumor has it, was developed with some input from Unno. Prime Bikes had their entire range of bikes on show at Eurobike 2025, but it was this unreleased trail bike that stole the show for them. The 140mm travel bike runs on 29-inch wheels and showcases the same level of fit and finish we’ve come to expect from Prime. The bike is so new that it isn’t even named yet! There was even a competition running to figure out what it should be called. What would you name it? Let us know in the comments below! Crussis, a Czech mountain bike brand released a whole host of DJI bikes prior to Eurobike. Everything from alloy hardtails all the way up to carbon trail and enduro full suspension bikes! Not only do they have a massive range of models but individual build options and then even an option to fit either a 600Wh or 800Wh battery. It sounds like a merchandising nightmare... Their prices are impressive with an alloy DJI full suspension bike costing as little as €4500. Not this one though, this one is the flagship model with wireless Fox Neo components and the new Podium fork, costing around €11,000. At a show with DJI-powered bikes from the likes of Commencal and Unno, you’re going to want to show something really impressive to stand out. Unfortunately this Kross E Trail DJI bike feels really underwhelming compared to the competition. Polygon had this new trail version of the Collosus on display. The full carbon Collosus T9 promises to be an ‘aggressive trail machine’ and uses their tried and tested IFS suspension platform tuned to offer better small bump sensitivity. The Indonesian brand also had a new XC bike to show the crowds. The Syncline DR is aimed at riders who want to go fast uphill under their own steam and is decked out with RockShox Flight Attendant suspension and a power meter as standard. Please KTM make a downcountry/trail version of this! It looks amazing! One of the most interesting products at the show, and one that I am itching to get my hands on is this EXA Form F36 fork from Kindshock. I spotted this at China Cycle but KS confirmed that this would also be available aftermarket! It will feature an open bath design, with rebound and compression adjustment and uses an air spring. The model on show had 170mm travel and the action (just pushing by hand) felt very smooth with zero breakaway stiction. The most impressive part though is the price, at roughly €400 retail. Sign me up! Kindshock also had their new Rage Circuit wireless dropper on display. The current version has a max drop of 180mm but a 210mm version is in the works too. What’s neat about this is that there is an emergency button on top of the post, so if the battery in the shifter does die mid-ride you can still drop and raise your post. Again impressive pricing, as this will retail at just €399. Maxon were showing off their new motor system and a couple of bikes that are already ready to go on sale. The Maxon Air S weighs just 2kg and produces 90Nm torque and 650W peak power. Not quite as much as other motors, but less power means less battery drain, meaning smaller batteries and a lower weight. Maxon had a couple of bikes on show with their new motor system including this rather nice 145mm travel trail bike from Instictiv. They are also working with smaller brands to allow them to enter the E-MTB market without the risk of high MOQ’s (Minimum Order Quantity) that other manufacturers demand. 2025 might be the year of 32-inch wheels but while Maxxis might be looking at ways to save a few seconds here and their for XC racers, DirtySixer offers 32-inch wheels for larger riders, who need much bigger frames, wheels and... ...pedals! If 32-inch is too small then what about this 36-inch full suspension bike! Even Gary Fisher is shocked to see it! And the final find of the show was this near production ready version of the Velduro Rogue. We first saw this as a 3D-printed sample at the China Cycle Show, but this is a ready to ride and test bike. Velduro is hoping to open pre-orders for their Rogue later in the year. Words and photos by Andi Sykes Surely the as-yet-unnamed Prime bike should be called “Optimus”? Unless I'm missing something the Rotwild is not really a high pivot bike... As for the Steppenwolf, stuff of nightmares incarnated for @seanfisseli ? Lol! I hope I’m in on the joke but I’ll take it! In reply to Unless I'm missing something… by Primoz The Polygon Collosus T uses a VPP linkage (which Polygon calls "IFS Compact") Dear lord!The seat tube angle on that pink Dirtysixer!!! 🤮 woah does this mean Instinctiv is changing their frames to a more palatable shape (read: no egregiously bent top-tube) I am more shocked that it looks nothing like an ebike. In reply to woah does this mean… by LookinForIt Hello Vital MTB Visitor, We’re conducting a survey and would appreciate your input. Your answers will help Vital and the MTB industry better understand what riders like you want. Survey results will be used to recognize top brands. Make your voice heard! Five lucky people will be selected at random to win a Vital MTB t-shirt. Thanks in advance, The Vital MTB Crew

Stablecoins are attracting considerable attention by traditional financial institutions. Regulatory shifts are paving the way for banks to engage with stablecoins. These are rapidly evolving from a niche vertical in the cryptocurrency ecosystem into a foundational element of the global financial system. Stablecoins are increasingly becoming a preferred choice in modern finance, building a bridge between the traditional financial world and the crypto sector. Their evolution is shaping the future of global finance. In this blog we describe what stablecoins are, explore the current state of the stablecoin landscape, focus on key regulatory developments, the adoption by traditional financial institution, the various real-world use cases, the potential and challenges and the various solutions to these challenges. What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are blockchain-based digital tokens designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged one-to-one to traditional fiat currencies, predominantly the U.S. dollar and the euro, or high-quality liquid assets like commodities such as gold, silver or oil. Stablecoins are designed primarily to function as a stable medium of exchange. While their mechanisms may vary, they all aim to combine the trust and stability of fiat currencies (most commonly the US Dollar) associated with traditional banking infrastructure with the efficiency of blockchain-based transfers, thereby avoiding the volatility inherent in traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This makes stablecoins suitable for commercial transactions, international remittances, and storing value digitally. How stablecoins work? The vast majority of stablecoins are fiat-backed. This means that for every digital token issued, an equivalent amount of fiat currency (or highly liquid, low-risk assets like cash equivalents and short-term government bonds) is held in reserves by the issuer. This 1:1 backing is crucial for maintaining their peg to the underlying fiat currency. Regular attestations and audits are essential to ensure the transparency and integrity of these reserves, building trust among users. These tokens will be listed on various crypto exchanges. Present state: stablecoin market capitalization The current market capitalization of stablecoins was worth around $255 billion early June 2025 according to CoinMarketCap. This record high is driven by a wave of adoption from major global banks. With this market capitalization size and a growing presence in cross-border payments, corporate treasury operations, and emerging market finance, stablecoins are fast becoming a relevant tool in global finance. The market itself has been projected to grow to $2 trillion in the next three years. The growth in stablecoin use is clear when looking at the actual transaction volumes. Over the past year 2024, transaction volumes involving stablecoins rose significantly from $521 billion to $710 billion monthly. A significant milestone occurred in 2024 when the total amount of money transferred using stablecoins reached $27.6 trillion—surpassing the combined total transaction volumes processed by Visa and Mastercard that same year. This trend underscores their growing importance in global commerce and remittances. This however is still a small share of the global M2 money supply, approximately 1%. Dominant stablecoins: USDT and USDC The stablecoin market is dominated by USD-backed variants. The two largest stablecoins out there right now are Tether (USDT: $155 billion) and the USD Coin from Circle (USDC: $62 billion). Together they account over 90% of total stablecoin market capitalization. They have gained traction in both crypto and traditional finance circles due to their ability to combine the stability of fiat currencies with the benefits of blockchain technology. This is however not much in the $36 trillion US Treasury market, but the growth has certainly focused US Treasury’s attention. Regulatory clarity: remove fragmentation The regulatory environment for stablecoins in 2025 has evolved dramatically from the fragmented approach of the early 2020s. The dramatic shift towards stablecoins by large institutions follows recent moves by regulatory bodies in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) to create clear frameworks for stablecoins that define capital requirements, reserve management, and operational standards. These regulations may foster innovation while protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. These moves may contribute to the further development of consistent and reliable regulations worldwide for blockchain and crypto-related technologies. EU regulation: MICA The European Union (EU) is at the forefront of stablecoin regulation, having introduced Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation for cryptocurrencies including stablecoins. This regulatory framework is designed to protect investors, promote fair and efficient markets, and foster innovation in the crypto space. The MiCA regulation that came into effect in mid-2024, sets clear rules for stablecoins, significantly reducing regulatory uncertainty. Issuers operating in the EU should adhere to specific financial standards. They must hold full reserves, meet transparency requirements, and be authorized by financial regulators. MiCA does not cover central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), but it allows regulated financial institutions (e.g. banks) to issue or support stablecoins, including acting as custodians or liquidity providers. Banks in the EU now have a legal framework to engage with stablecoins in a compliant way. US regulation: GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act US Congress has recently passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins issuance by banks, aiming to bring stablecoin in the US financial system and creating standards for stablecoin oversight. This should be seen as a step towards creating a more stable and secure environment for their use. They focus on reserve requirements, licensing models and systemic risk considerations. This Act would require stablecoin issuers to hold one-to-one reserves, publish regular audits, and follow clear rules to protect users. Reserves backing stablecoins must be segregated from other corporate assets to reduce risk exposure. Monthly verification of reserves will become standard practice, giving users confidence in the stability of these digital assets. The GENIUS Act allows stablecoin issuers to operate under either federal or qualified state supervision, depending on their size and structure. Together with the STABLE Act that sets rules for the overall crypto market, they are are expected to provide the legal certainty needed for more banks and businesses to participate in the stablecoin market. Banking adoption of stablecoins: gather momentum A notable trend is the increasing involvement of major banks and fintech companies in the stablecoin market. This shift follows years of cautious observation and regulatory scepticism. But improved regular clarity has triggered a growing number of banks now experimenting with stablecoins, recognizing their value for improving operational efficiency, driven by a combination of fiat-like price stability with the speed, efficiency, and programmability of blockchain technology. Bank stablecoin initiatives: some examples This year a growing number of traditional financial institutions and fintechs in both the US, EU and Asia are joining existing financial services giants like Standard Chartered, PayPal, Revolut, and Stripe in adopting stablecoins. These companies are increasingly seeing their potential and have started different stablecoin initiatives, seeking to capitalize on the rapidly growing use of these coins. To give some insight here follows a number of examples of banks entering or planning to enter the stablecoin market, US banks Triggered by the pro-crypto Trump administration and the passing of the Genius Act, a growing number of US banks and fintechs are entering or planning to enter the stablecoin market. Including names like JPMorgan, US Bancorp, Bank of America, BNY Mellon and Paypal. Stripe, a leading fintech company, recently acquisitioned Bridge, a stablecoin orchestration platform. This initiative positions Stripe to enhance its payment processing capabilities, particularly in cross-border transactions. Similar moves are expected from competitors like Goldman Sachs and HSBC EU Banks Also banks in the EU have started to enter the stablecoin market including names like Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank and Banco Santander. The French Bank Societe Generale announced its plans to issue a publicly tradable stablecoin pegged to the US dollar named USD CoinVertible (USDCV) via its digital asset unit, SG-FORGE. This follows the launch of its euro-based stablecoin EUR CoinVertible in 2023. Both stablecoins are classified as electronic money tokens and will be arranged according to MiCA, EU’s crypto regulation. Deutsche Bank is also exploring the use of stablecoins and tokenized deposits, evaluating stablecoin options. Bloomberg reports that Deutsche Bank is actively researching how these technologies could be used within its services. Other banks, such as Banco Santander and Credit Lyonnais are also exploring stablecoins. Banco Santander has early-stage plans to launch its own euro- or dollar-denominated stablecoin or offering access to an existing one. Santander's Openbank unit has applied for MiCA licenses in Europe. Asian Banks Asia is leading the world in real-world stablecoin adoption, aimed to make stablecoins a foundational layer of Asia’s evolving payments infrastructure. Stablecoins are now a strategic lever for financial institutions in countries like Singapore (Standard Chartered’s Hong Kong branch), South Korea and Hong Kong (Ant Group), institutions are moving quickly—not just to explore stablecoins, but to scale them. But also in countries like Japan where the three largest banks (MUFG, SMBC, and Mizuho) joined a pilot platform called “Project Pax” to use stablecoins for cross-border payments. In Australia ANZ Bank launched an AUD-pegged stablecoin and executed the first public blockchain transaction by an Australian bank, now expanding use cases including real-time pension payments. These examples illustrate that stablecoins are gradually becoming part of mainstream financial infrastructure, not just for crypto-native firms, but for some of the world’s largest banks Stablecoin use cases While the bulk of stablecoin use is currently still within the crypto capital markets and not for everyday payments, this is fundamentally changing. Growing regulatory clarity is expected to unlock broader use cases. These may include cross-border payments and foreign exchange transactions, crypto trading in DeFi, on-chain settlement as well as cash, liquidity and collateral management. Stablecoins are increasingly seen as practical tools to broad institutional use for everyday financial transactions. Cross border payments Financial institutions are considering using stablecoins to improve its payment systems. Cross-border transactions through traditional banking systems can be slow and expensive due to high fees and currency conversion costs. Stablecoins may fundamentally transform how money moves across borders, addressing long-standing pain points in traditional payment systems, delivering reduced costs, speeding up settlements, and increasing financial inclusion. Stablecoins offer the potential to make international transfers faster and more cost-effective compared to some traditional correspondent banking methods. When supported by appropriate infrastructure (such as wallets and custody providers), these funds can be received and accessed by the counterparty almost immediately. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Another major use case where stablecoins are already thriving is decentralized finance (DeFi). They serve as the foundational currency for DeFi applications, enabling lending, borrowing, swapping, yield farming, and more - all without centralized intermediaries. Their programmable nature allows for automated transactions that traditional banking systems cannot match in efficiency or cost. Stablecoins are becoming the essential bridge connecting traditional finance with cryptocurrency ecosystems through DeFi protocols. Banks can use them to automate financial processes like collateralized lending, borrowing, derivatives trading, and even tokenization. This programmability allows banks to participate in blockchain-based financial markets while streamlining operations like asset management and market making. “Programmable Treasury” A third use case of stablecoins is as a means of payment. Governments generally want citizens to transact in their local currencies, and stablecoins challenge that sovereignty. Stablecoins are increasingly being integrated into payment platforms, enhancing the efficiency of transactions. Stablecoins are making it possible for businesses to automate payments based on real-world conditions. This is known as “programmable treasury”. More Accessible Loan Products Stablecoins could also unlock new lending and borrowing mechanisms within traditional banking by leveraging the transparency and programmability of blockchain technology. This could create more accessible loan products, collateralized by stablecoins themselves, opening up new markets and customer segments currently underserved by traditional lending practices. Attract capital and increase available liquidity Financial institutions could also offer reserve management services for assets backing stablecoins. This involves managing significant deposits and ensuring issuers meet regulatory obligations for transparency and liquidity. By welcoming stablecoin issuers as depositors, offering competitive and secure deposit solutions, providing them with secure, low-risk returns, banks can unlock new liquidity pools and expand their capital base and increase the amount of available liquidity, expanding their base of long-term, dependable clients. Onderkant formulier What may stablecoins bring for traditional banks? Financial industry executives cited slow transaction speeds and high fees in traditional banking systems as driving factors for stablecoin adoption. Stablecoins offer unique advantages by combining the stability of assets like fiat currencies with the benefits of blockchain technology. Using stablecoins may bring a number of important advantages including price stability, speed and efficiency, lower costs, global accessibility and programmability, making them attractive to international businesses and supply chains. Unlike cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, their value remains relatively steady because they are tied to the value of more stable assets. This makes stablecoins a safer choice for risk-averse traders and investors who want to explore crypto markets without exposing themselves to drastic price fluctuations. Next to that stablecoins enable near-instant settlement of cross-border transactions. By eliminating intermediaries like correspondent banking, they enable domestic and cross-border payments to settle in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of traditional systems, while offering 24/7 services. Transaction costs may also dramatically decrease. By lowering the transaction costs often associated with traditional banking intermediaries, stablecoins also make financial services more affordable and accessible to a wider audience. Challenges Despite the enthusiasm and their advantages for traditional financial institutions, stablecoins face a number of challenges related to regulatory compliance, interoperability issues and liquidity risks.. Regulatory fragmentation: unclarity and risks Notwithstanding regulation in the EU and upcoming regulations in the US, stablecoins currently still operate under a patchwork of regulations worldwide, leading to unclarity around compliance, especially concerning reserve requirements and licensing. Notably, recent data from Chainalysis reveals that stablecoins are increasingly favoured in illicit activities such as money laundering and sanctions evasion. This underscores the global implications of stablecoin integration and the need for coordinated regulatory approaches. Lack of interoperability Financial institutions also face operational and credit risks inherent in digital currency management. The real challenge will be in the interoperability between stablecoins and existing financial systems. The existence of stablecoins across multiple blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Polygon) introduces challenges in transaction settlements, requiring interoperability solutions. For businesses to fully adopt stablecoin payments, suppliers must be equipped to receive them, necessitating updates to wallets, regulatory clarity, and accounting systems Other risks And here is the liquidity risk. Stablecoins' influence extends beyond yields. The BIS notes that $40 billion in 2024 Treasury purchases by stablecoins outpaced many foreign investors, illustrating their role as de facto market participants. However, their reserve compositions often lack transparency, leaving investors vulnerable to sudden de-pegging events. Managing these risks requires robust compliance frameworks, security measures, and strict adherence to regulatory requirements, complicating their widespread adoption by traditionally cautious banks. Innitiatives by banks Consortium-backed stablecoin A group of big US banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC, met a few weeks ago in a working group to discuss the prospect of offering stablecoins in a collaborative effort. This initiative to develop a consortium-backed stablecoin aims to streamline routine financial transactions, improve transaction speeds whilst managing competition from encroaching crypto firms and counter the growing influence of crypto-native firms and fintech competitors. The potential introduction of a consortium-backed stablecoin by major banks could significantly impact the competitive landscape for community banks and credit unions. Offering familiar, secure interfaces For corporates, accessing stablecoins still involves a lot of manual steps and unfamiliar tools like wallets. Banks can fill this gap by offering familiar, secure interfaces that integrate stablecoin functionality into their existing online banking and treasury services. This include amongst others: helping clients move between fiat currency and stablecoins (and vice versa), or between different stablecoins, holding stablecoins securely on behalf of their clients, streamlining KYC/AML, source-of-funds checks, and transaction screening for blockchain-based payments and guiding clients on how and when to use stablecoins for payments, treasury management or regional risk hedging. Support from blockchain infrastructure providers Companies like Circle at the forefront of transformation Companies like Circle, the global issuer of USDC are at the forefront of this transformation, offering banks cross-chain clearing and other innovative solutions that could reshape the financial landscape. Increased involvement from the traditional financial industry is further supported by the advent of blockchain infrastructure providers like Zero Hash and Fireblocks, which are offering technology geared towards traditional financial institutions looking to integrate stablecoin capabilities. Stripe, which acquired stablecoin orchestration platform Bridge in February 2025, has added payment capabilities for the company’s USDB stablecoin, which generates yield through backing by BlackRock money market funds. Earlier this month, Stripe announced it is rolling out Stablecoin accounts in 101 countries. Matera and Circle join forces: building bridges in payments In a move to accelerate the adoption of stablecoins as a mainstream payment method, Matera, a leading technology provider for the financial system, announced a commercial partnership with Circle, through its regulated dollar-backed stablecoin USDC. This alliance marks the integration between a real-time banking infrastructure and a fully-reserved, transparent stablecoin, at the forefront of interoperability between local currency balances and digital dollars. This partnership unlocks their use in everyday near-instant payments - secure, fast, and accessible - directly from banking and fintech platforms powered by Matera’s real-time ledger, Digital Twin. The collaboration between Matera and Circle advances the concept of a “stablecoin-ready banking platform” building bridges between traditional and digital money. Criticism: BIS and Lagarde Notwithstanding the growing embrace of stablecoins by traditional financial institutions criticism has come recently from the BIS and ECB president Lagarde. BIS report A new report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has cast doubt on the long-term role of stablecoins in the global financial system. The authors acknowledged that stablecoins have some benefits, including programmability, pseudonymity, and ease of use. Their structure also offers faster and cheaper transactions, particularly for cross-border payments. But the BIS concluded that these advantages are outweighed by risks, especially when compared to money issued by central banks and regulated financial institutions, arguing that they fall short of three essential criteria for functioning as true money: singleness, elasticity, and integrity. These are the core traits the BIS says are necessary for any instrument that hopes to support a modern monetary system. ECB president Lagarde In a recent statement ECB president Lagarde told stablecoins are privately issued and pose in particular risks to monetary policy and financial stability. Stablecoins must therefore “be governed by sound rules, especially when operating internationally”. According to Lagarde the underlying problem is precisely the lack of uniform rules. This fragmented approach prevents a global level playing field and can open the door to new risks and systemic vulnerabilities. “We must therefore remain alert to developments in other jurisdictions and support globally aligned regulations for stablecoins.” Lagarde. She therefore plaids for a Dital Euro. Forward looking: Market future and Expectations As we move through 2025, the stablecoin landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Upcoming regulation is expected in other regions worldwide including the UK, Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea) Australia and Japan. As stablecoins continue gaining traction globally, the financial industry anticipates further adoption, spurred by increasing regulatory clarity and growing consumer trust. In 2025, stablecoins are increasingly being integrated into the financial services infrastructure, a first step bridging the gap between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world thereby enhancing business banking services. Banks that respond early can shape how this technology fits within their client offerings. As banks and fintech companies intensify their involvement, the stablecoin market stands on the threshold of significant transformation. The momentum behind stablecoins suggests they will play a significant role in reshaping the future of global financial system. The next step will be the worldwide introduction of Digital Euro’s and Digital dollars.

Title: Revealed: How much supermarket prices have risen since 2022

Plus You are not permitted to download, save or email this image. Visit image gallery to purchase the image. Photo: RNZ By Louise Ternouth of RNZ Whether it is a block of butter or cheese, a kilogram of mince, a dozen eggs or a cooked chook, food prices have gone up rapidly. The latest Stats NZ figures show in the past 12 months food prices have gone up 4.4 percent - the highest increase since December 2023. Over the last three years Checkpoint has been tracking a weekly shop from the same suburb at a Woolworths and Pak'nSave supermarket to see just how much things have gone up at the checkout. Some of the results are more eye-watering than mouthwatering. For over three years, Checkpoint has been tracking the cost of 36 items likely to be in a household's trolley. In May 2022, our first shop at Woolworths Greenlane cost us $238 dollars and $217 at Pak'nSave Royal Oak. Today, those same items at Woolworths have shot up to $305 dollars - an extra $67 dollars at the checkout. Pak'nSave our shop, now set us back $270, an extra $53 dollars. Compared to our 2022 shop, seasonal vegetables like carrots and cabbage were cheaper. Other items that had come down slightly or stayed the same were Watties baked beans, plain flour, Mightyfresh wheatmeal toast bread and diced tomatoes. File photo But they were mostly exceptions, most of the items on the shopping list cost more. Some shoppers told Checkpoint they have noticed an increase on some items in particular. "Olive oil is really expensive and eggs," said one shopper. "Dairy items I've noticed but even just general fresh fruit and vege." Others said meat was on the list. Unsurprisingly, dairy had one of the biggest jumps. At both supermarkets you still could not get a 1kg block of cheese for $10 or less. Though 1kg is now $1 dollar cheaper at Woolworths for $12.49. At Pak'nSave a 1kg block stayed much the same at $11.89. Two litres of standard blue top milk were sitting at just under $5 at both supermarkets. In 2022, a 500g block of Woolworths-branded butter cost $5.80, now a whopping $8.50. At Pak'nSave it was a similar story, in 2022 it was $5.70 for a Pams 500g block, now $8.30. One shopper said their family uses a lot of butter and they were feeling the pinch, "It's been absolutely ridiculous it's almost $10." Others said they bought butter in bulk from Costco to save money "to buy cheaper New Zealand butter in bulk and freeze it rather than buying at the supermarkets." A 50 box of Twining's Earl Grey tea more than doubled in price at Pak'nSave to $7.89. As for a dozen barn eggs, those more than doubled at Pak'nSave to $9.59 and $9.50 at Woolworths. The humble beef mince now not so humble at 1kg used to cost $11.99 at Pak'nSave, now $18.99. At Countdown, it was up from $14.90 in 2022 to $23.80 now. For some, it is now a luxury among other items they are going without. "Probably meat products and dairy," said one shopper. Others were also leaving those products on the shelves and opting for a butter "blend" and no brand versions. One man said snacks were off the shopping list. "Snack bars and extra things you'd put into kids lunches." One woman said she had left her broccoli and cauliflower out of the shop. Washing and toiletry products also came out far more expensive. Four kilograms of Persil sensitive washing powder was $22 at both supermarkets in 2022, now an extra $13 at Woolworths and $6.50 more at Pak'nSave. Huggies size 3 nappies were an extra $10 at Pak'nSave and a litre of Palmolive body wash was an extra $5 at Woolworths. For those advising to stock up on staples or frozen to cut costs, rice, noodles, sugar and frozen vegetables - all more expensive. SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER

The counter touched an intraday high of ₹331.90, extending its winning streak that has delivered a cumulative 13 per cent return over the past five trading sessions. The rally follows a series of regulatory approvals that have strengthened investor confidence in the company’s financial services expansion. On Friday, Jio BlackRock Broking, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jio BlackRock Investment Advisers, received approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to operate as a brokerage firm. This approval complements earlier regulatory nods granted to Jio BlackRock Asset Management and Jio BlackRock Investment Advisers. Jio BlackRock Investment Advisers operates as a 50:50 joint venture between Jio Financial Services and US-based BlackRock Inc.

Title: The Irish woman reviving ballet in Venice: ‘As a lawyer, ballet became my escape’

Time Published: 2025-06-30T05:00:00Z

“The idea is to draw more people into the world of ballet, expose them to a wide variety and bring classical ballet back to Venice,” says Gerardine Connolly, who has been working hard in recent years to create a new ballet company for the Italian city. A successful Irish barrister with a long dedication to the arts, she and co-founder and artistic director Alessio Carbone are on an ambitious mission to revitalise dance in Venice. “It was once the ballet capital of the world, and in the 18th century there were more ballet theatres than in any other city. That rich heritage disappeared without a trace 30 years ago,” Connolly explains. “We want to revive the city’s dance past and reintroduce classical and neo classical ballet to Venetian audiences.” Last July their company Il Balletto di Venezia made a promising debut in Palazzo Barbaro with three ballet excerpts, followed by a presentation in the medieval city of Vicenza that earned a standing ovation. They then travelled to in Messina in Sicily to give an open-air performance, and ended back in Venice with six shows in the church of San Vio, “where we opened the doors and allowed free entrance – there were queues all the way down the street”. For Season Two in July, they have recruited 12 talented dancers from prominent ballet schools, including La Scala and Paris Opera as well as American Ballet Theatre. Nine short vignettes will be performed, each four to six minutes long and involving two dancers, followed by the whole troupe coming together for the finale. “The main idea is to present a piece of work – not like a full ballet telling a story – so you go from excitement to melancholic to finale,” Connolly says. It will open on July 6th in the 15th century Scuola Grande di San Rocco, famous for its Tintoretto paintings and frescoes, before travelling to Florence and Sardinia, finishing in Dublin at the Royal Irish Academy of Music on July 30th. It will be the first time a ballet has been staged at the academy. How did an eminent Irish senior counsel, not a dancer herself, become involved in this venture? Some clues can be found in Connolly’s background. Born in Bangor, one of five siblings, she was educated at Sion Hill in Blackrock and, following in her brothers’ footsteps, trained at King’s Inn. She loved ballet from an early age. “My mother was quite artistic and I loved to dance, but never went to ballet classes. It remained always there in my imagination, as did a love of music, and instead I became a classical guitarist. As a lawyer, ballet became my escape from the adversarial nature of the legal profession,” Connolly says. During her 20s and 30s, Connolly would go to Paris nearly every weekend “and head straight up to Opera Bastille to watch ballet – it was my way of finding an equilibrium in my life,” she says. Her apartment was “floor to ceiling ballet catalogues from the Palais Garnier”, which she kept for 15 years before moving to the Rue St Sulpice “and the ballet world continued”. She married the acclaimed sculptor Patrick O’Reilly, who she met in Fitzwilliam Square, and the couple bought an apartment in Venice in the Palazzo Barbaro on the Grand Canal, once home to Henry James for several weeks in 1892. She remembers the thrill of discovering the city with friends, including the late architect John Meagher and Liberato Santoro Brienza, then professor of aesthetics in UCD. “We fell deeply in love with the city, and would go there at least once a month,” she recalls. When friends who lived there asked her what she was going to do in Venice, she replied: “There’s no ballet here, so I’m going to start a ballet company.” At a performance of the opera La Dame Aux Camelias in Venice, Connolly was introduced to Alessio Carbone, “and we just connected”. A renowned ballet dancer, Carbone had a long career at the Paris Opera from 1997 until his retirement in 2020. From ballet royalty, he began his training at his parents’ school in Venice. His father is a renowned ballet director in La Scala and other Italian opera houses, his mother a star dancer, his sister a ballerina and a brother a flamenco dancer. “Alessio and I then arranged to meet in the Gritti Palace hotel and discussed the idea of starting a ballet company in Venice. It was the beginning of a beautiful collaboration,” Connolly explains. Carbone had already founded a dance company in 2016 in an attempt to breathe some classical dance life back into his native city, as well as directing and organising productions for various festivals and theatres the world over. He was also involved with community projects, teaching dance workshops for underprivileged children in Brazil, performing in hospices for the terminally ill, and organising a ballet to raise funds for the Red Cross efforts in Ukraine. “He knows all the ballet masters, the dancers and the opera houses and is brilliant in terms of knowledge and artistic integrity,” says Connolly. They plan to scout directly with renowned schools, offering gifted graduates without employment the opportunity of work. They hope to capitalise on the pure classical technique typical of young graduates, often lost when they enter companies with a heavily modern repertoire. “We want to create a desirable place for international dance artists to evolve, bring a high-level international audience to Venice and place ballet once again centre stage,” Connolly says describing the ambitious intentions of this not-for-profit company. Her own favourite ballet is Giselle. “If I can ever put that one on, I will hang up my boots,” Connolly says. “I am always drawn to the melancholic, and that’s what resonates with me. I am also attracted to anything very moralistic – Giselle is very philosophical and so beautiful. Modern dance doesn’t resonate for me in the same way. My heart and soul is in classical, and that is where I am transported. I go into a trance watching the death of the swan in Swan Lake.” Supremely stylish in appearance, she cuts an impressive figure at every level and now travels between Dublin and Venice having stepped back from legal work. “I went ahead with this not knowing what I was facing,” Connolly says, “but I knew that whatever it cost, it was going to be fine. I didn’t understand the extensive work and responsibility until it was all over, but we got there.” Like another pioneering Irishwoman, Ninette de Valois from Wicklow who founded the Royal Ballet and the Turkish State Ballet, Connolly has set her aims high and obstacles have not dampened her determination to succeed. Sponsorship, both private and public, is now forthcoming including from the Moszkowski Foundation in the US, Temple Recruitment and the Ronan Group, enabling financial security for the company for at least three years, “but it’s a major project and I am still in shock”, Connolly adds with a laugh. “I can see this family getting huge – all the dancers want to come back, so let it balloon now.” Il Balletto di Venezia opens in Venice on July 5th, travels to Moncalvo, Sardinia, Florence and Treviso, closing in Dublin at the RIAM on July 30th.

Title: Bitcoin: Will Q3 unlock BTC’s path to $110K and beyond?

With volatility building, Bitcoin’s next leg hinges on who gets caught in the net. The crypto market is teetering on a knife’s edge. The sentiment is holding neutral as bulls and bears battle for control of Bitcoin [BTC] in a high-stakes tug-of-war. This kind of setup usually opens the door for opportunistic traders to take sides, creating an ideal setup for a fresh volatility squeeze. According to AMBCrypto, how this standoff resolves could shape Bitcoin’s next major leg. Bitcoin is closing out Q2 with a decisive rebound from its multi-month low of $98k, right as the macro fear started to cool off. That move pretty much wiped out the bears who were pricing in prolonged geopolitical risk. At the time of writing, Futures market data showed that only 58% of longs were sitting in a potential squeeze zone, down significantly from over 80% just a week ago. Clearly, the market just went through a major leverage reset. Still, as Bitcoin creeps back toward that $110k target, shorts are starting to circle again. And with price stabilizing in the $106k-$108k range after the early-week breakout, bears now have a clearly defined zone to defend. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) Nothing captures this better than James Wynn, a trader who’s made headlines this cycle for repeatedly taking high-leverage BTC positions that often end in liquidation. He’s back at it, this time with a 40x short worth $1.49 million, sitting dangerously close to a liquidation level of $108,630. It’s an aggressive bet that places him right at the edge of current price action. Whether Wynn is seeing something the broader market isn’t or simply repeating old mistakes, his position could become the trigger for Bitcoin’s next volatility spike. Unlike the swift early-June rebound where Bitcoin rallied nearly 10% off the $100,424 weekly low and reclaimed $110k in just four bullish candles, this current price action looks more measured. The shift in tempo aligns with a key macro signal: Tether’s [USDT] circulating supply just printed a fresh all-time high at $158 billion, pointing to growing stablecoin liquidity flowing into the system. Source: Glassnode In this context, Bitcoin’s more gradual climb could reflect smart money accumulation rather than speculative chasing, especially with BlackRock reportedly adding $1.15 billion in BTC weekly. This paints its current consolidation as a potential launchpad for a more calculated $110k retest heading into early Q3. If upward pressure persists, Wynn’s 40x short and the 64% short skew on Binance derivatives could become structural fuel for a short squeeze, positioning BTC for a fresh all-time high.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Add 1,430 BTC Daily As AUM Heads For 1.2M Mark – Analyst

The US Bitcoin Spot ETFs have been one of key bullish drivers of the present market cycle, heralding an influx of institutional investors into the BTC ecosystem. In 18 trading months, these ETFs have acquired 6.25% of the Bitcoin market cap cementing their status as a major force in the market. Interestingly, prominent market analyst Axel Adler Jr. has pointed to a recent positive trend within the Bitcoin ETF space, suggesting further upside potential and a bullish outlook for the months ahead. In an X post on June 28, market analyst Axel Adler Jr. highlighted a compelling trend in the accumulation pattern of US Bitcoin Spot ETFs over the past three months. The renowned analyst explains that assets under management (AUM) i.e. net assets of these ETFs excluding the Grayscale GBTC have grown significantly from 932,000 BTC in April 2025 to 1,056,000 BTC today. This development represents a net gain of 124,000 BTC over 87 days, averaging an impressive inflow of 1,430 BTC per day. As the undisputed market leader, the BlackRock IBIT accounts for the majority of this growth attracting 118,000 BTC i.e. 1,360 BTC per day in deposits. In contrast, the remaining 11 ETFs contributed a combined total of 6,000 BTC, or 70 BTC per day, indicating a clear concentration of investor interest around BlackRock’s product. According to Adler Jr., if institutional investors maintain the current accumulation pace of 1,430 BTC per day, these Bitcoin ETFs are on course to hit an AUM of 1,840,000 BTC by September, representing 9.25% of the circulating BTC tokens. Within that total, BlackRock IBIT is expected to hold an estimated 817,000 BTC. When combined with GBTC’s current AUM of $19.79 billion, Adler Jr.’s predictions mean the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs would hold net assets valued significantly over $197.54 billion. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $107,339 reflecting a minor price growth of 0.28% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 33.88% and valued at $30 billion. On larger time frames, the premier cryptocurrency also maintains a positive performance with gains of 5.61% and 1.06% on the weekly and monthly chart respectively, indicating a potential bullish momentum shift following weeks of range-bound movement. Since establishing a new all-time high of $111,970 in late May, Bitcoin has struggled to explore new price territory, instead settling into a descending channel between $100,000 and $110,000.

UPDATED 13:32 EDT / JUNE 29 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante and David Floyer Intel Corp.’s new chief executive has promised to clean up the balance sheet, slim down the company, return to a culture of engineering, sharpen its customer focus, shore up its products, become a world-class independent foundry and lead Intel for as long as it takes to achieve success – however that is defined. As our audience knows, unlike most other analysts, we have aggressively emphasized the icebergs ahead for Intel since 2013, culminating in our prediction that Intel would go bankrupt trying to execute on its previous strategy. Though we would have preferred a different approach to Intel’s foundry – that is, a joint venture with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. – CEO Lip-Bu Tan (pictured) at least has what we consider to be a viable go-forward plan. The steady-state outcome of this new direction, however, is far from certain. Our current thinking is that in addition to LBT’s cost-cutting, cultural do-over and other structural changes, Intel must execute on the following four strategies: In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest thinking about where Intel is now headed. We’ll review some striking data on Intel’s ascendency, how its fall from grace eerily echoes that of IBM Corp. 35 years ago, the daunting task of competing in foundry, its product outlook going forward, how we would approach its future, and a map of how the data center landscape has changed and what it will look like in the coming decades. Few technology narratives rival the dominance – and the subsequent reversal of fortune – of the x86 architecture. One of those narratives – IBM’s fall from dominance – has similar dimensions and is one we’ll draw upon today as a guidepost to the future. The story of Intel’s rise through the 1980s into the early 2000s is one of relentless execution, volume leverage, and ecosystem advantage. As shown below in Exhibit 1, x86 revenues grew from modest beginnings in the mid-’80s to become the heart of both client and data center computing. Our research indicates that this expansion was driven by several foundational advantages: From 1995 to 2000, x86 revenues grew at an impressive compound annual growth rate of 32% overall and 41% in the data center sector. Intel’s momentum carried through the 2000s, but as the chart makes clear, the story changed as time progressed. Though COVID briefly reinvigorated x86 revenues due to a surge in demand for PCs, with the shift to parallel processing, it has became clear to everyone finally that the architecture is facing a secular decline. Specifically: In our view, the COVID spike masked structural weaknesses in the x86 market. As alternative architectures – especially Arm-based designs — gained traction in cloud, mobile and now even AI, the moat that once protected Intel has deteriorated. Nonetheless, it’s important to acknowledge the sheer scale and historical success of this architecture. As David Floyer aptly put it, this was a “magnificent journey” driven by Intel’s mastery of both PC and server economics. We believe the x86 story is now well beyond its turning point. The architecture that once swept aside its predecessors is facing its own moment of reckoning – a pattern we’ll explore further as we dive into Intel’s current strategy and long-term bets. To understand Intel’s current situation, it’s essential to appreciate the historical momentum that carried the company for decades. The 15-year period from 1985 to 2000 represents the golden age of x86 – and by extension, the Wintel era. During this time, Intel didn’t just ride the PC wave – it helped define it, in concert with Microsoft. As PC chip revenues exploded, the tight integration between Intel and Microsoft created an unstoppable force as articulated above in Exhibit 2. We believe the secret to the dominance of x86 lies in the flywheel effect of volume, value and velocity. Intel supplied the volume – economies of scale and manufacturing capacity that no competitor could match. Microsoft delivered the value, with Windows becoming the de facto standard in both consumer and enterprise environments. Together, they removed friction and accelerated velocity across the industry. This dynamic had a cascading effect: In our opinion, this period laid the foundation for Intel’s dominance – but also embedded structural dependencies that would later become liabilities. The same tight coupling with Windows, the same x86-centric worldview, and the same centralized design ethos that once propelled Intel forward would later hinder its ability to adapt to changing market forces. While x86 volumes and margins drove Intel’s ascendancy in PCs and data centers, a quieter disruption was unfolding in parallel. It’s now well-understood that what began as consumer novelties – devices such as Apple’s iPod – would evolve into a tectonic platform shift that Intel failed to capitalize on. Arm’s architecture, with its low power consumption and efficient instruction sets, was tailor-made for the mobile era. Apple recognized this early on. When Intel passed on competing for the design win, Apple selected Arm with its superior battery life and thermals as key differentiators. The iPhone’s success would soon validate that choice and eventually bleed into PCs and the enterprise. The broader ecosystem followed suit as described in Exhibit 3 above: Our research suggests that Intel’s pass on Apple smartphones wasn’t just a product decision – it was a strategic failure rooted in institutional inertia. Moreover, our sources at the time suggested that Apple gave Intel some number of months to develop a plan to manufacture iPhone chips, at least giving it a possible angle to participate in the new volume play. Apple rejected the bid, reportedly because of Intel’s lack of customization and service capabilities in its foundry. This wasn’t the first opportunity Intel missed, but it was arguably the most consequential. Former CEO Paul Otellini would later admit it was a mistake to pass on the original iPhone chip design, a decision that left long-lasting damage. In our opinion, this moment marked a generational turning point. We believe the core issue was that Intel misunderstood the strategic importance of volume, despite that very same volume advantage that allowed it to crush RISC-based systems in earlier decades. Arm’s gains were initially dismissed because they didn’t show up in revenue or profit – but volume conferred learning cycles, developer traction and economies of scale. These advantages mirrored Intel’s own rise decades earlier, yet the company failed to recognize the parallel. As early as 2013, David Floyer warned that mobile volumes would overwhelm x86’s dominance, just as x86 once toppled minicomputers and mainframes. That prediction – once considered premature – now appears prescient. Even by that time, Arm-based silicon had already surpassed Intel in unit volumes as shown in Exhibit 4 above. Despite this, Intel took no decisive action. The company that once prided itself on paranoia and performance leadership had, in effect, lost its sense of urgency. As the mobile revolution accelerated outside the data center spotlight, few in the enterprise took it seriously. Many analysts became sanguine and sometimes fixated on Intel’s continued strength. X86 had long since vanquished RISC Unix systems in the server market, and with the rise of cloud computing, Intel’s market position only seemed to harden. From the dot-com era through the 2010s, Intel rode a powerful wave – that to some looked, if not unshakable, still promising. Below in Exhibit 5 we recount this history. That illusion would persist until COVID exposed structural flaws. From 2000 to 2020, Intel executed a bottom-up invasion of the data center: This momentum carried into the 2010s, but signs of trouble began to appear. Major cloud providers, particularly Amazon Web Services Inc., started looking for ways to reduce dependence on Intel. Initial trials with AMD failed to displace x86, but Amazon eventually turned to internal development through Annapurna Labs. The birth of the Graviton processor marked a strategic pivot – away from x86 and toward Arm. Still, none of this was widely seen as a threat by many analysts. Then came COVID. The pandemic triggered a surge in PC demand as remote work took hold. Volume spiked. OEMs such as Dell Technologies Inc. experienced a jump in PC revenue. And many, including Intel leadership, misread the signal. Some believed this uptick represented a sustainable resurgence in x86 demand. But it was a temporary anomaly – a final burst of relevance. In our view, this period was a mirage for Intel – masking underlying erosion in the company’s strategic position. The same volume flywheel that once catapulted x86 forward had reversed. Mobile and Arm-based architectures now held the growth leveer, while Intel clung to a temporarily inflated market. The parallels to IBM’s past are striking. Just as Big Blue failed to respond to the rise of lower-cost CMOS designs and was encumbered by mainframe inertia, Intel failed to respond to Arm’s volume and efficiency lead. In both cases, success bred complacency. And as history reminds us, only the paranoid survive. Intel loses 62 percentage points of data center processor share in four years. In the wake of COVID, the illusion of x86’s staying power evaporated – not only in PCs but in the data center as well. As highlighted in the Exhibit 6 below, Intel’s data center revenue has suffered a sharp and sustained decline, squeezed from below by AMD and from above by Nvidia. Between 2020 and 2024, Intel’s share of the data center processor market dropped from 73% to just 11%. This moment, in our view, echoes a pivotal chapter in tech history: IBM in 1990. We believe the same forces are now playing out with Intel – just inverted. Intel was once the disruptor, unseating IBM by embracing x86 and riding the volume economics of PC chips. But it has now become the incumbent being disrupted, this time by a new compute paradigm – so-called accelerated computing. The catalyst was the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, which unleashed a torrent of demand for AI workloads. The traditional scalar processing model that underpinned x86 is ill-suited for AI inference and training at scale. In contrast, Nvidia’s graphics processing unit-based architecture – what we refer to as extreme parallel processing or EPP – has emerged as the ideal foundation for generative AI. We see this as more than a cycle – it’s a complete market reset. What’s different this time is that the shift isn’t just to faster or cheaper chips. Rather it’s a move to a fundamentally different architecture, better suited to the AI era. Traditional scalar processing is giving way to parallel. General-purpose CPUs are ceding ground to domain-specific accelerators. And the dominant suppliers of the past are being replaced by platform companies optimized for the future. In short, where Intel once rode the rise of microprocessors to dethrone IBM, it now faces a similar fate – overtaken by a new architecture, a new set of economic drivers, and a new dominant monopoly in the form of Nvidia. Much of our concern around Intel centers on its ambition to become a world-class foundry outside of its own captive production. The company has publicly committed to regaining process leadership and serving external customers at scale. Yet the economic realities suggest this is a monumental challenge – one that history tells us is extremely difficult to overcome without unlimited capital and time. The data in Exhibit 7 below paints a stark contrast between Intel and TSMC: We believe the key indicator here is revenue efficiency. Intel’s foundry is producing just 21 cents of revenue per dollar of PPE investment, using TSMC as the benchmark. That suggests nearly $80 billion of Intel’s capital base is underutilized, with little prospect of near-term profitability. According to Intel’s own 10-K disclosures, the vast majority of depreciation expense is tied to the foundry business. While difficult to isolate, this underscores the scale of the challenge – an asset-heavy, capital-intensive business that is currently delivering negative economic value. Our view is that this economic disconnect was one major reason Intel has been unable – or unwilling – to pursue more aggressive structural moves, such as spinning off its foundry or forming a joint venture with TSMC. There is a reluctance to acknowledge that, on a GAAP basis, the foundry likely represents negative value. This dynamic mirrors what IBM faced when it paid GlobalFoundries $1.5 billion to take its microelectronics business. No board wants to repeat that headline. And yet, without a drastic rethink, Intel’s balance sheet may remain saddled with unproductive assets. That said, not all hope is lost. Former Intel executive Diane Bryant, who led the data center business during its peak, offered a candid yet cautiously optimistic view. She acknowledged that Intel has tried and failed five times to build a viable foundry business. But she expressed confidence in current CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s leadership, noting that while catching up to the leading edge is extremely difficult, not all chips require the most advanced nodes. There is still value in legacy and trailing-edge capacity — particularly for internet of things and industrial applications. [Listen to Diane Bryant’s commentary regarding Intel’s foundry prospects under the leadership of LBT] We agree with that view, but we also see the risk. Betting on lagging nodes may keep fabs full, but it won’t position Intel to compete with TSMC or Samsung on the most advanced innovation cycles. And though the CHIPS Act may provide some near-term funding relief, it won’t alter the structural economics without fundamental changes in execution. In our opinion: At best, the foundry journey remains a long road with uncertain returns. At worst, it’s a repeat of a painful chapter in U.S. semiconductor history. Under Lip-Bu Tan, our current base case is that Intel will dramatically cut costs, continue to write off assets, compete for N-1 and N-2 process business, and remain far behind TSMC but ahead of foundries such as Global Foundries from a node perspective. We believe it has a 40% chance of becoming a viable foundry for external customers over the long term and a 60% chance of being forced into a more radical change such as IBM faced in 2014. If China invades Taiwan, it could dramatically change these odds in ways we’ll discuss later in this research note. As the world now knows, a new sheriff has emerged in the datacenter – and its name is Nvidia. The torch once held by Intel and Microsoft as the defining force in compute has now been passed to a different kind of duo – that is, Nvidia, CUDA, its libraries, digital twin software and growing ecosystem. In many ways, this new architecture mirrors the dynamics of the Wintel era, with Nvidia combining hardware and software into a de facto standard for the accelerated computing age. We believe the post-ChatGPT surge in demand has only solidified Nvidia’s position as the dominant force shaping the datacenter future. The company is now doing what Intel once did – redefining the stack as described in Exhibit 8 below. Consider the elements of Nvidia’s new playbook: What’s more, Nvidia’s position is not simply the result of better hardware – it’s the integration of software, systems, and developer mindshare that has built a formidable moat. CUDA has become the new x86 – that is, a language and platform every AI developer must understand and use. The growth of Nvidia’s installed base means its APIs, libraries and protocols are now the default. This dominance is reinforced by high-profile validation. As noted recently, even Elon Musk has committed to using Nvidia over alternatives, citing performance and ecosystem maturity as key reasons. From our vantage point, this shift represents a wholesale restructuring of the datacenter value chain: We believe any player hoping to compete must align to this new reality. Whether it’s storage vendors such as Vast Data, or silicon hopefuls like Intel, the future will be defined by how well they integrate with the Nvidia-centric ecosystem – or differentiate meaningfully from it. Nvidia has become the new standard-bearer. And unlike previous cycles, it’s setting the rules at both the hardware and software levels. In our view, tee opportunity for others lies not in displacing Nvidia outright, but in carving out niches of differentiated value within the AI supply chain. The x86 era is not ending tomorrow – but its place in the computing hierarchy is undeniably shifting and far less relevant. As shown in Exhibit 9 below, between 2019 and 2024, x86 revenues declined at a 6% CAGR. And our current forecast indicates an even steeper slide of 13% annually through 2025 for traditional workloads. This decline is structural, not cyclical. The rise of AI has created a new datacenter marketplace, one where general-purpose CPUs are increasingly taking a back seat to AI-optimized architectures. The market for what we call AI Extreme Processing – largely GPU-accelerated, cloud-native, and highly parallel – is projected to grow at a 26% CAGR. By the end of the decade, we believe this new segment will be four times the size of the traditional x86 compute market. In this new world: In our view, the x86 market has now entered what we’d call a “managed decline” phase: The most likely scenario is that x86 continues to serve legacy workloads, particularly in enterprise, client, and embedded use cases. But the new innovation cycles – especially in AI and next-gen data platforms – will increasingly exclude x86 in favor of architectures purpose-built for extreme parallel processing. We believe Intel and AMD would do well to maximize the value of their x86 franchises while investing selectively in areas where they can add differentiated value – particularly where performance, latency or governance create competitive moats. We’ll explore this in more detail in the next section of this note. Given its declining share in data center compute, mounting foundry losses and missed opportunities in smartphones and AI, Intel now faces a critical juncture. The future success of the company will depend not on a return to past dominance, but on embracing a different role – one that prioritizes pragmatism, integration with broader ecosystems, and selective leadership in emerging markets. Our research suggests a focused, multi-pronged approach is essential as described in Exhibit 10 above: Looking ahead, the biggest opportunities may lie not in data center, but in AI PCs where no vendor has the advantage, at the edge and in robotics. We predict a major new market will emerge over the next five years – that is, Nvidia-compatible mobile, edge and robotics platforms. Though slower to ramp initially, this segment has the potential to exceed the x86 PC market in both volume and value. Here, Intel has real assets – experience with low-power design, longstanding government relationships, and embedded x86 ecosystems that can be extended or bridged into hybrid platforms. But seizing this opportunity requires alignment with the dominant AI platform – Nvidia — but in a way that differentiates from Nvidia where it is not dominant to avoid becoming a lower-priced, lower-margin “plug-compatible” designer. Internally, the company must take aggressive action: In our view, this path forward won’t recapture Intel’s former glory – but it offers a realistic, value-creating trajectory that aligns with both market trends and national interests. The key will be humility, focus and a willingness to integrate into ecosystems it no longer controls. As we close, we revisit a chart first presented in April 2021 to forecast the coming battle for enterprise tech dominance. We present it as Exhibit 11 below with some arrows to update the changes since that time. Though the chart predates ChatGPT and the generative AI explosion, many of the directional themes have come to pass. Nvidia has moved decisively up and to the right, becoming the undisputed leader in data center innovation. Arm is rising on the back of its increasing ubiquity and the flexibility the fabless model has created. AMD has effectively swapped places with Intel in x86 strength. And China’s ambitions loom larger than ever. What hasn’t changed – but should have in our view – is the U.S. approach to semiconductor sovereignty. The reality is stark in that Intel’s foundry ambitions remain years away from bearing fruit. Even under optimistic scenarios, it will take the better part of a decade for the company to establish even line of site parity with TSMC’s leading-edge capabilities. In parallel, U.S. policymakers and tech leaders have failed to back a bold, actionable plan to secure domestic chip manufacturing at scale – one that could survive geopolitical disruptions in East Asia. In particular, the U.S. is relying on the hope that TSMC will build advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities onshore and bring the requisite talent and IP to create foundries on par with its Taiwanese facilities. We see this as highly unlikely and essentially a capitulation to cede manufacturing leadership to Asia. Pat Gelsinger’s ambitions were not misguided, rather his path to success was virtually impossible without unlimited money and time. And it appears the U.S. government has given up on the ambition to have a U.S.-domiciled and -headquartered firm that develops the most advanced chips. We believe this is a mistake that will come back to haunt the United States. Let’s consider the consequences of a China-controlled Taiwan: This is not a farfetched scenario. Xi Jinping has publicly stated reunification with Taiwan is inevitable. Should that happen in the next three to five years – as Intel is still restructuring and ramping its foundry – America will be left without a domestically headquartered, bleeding-edge chip supplier. We believe this represents a critical failure of both industry and government. Some argue that the U.S. doesn’t need a leading-edge domestic champion – that TSMC’s Arizona investments are sufficient. We disagree. In our view, it is vital that the U.S. not only have advanced manufacturing capacity onshore, but that it is owned, operated, and innovated by a U.S.-domiciled entity. Without that, America risks falling behind in the very arms race that will define this century: AI. We close with this: There is a race underway, not just for compute, but for control of the future — a future where AI capabilities shape economies, militaries and societal outcomes. And though the U.S. still leads in many respects, it cannot afford to forfeit control of the most strategic layer of the technology stack. Intel had the chance to lead that effort. It may still have another with the help of the most powerful country in the world. But the clock is ticking. Support our open free content by sharing and engaging with our content and community.

(AP Photo/Trevor Collens) Lions coach Andy Farrell watches his players warm up ahead of their rugby match against the Western Force in Perth, Australia. Photo: AP Photo/Trevor Collens An opening night outing against the Western Force is a long way from a Six Nations debut in Marseille, but there were shades of Joe McCarthy’s breakthrough performance for Ireland in the way he played in Perth on Saturday. The second-row’s trademark mullet means he fits right in Down Under and he looked as comfortable as he has done in some time as he thundered around the Optus Stadium, skittling blue jerseys as he went. It was a tour de force from the Blackrock second-row, who made two linebreaks and a total 34m across 15 carries and scored a try off the back of Henry Pollock’s brilliant chip and chase. He threw 11 passes including one in the build up that got the Lions moving for Tomos Williams’ try that broke the game open in the second half, with two offloads in the mix as well. Up against retiring former Wallaby Sam Carter and current squad member and enforcer Darcy Swain in the Force second-row, he was a nuisance in contact, turning over a Western Force maul at a crucial stage in the first half, making two dominant tackles and 18 in total in a high work-rate outing. He was busy in the lineout, taking five throws and the local broadcast team that included former Wallaby second row Justin Harrison and Michael Hooper raved about his performance, awarding him the man of the match award. On a night when the Lions’ discipline was highlighted by their coach, McCarthy coughed up just the one penalty. Afterwards, his bruised face bore the hallmarks of a tough night’s work but there was a lightness about the way he spoke that was light years away from his ‘everybody loves to hate Leinster’ line from a few weeks ago. Between the URC title win and a change of scenery, McCarthy looks unburdened and that is a dangerous prospect for the Australians. “It’s such an exciting team to play with – all the players are awesome so you get such a buzz playing with them,” he said. “I loved it. Once I came in for the first session, the standard of training was so high and I just thought, ‘Jeez, I’m going to get so much better, being in this environment.’ I just ripped into it. “It does feel weird [to call yourself a Lion]. It’s very, very cool. “The atmosphere was class and it’s only going to get better. Maybe not all the Lions fans made it to the first game in Western Australia but there were still a lot of red jerseys out there which was cool and there was a good buzz out there. “It was fun to get a bit of space and get my hands free as well. That’s kind of how the Aussies play so that was a bit of a taster today. They look for offloads and linebreaks. It was good to play in a fast-paced game with a lot of offloads.” McCarthy reckons the Lions is going to bring the best out of him. “It’s hard to put your finger on it, sometimes things just happen for you,” he said. “But you might prepare super well for a game and things don’t happen for you. I don’t know. “Especially here, it feels like a level up. There are people here doing everything for you so you try to lean into that, with the medics and the nutritionists. I try to lean on the support staff we have. “I was nervous and on edge a bit this week about playing well, but I’m probably at my best when I feel like my back’s against the wall a little bit.” It helps that McCarthy and his Ireland teammates know the coach and what he wants. Lions coach Andy Farrell watches his players warm up ahead of their rugby match against the Western Force in Perth, Australia. Photo: AP Photo/Trevor Collens Andy Farrell was visibly animated at half time in the dressing-room and he got the required response from the team after the restart. “Andy was pretty calm, generally, but he’s good at getting the boys up,” McCarthy said. “We started really fast but then we let them off the hook a bit with a few penalties. They were still in the game at half-time but then we kicked on a bit. He got us going a bit – he’s really good with the emotion for getting you up. No matter how many games you play for him, he finds a way to do it and we were better for it in the second half.’ “He wants us to be super physical, on the edge, but he tells us, ‘Don’t be desperate, don’t force things – earn the right to get off the line, make tackles and make turnovers.’” This could be a big couple of weeks for the McCarthy family with Joe’s younger brother Paddy in the Ireland squad for their tour of Georgia and Portugal. He’ll then travel out with brother Andrew and parents Joe and Paula in time for the Test series where their boy is set to have a big impact. “I can’t wait for that. They’re going to come out for the last three weeks, to watch the last four games,” McCarthy said. “If Paddy’s playing my family will travel out to Tbilisi. They’ll enjoy that. He was delighted that he made the summer tour and it meant that he could fly to Australia as well. I’m sure he’ll bring his boots with him! “It’s huge. I’d love to see him make his Ireland debut – that would be special.” If he keeps going the way he’s going, they’ll get bang for their buck and in the meantime he’s fully invested in getting the most out of this experience. His role away from rugby is to come up with the Lions’ ‘thought of the day’ with Northampton Saints winger Tommy Freeman. Yesterday, they told the squad that “Today is the oldest you ever have been and the youngest you ever will be”. McCarthy certainly looked like he’s taking an approach that will see him seize his day as a Lion.

Title: Bloomberg: 'Golden Age' of Mass Migration Ends for Business
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/06/29/bloomberg-golden-age-of-mass-migration-ends-for-business/
Time Published: 2025-06-29T16:50:41Z
Full Content:
Business leaders must hire Americans and buy high-tech machines because “the Golden Age [of migration] for employers is ending,” says the pro-migration Bloomberg. “We are witnessing a paradigm shift when it comes to mass immigration, rather than a temporary change,” the June 27 article stated: For as long as most of us can remember, business has been able to call on a ready supply of foreign workers. The giants of Silicon Valley, farmers and food processors, hotels and restaurants, housebuilders and megastores: All have dealt with labor shortages by recruiting immigrants. One result has been an astonishing demographic transformation: 16% of the British population, 20% of the Swedish population, 19% of the German population and 14.3% of the US population were born abroad. WATCH — WOW! Trump Admin Says There Were ZERO May Border Crossings: But public opinion is increasingly opposed to migration, so companies should revive their pre-migration efforts to train locals for new jobs instead of importing workers, Bloomberg recommended: Domestic supply chains have fallen into disrepair in recent decades, in part because both governments and employers have been able to turn to the easy option of importing immigrants. … Companies need to take a more prominent role in fixing domestic [labor] supply chains. Tap into the neglected pool of talent in working-class communities by sponsoring charter schools, endowing university scholarships or spotting and then sponsoring talented students. Improve vocational education by introducing apprenticeship programs or forging relationships with local high schools. Take a more prominent role in providing career guidance in local schools. Employ more unconventional workers such as older workers by introducing flexible working hours or extended holidays. Companies also must invest more in wealth-generating, labor-saving machines instead of exploiting the post-1990 bubble of government-supplied cheap migrant labor, Bloomberg added: This is particularly true of industries that now rely on imported labor such as construction, farming and hospitality. America’s postwar experiment with the factory-based production of houses proved to be a tremendous success, with the price of factory-made homes falling by two-thirds in 1955-73, before it was destroyed by a combination of construction unions and red tape. In agriculture, “intelligent” AI-powered machines can do things that were too delicate for dumb machines, such as nurturing seeds and controlling weeds. In hospitality, robots can do ever more delicate cleaning jobs. The Bloomberg article focused on blue-collar labor and did not spotlight the harm of migration on white-collar Americans. Still, Bloomberg is also posting a series of scoops about the H-1B labor inflow that is displacing many young Americans. Moreover, the Bloomberg article is more evidence that elite opinion is turning away from migration, largely because the establishment media are no longer able to hide the civic chaos, mass deaths and rapes, public anger, primitive ideologies, and economic damage caused by elites’ decision to sideline native populations in favor of the profits earned from foreign migrants. WATCH — ICE Arrests Over 80 Illegal Aliens Working at Louisiana Racetrack: “I used to subscribe to the near consensus among economists that immigration to the US was a good thing,” Professor Angus Deaton wrote in a March 2024 post for the International Monetary Fund. He continued: Longer-term analysis over the past century and a half tells a different story. Inequality was high when America was open [to migration], was much lower when the borders were closed [to migrants], and rose again post Hart-Celler (the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965) as the fraction of foreign-born people rose back to its levels in the Gilded Age. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology “If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard of living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations,” he said. But most business groups and establishment media sites remain pro-migration, regardless of the massive government failures and massive civic chaos that led to the reelection of President Donald Trump in 2024.

Title: The Rocket  Fueled: Bitcoin Supply Shock Incoming, Keiser Says

Time Published: 2025-06-29T16:39:01Z

Bitcoin appears to be tightening its grip on market attention once again—this time not because of price volatility, but due to a looming structural scarcity that some of the asset’s most vocal supporters say is unfolding in real time. Max Keiser, Bitcoin advocate and advisor to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, issued a clear statement on Tuesday, June 25, 2025, via his X account. “I’ve done the math. A Bitcoin supply shock is imminent,” Keiser posted, punctuating the forecast with a rocket emoji. The Bitcoin protocol permanently caps the total supply of Bitcoin (BTC) at 21 million coins. According to blockchain data, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoins have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created. That number is falling fast. This event, part of Bitcoin’s four-year issuance schedule, cut block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. As a result, the daily release of new coins dropped to approximately 450 BTC per day—down from around 900 before the halving. That drop in new supply arrives just as institutional demand shows no signs of easing. Since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, institutional entities have poured billions into the asset. Data from early 2025 shows that ETFs, particularly BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), have absorbed large volumes of BTC. As of June 2025, BlackRock leads all ETF issuers with substantial Bitcoin holdings, outpacing even Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, which now controls over 500,000 BTC. In January 2024 after the ETF approvals, Samson Mow warned of a double-edged market pressure: a supply shock from the halving and a demand shock from ETF buying. His view now seems to be taking shape. Mow and Keiser argue that market liquidity could dry up fast when these forces collide. Trading volumes also support the idea of a supply shock. On June 24, Bitcoin trading volume exceeded $3 billion in just one hour. Such spikes indicate growing participation from institutions and retail investors alike, especially during periods of market uncertainty. Bitcoin’s role as a potential store of value is also finding renewed interest amid global instability. The ongoing accumulation by large firms and new treasury entrants such as Metaplanet and ProCap BTC, recently co-founded by VC investor Anthony Pompliano, add weight to the notion that Bitcoin is becoming a preferred long-term asset. On June 25, 2025, Keiser’s remarks will be accompanied by a broader analysis of the changing dynamics in Bitcoin supply and demand. Analysts point to a structural shift—less Bitcoin is being created and more is locked away in institutional vaults. That imbalance already affects availability on exchanges, where reserves continue to drop. Keiser and Mow’s predictions are not new, but the timeline may tighten. With less than five million Bitcoin left to mine, and the next halving set for 2028—when block rewards will fall again to 1.5625 BTC—the pressure on circulating supply may continue to intensify. For now, the data shows demand rising while supply falls. Whether that translates to market movement remains to be seen. But Bitcoin’s architecture ensures one thing: the supply side will not expand. As of late June 2025, that’s no longer just a theoretical talking point—it’s becoming visible on the blockchain.

Title: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Register $2 Billion Inflows As Institutional Demand Surges – Details

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The US Bitcoin spot ETFs logged over $2 billion in net inflows last week, marking a three-week streak of positive momentum. Despite a bearish start to June, with $128.81 million in net outflows during the first trading week, investor appetite soon quickly rebounded. This turnaround has resulted in a cumulative $4.63 billion in deposits over the past three weeks. On Friday June 27, the 12 US Bitcoin ETFs registered net inflows of $501.27 million bringing the aggregate deposits of the last week to a staggering $2.22 billion. According to data from ETF tracking site SoSoValue, the clean streak of daily inflows from last week extends the ETFs’ positive performance to 14 consecutive days. In analyzing individual ETF data from this week, the BlackRock IBIT registered $1.31 billion in net deposits solidifying its position as the market’s unrivalled leader. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark/21 Shares’ ARKB also experienced substantial cumulative inflows of $504.40 million and $268.14 million, respectively. Grayscale’s BTC, VanEck’s HODL, Valkyrie’s BRRR, Invesco’s BTCO, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC also recorded moderate net flows ranging from $1million – $25 million. In familiar fashion, Grayscale’s GBTC produced the only net outflows losing $5.69 million in withdrawals, but still retains its position as the third largest Bitcoin ETF with $19.79 billion in net assets. Following this week, the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs have now recorded $4.50 billion in net flows in June signaling a resolute demand from institutional investors despite Bitcoin market troubles. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has witnessed extensive corrections since hitting a new all-time high of $111,790 on May 22. Over the last month, BTC has made no new price discovery trading largely between $100,000 and $110,000 to form a descending price channel. While this price performance reflects a neutral market sentiment, the high influx of capital into the Bitcoin ETFs signal a long-term confidence by institutional investors on Bitcoin’s price appreciation prospects. In other developments, SoSoValue data also reveals that US Ethereum Spot ETFs notched up a cumulative inflow of $283.41 million over the last week extending their positive streak to seven consecutive weeks. In June alone, these ETFs saw total inflows of $1.13 billion, marking their largest monthly gain in 2025. As of the time of writing, the total net assets of the Ethereum ETFs stand at $9.88 billion, accounting for 3.37% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, Ethereum continues to trade at $2,441 with Bitcoin prices set around $107,339. Semilore Faleti is a cryptocurrency writer specialized in the field of journalism and content creation.

Title: CEOs Are Quietly Telling Us the Truth: AI Is Replacing You

The fear is real. In meetings, Slack chats, and after-work drinks, one question is quietly eating away at millions of employees: Will AI take my job? In public, CEOs like to sound reassuring. They say generative AI will âenhance productivityâ or âstreamline operations.â But when you actually read what they’re telling their own employees, or what slips out in investor memos, the message is chilling: virtual workers are here, and theyâre not just assistants. Theyâre replacements. Letâs take a closer look at what some of the worldâs most powerful tech CEOs are saying. Not in hype videos, but in official internal messages, blog posts, and investor updates. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently published a company-wide message that sounds reasonable, until you actually read it. âAs we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today… We expect this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.â The key phrase? âNext few years.â Thatâs corporate speak for 2026 to 2028. Not ten years away. This is soon. Jassy is not talking about automating only simple or repetitive tasks. Heâs preparing employees for a reality where AI replaces entire job categories across the board, and where hiring slows or stops altogether for roles that machines can now do. In a memo posted to LinkedIn, Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn was even more blunt. âMost functions will have specific initiatives to fundamentally change how they work… Headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work.â Translation: No more hiring unless your job is impossible for AI to do. The company is betting that most teams will soon need fewer humans. Shopify CEO Tobi LÃ¼tke shared a similar directive on X: âBefore asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI… What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?â LÃ¼tke is openly asking managers to reimagine teams as if AI agents are already integrated, and to justify why any humans are still necessary. https://t.co/6i6h3sKi3x — tobi lutke (@tobi) April 7, 2025 The message from these CEOs is clear: human employees are now the last resort. The new default is automation. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently stated that AI is already doing 50% of the work within his company, shortly before announcing another 1,000 job cuts. The CEO of Klarna, a major fintech company, was even more blunt, revealing that AI has already allowed the company to reduce its workforce by 40%. These arenât future scenarios. This is already happening. The reason for this sudden shift is the rapid evolution of AI technology. As OpenAI CEO Sam Altman explained in a recent podcast, the latest “reasoning models” have made a critical leap. In simple terms, these AI systems can now do more than just find information; they can “think” through complex, multi-step problems. Altman suggested these models can reason on par with someone holding a PhD, meaning they are now capable of performing the high level analytical tasks once reserved for highly educated humans. This capability is being actively harnessed. Three sources working at major AI labs told Gizmodo that they are training powerful models to perform real world tasks in nearly every “knowledge work” profession, including banking, financial analysis, insurance, law, and even journalism. These sources, who requested anonymity as their contracts prohibit them from speaking publicly, described how their work is used in side by side comparisons with AI models to refine the technology until it can produce professional grade output with minimal errors. Virtual employees are already doing our jobs; the current phase is simply about making them more perfect. The “next few years” Jassy spoke of may be closer to two years at most. Consider the tech industry’s recent layoff trends. In 2024, 551 tech companies laid off nearly 152,922 employees, according to data from Layoff.fyi. The pace has accelerated dramatically this year. In just the first six months of 2025, 151 tech companies have already laid off over 63,823 people. On average a tech company cut 277 workers in 2024. If that rate is maintained for the rest of the year, the average number of layoffs per tech company in 2025 would soar to 851, roughly three times the 2024 average. While there is no direct evidence linking all these layoffs to AI, the trend is happening during a period of record economic strength. The Nasdaq just closed at an all time high, and eight of the world’s ten largest companies are in the tech sector. Profitable, growing companies are shedding workers at an alarming rate, and the quiet implementation of AI is the most logical explanation. Tech CEOs wonât tell you outright that youâre being replaced. But the memos speak for themselves. AI is already here, and your company is likely building a roadmap to automate you out of your role. One internal pilot project at a time. One chatbot at a time. One hiring freeze at a time. If you want to understand whatâs next for the American workforce, donât listen to the marketing. Read the footnotes in the CEOâs blog. Because theyâre already telling you the truth.

In a sweeping conversation with Bernie Sanders about AI and automation threatening jobs, the world's biggest podcaster used an unnamed TikTok video to make a surprisingly powerful case for worker rights.

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/29/2025 8:09:19 AM PDT by RandFan The Senate has removed a controversial provision from its megabill that would have sold off hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who was leading the push on the measure, announced late Saturday that the measure would be stripped from the bill. “Because of the strict constraints of the budget reconciliation process, I was unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families – not to China, not to Blackrock and not to any foreign interests,” Lee said in a post on X. “For that reason, I’ve decided to withdraw the federal land sales provision from the bill,” he added. Lee had initially proposed selling off between 2.2 million and 3.3 million acres of public lands. After that proposal was rejected by the Senate parliamentarian, he put forward a new measure that would have sold off between 600,000 and 1.2 million acres. But, the Utah Republican indicated in his post on Saturday that he would work with President Trump to find uses for what he described as “underutilized” lands. “President Trump promised to put underutilized federal land to work for American families, and I look forward to helping him achieve that in a way that respects the legacy of our public lands and reflects the values of people who use them most,” he wrote. While the measure had some GOP support, it also received pushback from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. (Excerpt) Read more at thehill.com ...

Since taxpayer money was used to buy these lands in the first place, it is long due to repay that debt. Since the original taxpayers who footed the bill for the Louisiana Purchase (1803), the Onis Treaty (1819), the Treaty of Guadeloupe (1848), Gadsden Purchase (1854), Alaska Purchase (1867) are long dead, perhaps repayment can be made to their descendants. We can devise a lottery of Federal land. Anyone who can prove they are the direct descendant of an American resident or Native American tribe prior to 1867 gets one lottery share for a land division in Alaska. If your ancestors were here prior to 1854 you also get a lottery share for land in the Gadsen Purchase region, prior to 1848 and you also get a lottery share for Treaty of Guadeloupe land, prior to 1819 and you’re in the running for Onis Treaty land. If your direct ancestors were here before 1803 you get a lottery share for Louisiana Purchase land in addition to all the other lotteries. Each lottery would be for random but similar plots of Federally owned surplus land in a particular lottery location. Once drawn, the land is yours to develop or sell (after a reasonable waiting period). You (the new owner) of course would be responsible for any applicable property taxes or hazardous materials remediation costs (e.g. abandoned mine clean ups). Sorry but if your direct ancestors came here after 1867, you do not qualify for any of the lotteries but you could purchase land from a lottery winner once their mandatory holding period has expired. 20 posted on 06/29/2025 4:24:10 PM PDT by XRdsRev (Justice for Bernell Trammell, black Trump supporter, executed in the street in broad daylight 2020.a) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-31 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Since taxpayer money was used to buy these lands in the first place, it is long due to repay that debt. Since the original taxpayers who footed the bill for the Louisiana Purchase (1803), the Onis Treaty (1819), the Treaty of Guadeloupe (1848), Gadsden Purchase (1854), Alaska Purchase (1867) are long dead, perhaps repayment can be made to their descendants. We can devise a lottery of Federal land. Anyone who can prove they are the direct descendant of an American resident or Native American tribe prior to 1867 gets one lottery share for a land division in Alaska. If your ancestors were here prior to 1854 you also get a lottery share for land in the Gadsen Purchase region, prior to 1848 and you also get a lottery share for Treaty of Guadeloupe land, prior to 1819 and you’re in the running for Onis Treaty land. If your direct ancestors were here before 1803 you get a lottery share for Louisiana Purchase land in addition to all the other lotteries. Each lottery would be for random but similar plots of Federally owned surplus land in a particular lottery location. Once drawn, the land is yours to develop or sell (after a reasonable waiting period). You (the new owner) of course would be responsible for any applicable property taxes or hazardous materials remediation costs (e.g. abandoned mine clean ups). Sorry but if your direct ancestors came here after 1867, you do not qualify for any of the lotteries but you could purchase land from a lottery winner once their mandatory holding period has expired. 20 posted on 06/29/2025 4:24:10 PM PDT by XRdsRev (Justice for Bernell Trammell, black Trump supporter, executed in the street in broad daylight 2020.a) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-31 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Since taxpayer money was used to buy these lands in the first place, it is long due to repay that debt. Since the original taxpayers who footed the bill for the Louisiana Purchase (1803), the Onis Treaty (1819), the Treaty of Guadeloupe (1848), Gadsden Purchase (1854), Alaska Purchase (1867) are long dead, perhaps repayment can be made to their descendants. We can devise a lottery of Federal land. Anyone who can prove they are the direct descendant of an American resident or Native American tribe prior to 1867 gets one lottery share for a land division in Alaska. If your ancestors were here prior to 1854 you also get a lottery share for land in the Gadsen Purchase region, prior to 1848 and you also get a lottery share for Treaty of Guadeloupe land, prior to 1819 and you’re in the running for Onis Treaty land. If your direct ancestors were here before 1803 you get a lottery share for Louisiana Purchase land in addition to all the other lotteries. Each lottery would be for random but similar plots of Federally owned surplus land in a particular lottery location. Once drawn, the land is yours to develop or sell (after a reasonable waiting period). You (the new owner) of course would be responsible for any applicable property taxes or hazardous materials remediation costs (e.g. abandoned mine clean ups). Sorry but if your direct ancestors came here after 1867, you do not qualify for any of the lotteries but you could purchase land from a lottery winner once their mandatory holding period has expired. 20 posted on 06/29/2025 4:24:10 PM PDT by XRdsRev (Justice for Bernell Trammell, black Trump supporter, executed in the street in broad daylight 2020.a) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-31 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

The only exception to federal ownership of state lands is a mandatory process to purchase state lands for "needful buildings" (US Const., Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 17). The only exception to federal ownership of state lands is a mandatory process to purchase state lands for "needful buildings" (US Const., Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 17). Democrats for the most part would not want any Federal land sold to private interest. Those on both sides that are in the pockets of Blackrock and/or the CCP would not want any restriction on who the land was sold to, because the want the government to get the maximum benefit from the sale.

On the upside I did see that Trump has cancelled the "No Roads" on US Forest Land in the interest of forest management. Sometimes you have to vote for something you don't like because the alternative of having nothing is worse. That's true today, and it was true when McCarthy was Speaker. The people and members can b*tch and scream about what the country needs, and they may well be correct, but the math and makeup of Congress imposes limits that can't be ignored in terms of what is possible. Want a different bill, elect a different Congress. Want a different bill, elect a different Congress. It is also noteworthy the percentage of the US land that is owned by the government. The bill would have destroyed the cattle industry which depends on free range grazing on public lands. “these lands would be sold only to American families – not to China, not to Blackrock and not to any foreign interests” the fact that they could not get that stipulation into the bill tells you the kind of corruption has taken root in the process. There need to be provisions such as you can only buy 1 acre and you need to establish residency on that plot of land. That would keep Blackrock, the Chicoms and Bill Gates away. Yes it would limit how much is sold and how quickly it is sold, but it would keep that land out of the hands of the above which is the whole point. The federal government owns a ridiculous amount of land in the west. It stifles the growth of those states and makes home prices artificially high. In addition to the above, it would generate good revenue for the federal treasury to sell some land. Land sales used to be a nice 10% or so of federal revenues per year. Typical of DC. Take an important bill and add lots of extra stuff to buy off certain Congress critters. If it’s s so important, it will stand on it’s own, later. New York State has the highest percentage of state owned land in the nation. What is the reason for this? I don’t think anything in New York is desert, barron rock or swamps like in some states THE FEDS CONTROL THE LAND-—BUT IF THEY OWN IT-—WHERE IS THE PROPERTY TAX PAID TO EACH STATE??? THEY PAY ZERO. THE NUMBERS SHOWN FOR NEVADA & UTAH ARE UNDER STATED FEDS-—CONTROL-—THEY DO NOT OWN. THEY NEVER PAY A DIME IN PROPERTY TAXES I can imagine the real motive is hidden behind that statement, but that is good enough for me to rid the bill of the provision. Sales should be to American ranchers and farmers. The feds unconstitutionally took those lands and should in turn GIVE the states those lands within their boundaries. Period. Good. Concentrate on better management and stewardship and a plan to return lands to state control (if that is what a state wants.) Thanks for pointing that out. Kind of surprised the greenies did not go for this part of the bill in their goal of ending beef consumption. That does make sense. When a state was incorporated it should have received all the lands within its boundaries. The Federal Government owned the land before the states even existed. Those lands were generally paid for by US taxpayers. If the states want those lands, let them buy them from the Federal government. Most of these states have been happy letting the Federal government pay the $$$$ to maintain, administer and clean up those lands for the better part of their existence. No free land for those states, make them pay for it. If we are going to give it away, give it to the Indians, it was their land first. some are so interested in having the Federal government divest it’s land holdings out west, Here is an idea….. Since taxpayer money was used to buy these lands in the first place, it is long due to repay that debt. Since the original taxpayers who footed the bill for the Louisiana Purchase (1803), the Onis Treaty (1819), the Treaty of Guadeloupe (1848), Gadsden Purchase (1854), Alaska Purchase (1867) are long dead, perhaps repayment can be made to their descendants. We can devise a lottery of Federal land. Anyone who can prove they are the direct descendant of an American resident or Native American tribe prior to 1867 gets one lottery share for a land division in Alaska. If your ancestors were here prior to 1854 you also get a lottery share for land in the Gadsen Purchase region, prior to 1848 and you also get a lottery share for Treaty of Guadeloupe land, prior to 1819 and you’re in the running for Onis Treaty land. If your direct ancestors were here before 1803 you get a lottery share for Louisiana Purchase land in addition to all the other lotteries. Each lottery would be for random but similar plots of Federally owned surplus land in a particular lottery location. Once drawn, the land is yours to develop or sell (after a reasonable waiting period). You (the new owner) of course would be responsible for any applicable property taxes or hazardous materials remediation costs (e.g. abandoned mine clean ups). Sorry but if your direct ancestors came here after 1867, you do not qualify for any of the lotteries but you could purchase land from a lottery winner once their mandatory holding period has expired.

Strategy Inc., the company once known as MicroStrategy, is now at the center of at least five class‑action lawsuits. Investors claim the firm hid big risks tied to its Bitcoin holdings and painted a rosier picture than what was real. The lawsuits hinge on about $6 billion in unrealized losses and cover an 11‑month stretch from April 2024 through April 2025. According to filings, the complaints say executives made untrue and misleading statements about Bitcoin’s ups and downs and an accounting change that forces the company to mark its crypto to market. One lead plaintiff, Abhey Parmar, insists that top officers breached their duties and oversold the company’s outlook. Based on reports, law firms are already bidding to lead these actions—the kind of scramble you see when big money is at stake. Strategy is facing at least five class action lawsuits alleging securities fraud due to $6 billion in unrealized BTC losses. The lawsuits accuse the firm of misleading investors about Bitcoin risks and profitability. Legal experts say such competing filings are common as firms… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 27, 2025 Investors point to trades by new CEO Phong Le and CFO Andrew Kang as proof of inside dealing. They sold about $32 million in stock just before the public disclosure of the accounting shift. Lawyers say that timing raises questions about whether executives knew how badly the mark‑to‑market losses would hit the books. If they held back material facts until after their trades, that could stiffen the case. In April, Strategy warned shareholders it wouldn’t break even in Q1 because of those same unrealized Bitcoin losses. The firm reported a loss of $16.49 per share and cautioned it might not turn a profit soon. That announcement triggered the first suit—filed on May 16 by Pomerantz LLP—and prompted follow‑ons from Gross Law Firm; Bronstein Gewirtz & Grossman; Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check; and Levi & Korsinsky. Despite the courtroom drama, the stock is up nearly 30% so far this year. Strategy now holds 592,345 BTC, with a total market value north of $63 billion. The firm bought its Bitcoin at an average of $70,702 per coin, and today they trade around $106,824—an unrealized gain of about $21.3 billion, or roughly 50%. Those figures help explain why investors have stuck with the plan. Based on the latest SEC filings, founder Michael Saylor is the biggest holder, with close to 20 million shares—worth almost $8 billion at $389.50 per share. Other big names include Vanguard at 8.55%, BlackRock at 5.80%, Capital International Investors at 5.80%, Susquehanna Securities at 4.82%, and Jane Street Group at 4.70%. Strategy’s stock trades near $393.24, valuing the company at about $107.50 billion—a 1.67x premium over its net asset value.

Title: Mid-Year Outlook: Stocks Back At Highs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/06/29/mid-year-outlook-stocks-back-at-highs/
Time Published: 2025-06-29T11:00:00Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. With stocks reaching a new high just as the midpoint of the year is reached, it is an opportune time ... More to look at what the second half of the year might hold. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The boost from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies was also notably in the rebound. With stocks reaching a new high just as the midpoint of the year is reached, it is an opportune time to look at what the second half of the year might hold. Rather than the traditional outlook, this will be an examination of the risks versus rewards, considering what is currently priced in financial markets. The massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%, with stocks dragged lower in expectation of lower earnings. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The recent 12-day military conflict between Israel and Iran caused concerns about an economically unfriendly oil shock. Still, the US bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities has led to a ceasefire, which has cooled fears. Stocks & Recession Odds The betting odds of recession also tell much of the story about the US 10-year Treasury note yield. Yields fell as fears of an economic downturn rose and have since recovered from the lows, as economic risk appears to have waned. There is more to the story here, as signs suggest that bond markets worldwide are less willing to fund the unfavorable fiscal situations of most countries. Yields & Recession Odds Stocks soared last week on the ceasefire in the Israel-Iran war and the agreement around a framework for US-China trade. The S&P 500 surpassed its mid-February high by 0.5% after having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 4% below its mid-December level after being as much as 30% under the peak. Apart from the good news on trade and Iran, the strength in US bank stocks was notable. Last week, the annual Federal Reserve (Fed) stress tests for large banks were better than expected. Additionally, the Fed made some changes to the methodology, which are expected to result in fewer Stress Capital Buffers (SCBs) being required for banks in the future. All other things being equal, less need for capital buffers means better profitability. Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed less economically impacted defensives since stocks bottomed, marking the peak of recession fears. The current situation is back to pricing in a benign, if not downright optimistic, economic backdrop. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Based on the current 24.3 times current earnings and 23.4 times multiple of 2025 estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies generate profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Although the ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average, which argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable. Consensus estimates project a return on equity of 18.6% in 2025 and 19.4% in 2026, up from 17.6% in 2024. To provide perspective, the S&P 500’s ROE was 15.1% in 2019 before the pandemic. S&P 500: Price-To-Earnings & ROE The composition of the large-cap US stock market is crucial to this improved outlook for ROE since much of the boost has come from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Even a simple analysis of the S&P 500 shows that at least 43% of the market capitalization is related to these two areas. Weights In S&P 500 As noted earlier, the exceptional return on equity supports the rich stock valuations, and profit margins are elevated relative to historical levels. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that are converted into bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are almost twice the market. In addition, according to FactSet, technology sector earnings are expected to grow at 18% in 2025, while the S&P 500’s earnings are forecast to rise by about 9.1% year-over-year. S&P 500: Profitability According to Warren Buffett, “The value of a business is the cash it’s going to produce in the future, discounted back to the present.” Free cash flow measures the cash left over after a company supports its operations and maintains or invests further in its business. Thus, free cash flow provides a good measure of the money accruing to shareholders as owners. The free cash flow yield is calculated by dividing the free cash flow by the stock price. Consistent with the price-to-earnings ratio, the cash flow yield suggests that the stock market is not currently cheap, although it has been more expensive at times in the past. This metric assumes that free cash flow remains static, so it can also be interpreted as indicating that investors have more confidence that free cash flow will continue to grow. Indeed, investors should be willing to pay more for a company in which one can have high confidence that the corporate profits accruing to owners will continue to grow. As a subset of the S&P 500, technology stocks are priced at an even lower free cash flow yield. This valuation premium reflects the optimism about the future of many of these companies and the superior fundamentals of the group as a whole. The profit margins and earnings growth rate for the technology sector have been exceptional, which helps explain the premium valuation assigned by the lower free cash flow yield. One additional wrinkle is the massive capital spending (capex) that Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are investing in artificial intelligence infrastructure. This spending is also depressing the current free cash flow yield for the technology-related stocks on the margin. Massive capital expenditure (capex) spending is often viewed as a red flag for investors, who are typically concerned that the substantial investment will not yield a sufficient return for the companies. However, these four companies are currently being given the benefit of the doubt. S&P 500: Free Cash Flow Yield The main event of the holiday-shortened trading week will be the monthly jobs report on Thursday. Economists expect June’s gain in nonfarm payrolls to slow to 113,000 from 139,000 in May. Notably, the unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.3% from 4.2%. US Unemployment Rate Given the upward trend in weekly continuing claims for unemployment benefits, the expected uptick in unemployment is a reasonable assumption. The upward trend indicates that the job market has been softening as it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to get a new one. With expectations for the US economy rebounding and the risk of recession decreasing, the resilience of the labor market should be closely monitored. Continuing Claims For Unemployment Benefits Markets currently expect at least two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is a slight chance of a cut in July, but the first move lower in 2025 is fully priced for September. Fed Rate Cuts Expected In the wake of the rebound from the tariff-induced bear market decline in stocks, investors should revisit their risk tolerance, as the robust stock rally over the last couple of years has likely increased their allocation to risk assets. Rebalancing stock and bond allocations toward the target risk level is wise for many investors, especially given the ongoing presence of tariff, geopolitical, and fiscal risks. The key to successful long-term stock investing is staying invested during the inevitable tough times, as rebounds from those bear markets are typically massive and unpredictable in timing, as illustrated by the first half of this year. Stocks are priced for a benign economic outcome and some support from the Federal Reserve in lowering interest rates. Improving corporate profitability, with 9% earnings growth in 2025 and 14% in 2026, is forecasted to normalize currently elevated valuations. This outcome is certainly possible, if not the most probable, but investors should be mindful that the hurdles at these valuation levels are higher. The artificial intelligence wave is a real phenomenon as adoption continues, so the optimistic scenario is not entirely out of the realm of possibility. This optimism should be tempered by the fact that the economy and earnings can always disappoint, especially if the trade war heats up again; therefore, investors should be prepared for possible turbulence.

Rather than the traditional outlook, this will be an examination of the risks versus rewards, considering what is currently priced in financial markets. The massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%, with stocks dragged lower in expectation of lower earnings. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The recent 12-day military conflict between Israel and Iran caused concerns about an economically unfriendly oil shock. Still, the US bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities has led to a ceasefire, which has cooled fears. Stocks & Recession Odds The betting odds of recession also tell much of the story about the US 10-year Treasury note yield. Yields fell as fears of an economic downturn rose and have since recovered from the lows, as economic risk appears to have waned. There is more to the story here, as signs suggest that bond markets worldwide are less willing to fund the unfavorable fiscal situations of most countries. Yields & Recession Odds Stocks soared last week on the ceasefire in the Israel-Iran war and the agreement around a framework for US-China trade. The S&P 500 surpassed its mid-February high by 0.5% after having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 4% below its mid-December level after being as much as 30% under the peak. Apart from the good news on trade and Iran, the strength in US bank stocks was notable. Last week, the annual Federal Reserve (Fed) stress tests for large banks were better than expected. Additionally, the Fed made some changes to the methodology, which are expected to result in fewer Stress Capital Buffers (SCBs) being required for banks in the future. All other things being equal, less need for capital buffers means better profitability. Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed less economically impacted defensives since stocks bottomed, marking the peak of recession fears. The current situation is back to pricing in a benign, if not downright optimistic, economic backdrop. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Based on the current 24.3 times current earnings and 23.4 times multiple of 2025 estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies generate profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Although the ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average, which argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable. Consensus estimates project a return on equity of 18.6% in 2025 and 19.4% in 2026, up from 17.6% in 2024. To provide perspective, the S&P 500’s ROE was 15.1% in 2019 before the pandemic. S&P 500: Price-To-Earnings & ROE The composition of the large-cap US stock market is crucial to this improved outlook for ROE since much of the boost has come from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Even a simple analysis of the S&P 500 shows that at least 43% of the market capitalization is related to these two areas. Weights In S&P 500 As noted earlier, the exceptional return on equity supports the rich stock valuations, and profit margins are elevated relative to historical levels. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that are converted into bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are almost twice the market. In addition, according to FactSet, technology sector earnings are expected to grow at 18% in 2025, while the S&P 500’s earnings are forecast to rise by about 9.1% year-over-year. S&P 500: Profitability According to Warren Buffett, “The value of a business is the cash it’s going to produce in the future, discounted back to the present.” Free cash flow measures the cash left over after a company supports its operations and maintains or invests further in its business. Thus, free cash flow provides a good measure of the money accruing to shareholders as owners. The free cash flow yield is calculated by dividing the free cash flow by the stock price. Consistent with the price-to-earnings ratio, the cash flow yield suggests that the stock market is not currently cheap, although it has been more expensive at times in the past. This metric assumes that free cash flow remains static, so it can also be interpreted as indicating that investors have more confidence that free cash flow will continue to grow. Indeed, investors should be willing to pay more for a company in which one can have high confidence that the corporate profits accruing to owners will continue to grow. As a subset of the S&P 500, technology stocks are priced at an even lower free cash flow yield. This valuation premium reflects the optimism about the future of many of these companies and the superior fundamentals of the group as a whole. The profit margins and earnings growth rate for the technology sector have been exceptional, which helps explain the premium valuation assigned by the lower free cash flow yield. One additional wrinkle is the massive capital spending (capex) that Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are investing in artificial intelligence infrastructure. This spending is also depressing the current free cash flow yield for the technology-related stocks on the margin. Massive capital expenditure (capex) spending is often viewed as a red flag for investors, who are typically concerned that the substantial investment will not yield a sufficient return for the companies. However, these four companies are currently being given the benefit of the doubt. S&P 500: Free Cash Flow Yield The main event of the holiday-shortened trading week will be the monthly jobs report on Thursday. Economists expect June’s gain in nonfarm payrolls to slow to 113,000 from 139,000 in May. Notably, the unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.3% from 4.2%. US Unemployment Rate Given the upward trend in weekly continuing claims for unemployment benefits, the expected uptick in unemployment is a reasonable assumption. The upward trend indicates that the job market has been softening as it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to get a new one. With expectations for the US economy rebounding and the risk of recession decreasing, the resilience of the labor market should be closely monitored. Continuing Claims For Unemployment Benefits Markets currently expect at least two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is a slight chance of a cut in July, but the first move lower in 2025 is fully priced for September. Fed Rate Cuts Expected In the wake of the rebound from the tariff-induced bear market decline in stocks, investors should revisit their risk tolerance, as the robust stock rally over the last couple of years has likely increased their allocation to risk assets. Rebalancing stock and bond allocations toward the target risk level is wise for many investors, especially given the ongoing presence of tariff, geopolitical, and fiscal risks. The key to successful long-term stock investing is staying invested during the inevitable tough times, as rebounds from those bear markets are typically massive and unpredictable in timing, as illustrated by the first half of this year. Stocks are priced for a benign economic outcome and some support from the Federal Reserve in lowering interest rates. Improving corporate profitability, with 9% earnings growth in 2025 and 14% in 2026, is forecasted to normalize currently elevated valuations. This outcome is certainly possible, if not the most probable, but investors should be mindful that the hurdles at these valuation levels are higher. The artificial intelligence wave is a real phenomenon as adoption continues, so the optimistic scenario is not entirely out of the realm of possibility. This optimism should be tempered by the fact that the economy and earnings can always disappoint, especially if the trade war heats up again; therefore, investors should be prepared for possible turbulence.

Title: Banking Giant Goldman Sachs Adds One Asset to ‘Conviction Buy’ List After Raising Price Target: Report

US banking titan Goldman Sachs is reportedly highlighting its bullishness on one under-the-radar artificial intelligence (AI) stock that’s up over 68% since March. Goldman has put Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TWSC:2330) on its “Conviction Buy” list after already being on its buy list, Insider Monkey reports. TSMC is Taiwan’s largest company, and shares of TSMC are often considered a “pure play” on semiconductors as the firm manufactures chips for some of the world’s biggest tech firms, including Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm. Goldman says it is raising its price target on TSMC based on cooling concerns about large AI-chip order cuts and increasing demand for the company’s CoWoS (Chip on Wafer on Substrate with silicon interposer) tech designed to power ultra-high-performance computing for AI and other applications. The bank also believes that more smartphone, server and networking customers of TSMC will start adopting CoWoS tech. Goldman is projecting the company’s dollar revenue to grow by 29% this year and 17% in 2026. The firm has upped its price target for TSM to NT$1,210 from NT$1,145. At time of writing, TSMC is trading at NT$1,080. Reaching Goldman’s price target suggests a 12% rally from current prices.

Facing overwhelming opposition from all Democrats and a growing number in his own party, Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee tonight withdrew his proposal to sell millions of acres of public land to help balance the federal budget. In a statement issued by his office, Lee said that because of the “strict constraints of the budget reconciliation process, I was unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families — not to China, not to BlackRock, and not to any foreign interests. For that reason I’ve made the decision to withdraw the federal land sales provision from the bill.” Lee’s language, a central part of the omnibus federal budget bill, would have put more than a million acres of BLM land on the auction block starting later this year. Senate leaders, hurriedly working to get the budget to a floor vote this weekend, gave Lee the opportunity to pull his provision, pages 202 to 211 of the thousand-page Big Beautiful Bill, knowing that it would have faced certain defeat by the Republican-majority Senate. That language would have forced the sale of BLM land in 11 Western states to offset tax cuts and royalty rebates to gas and oil drillers. The language in those pages, sponsored and revised over the last two weeks by Lee, would have created the largest disposal of public land since the Homestead Act. Tens of thousands of hunters, anglers, hikers, and public-land recreationists have pummeled the offices of their congressional delegations with increasingly strident demands to kill Lee’s bill. That continued pressure from a broad and vocal coalition of rural hunters, suburban hikers, livestock producers, Main Street business owners, anglers, dirtbag climbers, and whitewater rafters made the difference, says Montanan Randy Newberg, host of Fresh Tracks and a vocal public-land advocate. “Mike Lee did something that we’ve not been able to do, to have all Americans become focused on one issue, no partisanship, no Rs, no Ds, and in the process I hope they have sent a message that public lands are that third rail of American politics,” says Newberg, one of several social-media personalities who rallied his audience around defending public lands. “I think you could also say the same of the Senate, they put partisanship aside to kill this bad idea.” Newberg singled out the work of New Mexico Democrat Martin Heinrich for his ability to keep all Democrats aligned on killing Lee’s bill, and working across the aisle to convince fellow Western Republicans that it was bad for their constituents. While calls for the removal of the land-sale language from the mega bill was nearly unanimous, Lee kept digging in, making revisions that increased the amount of land that could be sold and adding vague language that seemed to stray from what he said was his intention: to allow Western municipalities to buy surrounding federal land in order to grow and build affordable housing for their residents. But in the most recent iteration, released by Lee’s office last night in order to satisfy the Senate’s budgetary rules, the highest priority for would-be disposed BLM lands was their appraised value. That highly valued land would likely have been bought by amenity purchasers, not cash-strapped Western cities. By adding lands with unallocated subsurface mineral rights to the total, the latest draft of the bill alarmed conservationists —— as much as 3 million acres of BLM land might have been available for sale to private industries, speculators, and even foreign governments. The Senate’s budget reconciliation process allows the omnibus budget package to pass by a simple majority. Republicans have only a 3-seat majority in both the Senate and House, but four Western Republicans had indicated they wouldn’t support the budget bill if it contained Lee’s land sales provision. Sources report that the roster of Republicans quietly in opposition to the measure was large and growing, causing the Senate leadership to strike Lee’s language in order to move the rest of the Big Beautiful Bill, which among other things could make tax cuts permanent for the wealthiest Americans and also includes cuts to Medicaid, public-lands management agencies, and federal reimbursements to rural hospitals. The Senate’s death blow to Lee’s bill removes pressure on the House of Representatives to kill the language. The House had been considered the “backwall” in efforts to make sure the land-sale provision didn’t advance to President Trump, who had indicated strong support for the proposal.

The building projects both power and exclusion. For most of the twentieth century it was the administrative seat of the former Panama Canal Zone, a US enclave to which most Panamanians were denied access. The canal—one of the infrastructural marvels of the twentieth century and a crucial artery of global trade—became the epicenter of US power in Latin America when Teddy Roosevelt secured control of its surrounding territory in 1903. It retained that distinction for nearly three quarters of a century, until Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama’s military leader, Omar Torrijos, that gradually ceded the Canal Zone to the Republic of Panama. The cession was to be completed by 12:00 PM on that December day in 1999. When the morning arrived, heavy rains drenched the isthmus, but a sea of people turned out all the same. At the strike of noon the crowd rushed up the hill to the Administration Building, waving Panama’s tricolor flag. “The canal is ours,” Panama’s president, Mireya Moscoso, proclaimed from atop the stairs. That celebration echoed this past December, when hundreds of people gathered at the Administration Building to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the end of the canal transition. The Panama Canal Authority, the semiautonomous entity that has overseen the maritime passage since 1997, placed a plaque on the front of the structure commemorating the achievement, which many in Panama and across the hemisphere consider a triumph of Latin American self-determination in the face of centuries of US hegemony. The festivities were not without anxiety. A week earlier, at an event hosted by the right-wing nonprofit Turning Point USA, then–president elect Donald Trump proclaimed that the US was being “ripped off at the Panama Canal”—presumably a reference to the tolls that container ships pay to traverse the passage. Trump complemented the speech with a series of posts on his social media platform, Truth Social, alleging that China was running the waterway and announcing that, consequently, the US would be taking it back. The comments sent shockwaves through Panama. President José Raúl Mulino flatly rejected them, asserting the country’s “nonnegotiable” sovereignty over the passage and insisting that “every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjoining zone is Panama’s and will remain so.” But even as Panamanian society recoiled at Trump’s rhetoric, other sectors saw an opportunity for vindication. When Carter negotiated the Panama Canal Treaties in 1977, he met stiff resistance from the Zonians, US citizens whose families had lived in the Canal Zone for generations, running the waterway and maintaining the slice of middle-class American society that cropped up around it. Carter is effectively a national hero in Panama, but many of the Zonians have long considered him an enemy. “I just hope Jimmy Carter stays alive long enough to see Trump take back the Panama Canal,” one participant posted in a Zonian group on Facebook after Trump’s initial provocations. Carter died that same week. Even amid the funeral rites, Trump continued to disparage Carter’s cession of the US colonial enclave in Panama as “a very big mistake.” For the Panamanians who showed up at the Administration Building on December 31, such language was deeply alarming. But it held an appeal for some of the Zonians, who recall the canal transition as a personal epic of paradise lost. Demostenes Angel/AFP/Getty Images Demonstrators gathering at the Panama Canal’s Administration Building to celebrate the waterway’s final handover to Panamanian control, Panama City, December 31, 1999 At the time of the treaty negotiations, many Zonians rallied behind the burgeoning neoconservative movement, donating to right-wing politicians and collaborating with organizations like the American Conservative Union and the Heritage Foundation—the latter going on to design Project 2025, the policy playbook that has informed much of the second Trump administration’s governance.1 By ceding the canal, they thought, Carter had demonstrated a weakness that, as the arch-conversative Republican senator from North Carolina Jesse Helms warned at the time, “could literally destroy America.” Bound to the Zonians’ plight, then, was the question of America’s global standing. The US’s decline from its postwar grandeur has many causes, but for the Zonians and Trump alike, some answers might be found on the isthmus of Panama. * In 1903 Teddy Roosevelt sought rights to construct a sea-level canal across Panama, then a province of Colombia. When Bogotá refused, he pivoted to Panama’s oligarchy, which had repeatedly agitated for independence over the course of the nineteenth century. Roosevelt promised to recognize and defend the new Panamanian nation, with his gunboats if necessary; in exchange the Panamanian elite gave Washington control over a ten-mile-wide stretch of territory that would encompass the canal. The agreement was enshrined in the 1903 Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty, which leased US rights to the territory “in perpetuity.” In November of that year, Washington gained the Canal Zone and Panama gained nationhood in one stroke. Advertisement The task of excavating the canal brought tens of thousands of workers from around the world: European and Chinese émigrés, migrants from surrounding Latin American countries, West Indian laborers seeking opportunity in the face of the stagnation then plaguing former plantation slavery economies. Among the “ditch diggers” were thousands of white US citizens (the hiring of Black US citizens during the construction period was limited), hailing from all corners of the country but especially from northeastern and midwestern industrial centers like New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The meaning of the term “Zonian” has evolved in the past half-century: depending on whom you ask, it could refer to military personnel stationed in one of the fourteen US military bases that once lined the canal, or to US civilians who moved to the Zone over the mid-twentieth century to work for the Panama Canal Company. But in its most restrictive use the term applies to the white US canal builders and their descendants. The first generation of Zonians came from a range of backgrounds—some were engineers, others manual laborers—yet all found themselves on a preferential end of a system of Jim Crow–style segregation that the US exported to the isthmus in the early twentieth century.2 At the base of that system was a two-tiered wage hierarchy. White laborers got paid in gold American dollars (the “gold roll”) whereas other laborers, largely West Indian and Panamanian, got paid in local coin, typically Colombian silver pesos (the “silver roll”). That distinction, in turn, shaped the rest of economic and social life: there were gold towns and silver towns, gold schools and silver schools, movie theaters, recreation areas, drinking fountains, and so on. The Isthmian Canal Commission, the administration overseeing the canal’s construction, claimed to be distinguishing merely between “skilled” and “unskilled” workers, but many gold and silver positions demanded identical responsibilities and duties. A “gold-roller” could make somewhere between two to four times as much as a “silver-roller” for effectively the same job. Otis Historical Archives/Wikimedia Commons A hand-tinted lantern slide of Spanish laborers working on the construction of the Panama Canal, circa early 1900s This system of segregation drew on some of the mechanisms of Jim Crow, as well as its animating spirit, but was complicated by the international setting of the Zone. To preserve white Americans’ primacy, race was “mapped onto nationality,” as the historian Rebecca Herman has written.3 To be American was, in effect, to be white; by extension, “to be a non-U.S. citizen was to be defined as non-white.” European canal builders and white Latinos were relegated to the silver roll; Black US citizens had been restricted precisely because they complicated the logic of the gold–silver hierarchy. By the 1930s some twenty worked civilian jobs in the Zone, almost all of them on the silver roll. The Canal Zone Government didn’t, moreover, extend birthright citizenship to children born to non-US citizens in the Zone, ensuring that even babies born in the Zone’s Gorgas hospital would be denied gold-roll status unless their parents were US citizens. In 1948, to accord with the Truman administration’s civil rights reforms, the Canal Zone administration changed the dual payment system from gold and silver to “US-rate” and “local-rate” (or in some instances “Latin American” rate). A 1955 bilateral agreement prompted lukewarm efforts to unify the wage system, but the Zone’s personnel bureau largely ignored the mandate. By 1961 only 240 Panamanians received US-rate wages, and the discrepancy between the two schedules persisted at a rate of four to one. It would not be until December 1977, two years before the implementation of the treaty and twenty-three years after the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, that the Zone’s last segregated “Latin American” school would officially close.4 * As the century progressed, successive Panamanian administrations sought to reclaim the Zone, forging a series of new bilateral agreements that modified but never annulled the 1903 treaty. By midcentury, nationalist sentiment boiled over into a series of violent clashes between Panamanian citizens and the Zone’s military and civilian populations. Perhaps the most significant occurred on January 9, 1964, when a group of Panamanian students marched into the Canal Zone and attempted to raise a Panamanian flag outside the enclave’s Balboa High School. Their efforts were met with violence, first from the Zone’s residents and police force and then from the US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM)—the arm of the US Department of Defense headquartered in the Canal Zone. The confrontation ignited widespread riots that left three hundred people wounded and two dozen dead. Advertisement Amid the upheaval, Panamanian President Roberto F. Chiari suspended diplomatic relations with the US; the terms of their resumption three months later included initiating a process to negotiate a new treaty, which would replace the Hay-Bunau-Varilla agreement. Former president Aristedes Royo, who helped negotiate the Torrijos-Carter treaties and served as the civilian face of Panama’s dictatorship when the agreements went into effect, told me that by trying to keep the Panamanian students from raising their flag that January day in 1964, the Zonians ultimately benefited the Panamanian cause. Royo and I spoke in late 2023, as he was completing his tenure as minister of canal affairs. We met in his wood-paneled office, which was converted from a former Canal Zone school and located only a short distance from where the flag riots broke out. As he recalls it, the 1977 treaties owe a debt of gratitude to “the Zonians’ poor conduct that day.” The road from the riots to the Torrijos-Carter treaties was hardly straight. Successive US administrations delayed, uneager to cede any control over such a strategic foothold. Only in the aftermath of Washington’s catastrophic war in Vietnam, when Carter took office seeking a foreign policy rooted in respect for international law and the self-determination of other nations, did Panama’s fortunes change. At the time of treaty implementation, some 3,500 “true” Zonians—white US civilian laborers with multigenerational histories on the isthmus—and their families resided in the enclave, a select minority among the 14,500 total US and Panamanian workers employed by the Panama Canal Company and the Canal Zone Government. To these Zonians, whose daily reality depended on Washington’s forcible presence in Panama, the 1977 agreement spelled the end of a way of life. Those that remained over the transition period would be tasked with training a Panamanian workforce to take over their jobs. When the treaties entered into force on October 1, 1979, it marked the formal dissolution of the Canal Zone as such: the Republic of Panama immediately assumed jurisdiction over much of the ten-mile-wide territory. US military bases and personnel in Panama came under a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), an accord establishing a legal framework to dictate the rights and privileges of military-affiliated foreign nationals stationed in another country. US personnel began gradually turning over townsites, military bases, and infrastructure in the former Zone, to be completed over the following decades. In accordance with the Panama Canal Act of 1979, the legislation that implemented the treaties, Canal Commission employees were allowed to retire as early as forty-eight with eighteen years of service, or at any age after twenty-three years of service, effectively ensuring that all workers employed at the time the Torrijos-Carter Treaties were signed would be able to start collecting pensions upon the completion of the transition in 1999. The possibility of early retirement was not enough to placate the Zonians. Even before the ink had dried on the Panama Canal Treaties, negotiation efforts sparked what some in the community have called “the exodus.” A world was ending, and Jimmy Carter was the horseman of their apocalypse. On September 30, 1979, they went to bed under US jurisdiction and awoke under the government of Omar Torrijos, a mestizo general from the hinterlands of Panama.5 The vast majority of the community left Panama and resettled elsewhere, predominantly in the southern climes of the US. They were under no legal obligation to depart; Torrijos had extended citizenship to the Zonians in the years leading up to the treaty, and many of them became dual citizens. Nevertheless, as H.B. Twohy, a fourth-generation Zonian, told me, many felt an expectation to “go back home to a place I’ve never lived before.” U.S. National Archives and Records Administration/Wikimedia Commons The docks of Balboa, the capital of the American-administered Panama Canal Zone, 1923 There is a general feeling among the Zonians of having been unjustly abandoned by a federal government that had for years administered every facet of their lives, from housing to employment to grocery shopping at subsidized commissaries. There is a prevailing notion, too, that the media has dealt them an unfair hand, particularly in its portrayals of the Canal Zone’s racial segregation. “When the treaty came about, everybody was pissed,” recalled Mike Andrews, a onetime cooling and refrigeration foreman who lived and worked on the Atlantic side of the Zone. Despite his opposition to the transition he decided to remain in Panama, where both his parents are buried. Andrews departed the former Zone in 1991 to run a fishing lodge in Panama’s Darién province and has since retired. We spoke in January of 2024 at a Zonian reunion at the Elks Lodge, a beloved Zonian haunt a short drive from the Administration Building just outside Panama City. The mounted antlers of countless bucks lined the walls. “There are few places that the Americans who stayed after the treaty have to go to,” he told me, other than the lodge where we were talking. Before the transition, Andrews said, he used to hunt and fish freely in the Zone’s thick jungles and abundant waters, but now he was irked by Panama’s tighter gun regulations. “We had a utopia,” he told me. “It’s sad what happened…since the treaty. Panamanians have destroyed this country.” * The Zonians did not go down without a fight. At the time of the Torrijos-Carter Treaty negotiations, they pinned their hopes on Ronald Reagan, who as a Republican primary candidate for the 1976 presidential elections gave a fervent, oft-repeated stump speech that made him a hero to US citizens in Panama: [The] Canal Zone is not a colonial possession. It is not a long-term lease. It is sovereign United States Territory every bit the same as Alaska and all the states that were carved from the Louisiana Purchase. We should end those negotiations and tell the General: We bought it, we paid for it, we built it, and we intend to keep it. That the claim was inaccurate—in fact the 1903 treaty leased the Canal Zone territory to the United States in perpetuity rather than transferring ownership—made little difference to the Zonians and their neoconservative allies in the metropole. “We thought he was going to be our salvation,” Andrews recalled of Reagan, who lost the 1976 primary to Gerald Ford but went on to oust Jimmy Carter from the White House in a landslide four years later. After Reagan won the presidency, in Andrews’s telling, he had too much “political pressure put on him” to thwart the canal transition. And yet the US hardly stayed out of Panamanian politics after 1980. The Department of Defense maintained its Southern Command headquarters in the Canal Zone neighborhood of Quarry Heights and continued training Panama’s military, the Panamanian Defense Forces, at the US Army School of the Americas, located in the former Zone’s Fort Gulick. One of the school’s graduates, Manuel Noriega, became the de facto dictator of Panama in 1983 following Omar Torrijos’s death in a suspicious plane crash two years prior. Noriega was a crucial collaborator in the Reagan administration’s War on Drugs, funneling information to the Drug Enforcement Agency and the CIA even as he forged his own narcotrafficking empire. By 1982 he was charging runners from Pablo Escobar’s Medellín drug cartel $100,000 per trip to use Panamanian airstrips to transit their wares, sending members of the PDF to coordinate the operations and payments.6 By mid-decade the US–Panamanian relationship was fraying, in part as a result of Noriega’s illegal activities, which the journalist Seymour Hersh detailed in June 1986 in a bombshell investigation for The New York Times. As Panamanians took to the streets in opposition and the dictatorship meted out increasingly violent repression, the general came to seem more like a liability than an asset. Finally, in 1989, the US Department of Defense unleashed some 26,000 troops on the isthmus to depose and capture Noriega. Steve Starr/Corbis/Getty Images American tanks in the streets of Panama City during the US invasion, 1989 Washington helped install the US-friendly president Guillermo Endara, who was sworn into office on one of the remaining US military bases in the early morning hours of December 20 at the very moment that Operation Just Cause—as the US called the invasion—descended upon the country. Eighteen thousand Panamanians lost their homes to the operation; the Pentagon reported 516 Panamanian casualties, but independent human rights groups estimated that civilian deaths were in the thousands. Many of the slain were residents of El Chorrillo, an Afro-Panamanian neighborhood in downtown Panama City that was also home to the PDF headquarters. The Department of Defense all but razed El Chorrillo to the ground in an indiscriminate bombing campaign in the first hours of the invasion; thousands of Chorrilleros had to be resettled in temporary housing, and many found themselves in active or defunct US bases along the Canal. Twenty-five-hundred people would ultimately spend two years living in improvised shelters fashioned from airplane hangars that were previously part of the Albrook Air Force Station.7 Despite the carnage, much of Panamanian society was relieved to be rid of Noriega. In the years leading up to his ouster the Cruzada Civilista (Civil Crusade), a dynamic coalition drawing from all sectors of the country’s citizenry, assembled a peaceful movement against the strongman. Some of its members would go on to have prominent government positions in post-invasion Panama, including José Raúl Mulino. The country rebuilt, democracy returned, and those exiled by the dictatorship could at last return home. In the following decades relations between Washington and Panama City have been amicable and robust. All the country’s heads of state since 2000 have received their higher education in the US, and the two countries have signed numerous security and free trade agreements since the end of the canal transition. Even as the canal’s administration became solely Panamanian, US presence remained palpable: a retired naval admiral and former commander in chief of the US Atlantic Fleet chairs the Panama Canal Authority’s advisory board. The US has also remained the canal’s primary customer: roughly 40 percent of all the country’s container shipping moves through Panama each year. The Zonians, for their part, largely adapted to life in the continental US, resigned to commemorating their history at reunions in Florida or, for the more committed, returning to Panama for annual events. Some have purchased reverted buildings in the former Canal Zone and fixed them up as vacation stays for part of the year. Many maintain their dislike for Carter and incline toward conservative politics. Mike Andrews, for one, considers Reagan the best president of his lifetime, even if he failed to recover the Canal Zone. “This is a very strong Republican populace,” he told me about his fellow reunion attendees in 2024. Most Zonians have by now come to accept the transition as an inevitable part of history. At this year’s Elks Lodge reunion, however, the enclave the Zonians came to commemorate had reemerged as a major news story. The newly appointed secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was about to land in Panama for his first official trip abroad. “Did you pick out your house yet?” some of the pro-Trump attendees half-joked, suggesting that perhaps their past was not quite past after all. * Rubio arrived on February 1. In Panama City there was a nervous mixture of dread and excitement. More progressive sectors of society were predictably incensed. The historically radical University of Panama held an emergency teach-in following Trump’s inauguration, where students and faculty posted enormous signs proclaiming that “Panama Is and Will Remain Sovereign and Neutral”—both refuting Trump’s claims that China was operating the canal and stressing that Panama has no legal obligation to kowtow to Washington. (One of the original 1977 Torrijos-Carter agreements, the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, stipulates as much.) The labor union conglomerate SUNTRACS led protests that shut down large swaths of Panama City; some members trampled signs portraying Rubio in an SS uniform and standing before a Nazi flag. Enea Lebrun/picture alliance/Getty Images A protester confronting police offers during Marco Rubio’s visit to Panama City, February 2, 2025 Not everyone was as quick to condemn the new administration. Many Panamanians were intrigued that the first Latino US secretary of state was visiting their country. On the morning of Rubio’s meeting with President Mulino, onlookers gathered near the presidential Palacio de las Garzas in the neighborhood of Casco Viejo, a small outcropping of lowlands perched on the Bay of Panama. Before the meeting Rubio attended mass in a nearby cathedral that housed an image of the Caridad del Cobre, the Virgin of Charity and Cuba’s patron saint—a nod to his Cuban heritage. The area was swarmed with press and onlookers, some of whom posed to take selfies with Rubio, who spoke to Mulino’s staff and ministers in Spanish. For Rubio, the trip was intended to christen an era of resurgent US dominion in the Americas—one in which the United States would unilaterally dictate other nations’ immigration and trade policy. Panama is of outsized importance to both issues. The southeast end of the country is flanked by the Darién Gap, a treacherous strip of jungle separating South and Central America through which more than 300,000 migrants passed last year on their way north toward the US–Mexico border. Then, of course, there is the country’s relationship with Beijing. China is the Canal’s second-largest customer and has significantly increased direct investment in Panama over the last decade. At a press conference after his meeting with Rubio that February morning, Mulino announced the first of what would in the coming months grow into a cavalcade of concessions to the Trump administration. He assured his constituents that no US military invasion was imminent—an understandable preoccupation for a citizenry that watched Black Hawk helicopters swarm their neighborhoods decades ago—but announced that he would modify Panama’s anti-immigration efforts to accord with the Trump administration’s demands. SENAFRONT, Panama’s corollary to the US Border Patrol, has collaborated with the US government for years on anti-immigration initiatives, receiving direct training from the US Army; there is even an ICE office in the US embassy in Panama City. But Rubio’s visit made plain that Washington expected still more draconian measures. Among other things, Mulino announced that he had offered the US the use of an airstrip to facilitate deportation flights for migrants attempting to pass through the Darién Gap. Before Rubio left the country in the following days, he personally oversaw a deportation flight leaving from the former US airport at Albrook, outside Panama City. Mulino also announced that Panama would withdraw from the Belt and Road initiative, Beijing’s sweeping global infrastructure program encompassing 150 countries around the world, including more than twenty in Latin America. Panama became the first country in the region to sign on to the initiative in 2017, the year it established formal diplomatic relations with Beijing. That rapprochement occurred during the first Trump presidency, during which the state department failed to appoint a US ambassador to the country, leaving, as Mulino put it, “many empty seats” into which China easily slid. And yet China’s presence in Panama is nowhere near as extensive as Trump has claimed. Panama’s relationship to the US remains far more longstanding and robust, and the Mulino administration has made clear which side it’s taking in the emergent new cold war. In a particularly telling move, the week before Trump’s inauguration, Mulino’s government announced that it would audit the Panama Ports Company, a subsidiary of the Hong Kong multinational CK Hutchinson Holdings, owned by the billionaire Li Ka-Shing. In 1997, when the canal’s incoming Panamanian administration offered foreign governments and multinationals leases on concessions to some of the ports along the passage, Ka-Shing vastly outbid his American competitor for control of the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal, offering Panama $22 million in annual rent and 10 percent of its port revenue for a duration of twenty-five years. Panama renewed those contracts as recently as 2021, but the announcement suggested that Mulino’s administration might be hoping to find inconsistencies in Panama Ports’ bookkeeping that could give Panama legal cause to sever the agreements—a development that would permit it to cut one of its principal ties with China at its own discretion. As the audit dragged on, the US sought its own workaround: On March 4 the US asset management firm BlackRock announced an agreement with CK Hutchinson Holdings to purchase 90 percent of the Panama Ports Company. Trump lauded the deal as a foreign policy victory. The Chinese government, for its part, was quick to denounce the agreement as a “hegemonic act” that thwarted “the legitimate rights and interests of other countries through coercion, pressure, inducement, and other despicable means.” Beijing has a series of legal mechanisms it may draw on to probe the deal, including the use of a sweeping National Security law passed in 2020 in response to protests that had erupted in Hong Kong the year prior. Panama, meanwhile, struggling to assert some self-determination, announced that its audit had turned up evidence of misconduct that may lead it to deem the 2021 contract illegal and void. In the event that Panama manages to annul its concessions agreements with CK Hutchinson Holdings, the Panama Ports Company could be ousted from the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal regardless of who owns it, potentially allowing for bids from foreign governments and multinationals on Panama’s terms. The strategy, if it works, will allow Panama to maintain a semblance of autonomy even as it placates Washington by extricating China from its ports. Mulino’s attempted balancing act has yielded dubious results. His pivot away from Beijing and his deference to the US on immigration policy have not stopped Washington from pursuing physical encroachments on the isthmus. Shortly after the BlackRock deal was announced in March, Trump ordered the Pentagon to draw up plans for military actions in Panama—a perplexing move, since Panama demilitarized after the US invasion and has no standing army. And in April Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, fresh off accidentally leaking information about military strikes in Yemen to the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic via Signal, returned to the isthmus to exact still more concessions. During his visit the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding permitting the US to deploy troops to some of Washington’s former military installations along the waterway, which Panama transformed into commercial logistics hubs after the transition. The deployments are rotational, with US troops moving through sites that will remain under Panama’s full administrative authority. The memorandum stopped short of allowing the US to establish its own bases in the country or to retake control of the installations it had vacated by 1999. All the same, it dealt a remarkable blow to Panamanian sovereignty. * As Marco Rubio terminated his February trip to Panama, I met again with Aristedes Royo, this time in a cafe in the business district of Obarrio in downtown Panama City. Royo had concluded his term as minister of canal affairs roughly a year earlier, and that day he was holding court for a cortege of reporters from around the world who had come to the isthmus to cover Rubio’s visit. When Royo and I first spoke in 2023, he concluded the interview with an emphatic affirmation of the good will between Panama and the US—a happy ending to a personal and national saga, one he assumed would not be undone. At our recent meeting, however, he sang a different tune. “It may be dangerous to be America’s enemy,” he said with a slow shake of his head, quoting a line attributed to Henry Kissinger, “but to be America’s friend is fatal.” Mark Schiefelbein/POOL/AFP US Secretary of State Marco Rubio walking with Ricaurte Vasquez, the administrator of the Panama Canal Authority, during a tour of the canal’s Miraflores locks, Panama City, February 2, 2025 Royo spent much of our second conversation explaining in painstaking detail how the Panama Canal functioned—the role of the Panamanian citizens who pilot small vessels to guide container ships through the locks system and the structure of the Panama Canal Authority, which employs more than eight thousand Panamanians to administer and run the waterway. The operation was Panamanian through and through, he emphasized: Panama would be able to limit the access of vessels from any nation if they posed a threat to the canal’s security and neutrality. It felt as though he were attempting to speak to the Trump administration through me, that if he could convince me that China was not running the canal, then the US government would understand it, too. In the following months Panama’s security minister, Frank Ábrego, and its canal administrator, Ricaurte Vásquez Morales, offered similar assurances to visiting US officials. And yet none of them have seemed to stop the Trump administration from reiterating its claims about Chinese incursion. Some in the Zonian community have echoed the allegation. “You can go throughout Panama and see big road signs all in that squiggly Chinese writing,” Mike Andrews told me. In Zonian groups on social media, Trump’s language and policies have inspired debate. Some members celebrated the prospect of renewed US control over the waterway, while others seemed resigned to the idea that there would be no return to the Zone they once called home. (“As a czbrat I loved the cz. But get over it,” one posted in a Facebook group after Trump’s inauguration.) If there was a consistency across the community, however, it was the prevailing sense of historical grievance. “It has hurt many a Zonian that Panama has not erected any monument or memorabilia thanking the USA for the Canal,” Andrews said over e-mail. Panamanians, meanwhile, took to the streets in response to April’s memorandum of understanding, claiming that the president had signed away the country’s autonomy. Mulino has since informed his constituents that he will not renegotiate the security deal. “Panama’s sovereignty is not at stake, it’s not handed over, it’s not given,” he said in his weekly national press conference on May 8. And yet now that US troops are positioned to deploy to three of Washington’s former military bases on the isthmus—Fort Sherman, Rodman Naval Station, and Howard Air Force Base—the country’s military will have a presence on Panamanian soil without parallel since the last century. The installations are nestled in las áreas revertidas (“the reverted areas”), a large stretch of which Panama decades ago transformed into a bucolic nature reserve and rechristened Sovereignty National Park.

Title: Spot XRP ETF Path Made Clear After Ripple CEO Confirms Ending SEC Case ‘Once And For All’

The nearly five-year legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to be finally coming to an end after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced Friday that the company plans to drop its cross-appeal in the prolonged case. “Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they’ve previously said,” Garlinghouse wrote in a post on X. “We’re closing this chapter once and for all, and focusing on what’s most important— building the Internet of Value. Lock in.” Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they’ve previously said. We’re closing this chapter once and for all, and focusing on what’s most important – building the Internet of Value. Lock in. https://t.co/ZsRgDfcpLh The announcement comes just a day after U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres denied a joint bid from Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission to slash a $125 million penalty and toss out a permanent injunction imposed against the blockchain payments company last year. That decision followed less than two weeks after the SEC and Ripple asked that the court reduce the civil penalty over illegal XRP sales to $50 million, significantly less than the $2 billion sought under former Chair Gary Gensler. The legal drama between Ripple and the SEC has been going on for years since December 2020, when the regulator accused the XRP-linked firm of raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering. In 2023, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP on crypto exchanges did not break securities laws. Torres did, however, rule that other direct sales of the token to institutional investors qualified as securities. Ripple was fined $125 million and banned from similar sales. Both Ripple and the SEC agreed to allow $50 million of the initially-imposed $125 million fine to go to the SEC, with the remaining $75 million to be returned to the San Francisco-based company, though they have encountered pushback in court over the past month. XRP was changing hands around $2.19 on Saturday, reflecting a 5% increase over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The token is up a whopping 358% over the past year. According to Nate Geraci, the President of ETF Store, the conclusion of the case effectively removes the regulatory hurdle blocking the approval of U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Over nine asset managers have so far filed for XRP ETF products in the US, including major issuers like Bitwise, ProShares, 21Shares, and Franklin Templeton. Despite the growing XRP ETF filing frenzy, BlackRock — issuer of the largest spot Bitcoin ETF — has yet to submit paperwork for an XRP-based investment vehicle. Geraci believes that with no regulatory obstacles in sight, BlackRock could soon apply with the SEC to introduce an ETF tied to the industry’s fourth-largest crypto by market cap.

Title: Meta’s Xbox-Branded Quest 3S Just Sold Out for All the Wrong Reasons

Everyone loves limited-edition stuff. There’s Sony’s 30th anniversary PS5, or Analogue’s many limited edition Pocket handhelds, orâ I don’t knowâthe Shamrock f***ing Shake. But there’s one type of person who loves limited-edition stuff more than your average consumer, and it’s a scalper. For proof of that, see Meta’s recently released Xbox-branded Quest 3S. See Meta Quest Xbox Edition at Best Buy In case you missed it, Meta’s new limited-edition Quest 3S bundle just recently sold out, which on the surface sounds like a great thing for VR and XR. You may be tempted to say, “Oh, wow! People really like XR headsets, huh?” But before you do that, it may also be worth taking a short gander at eBay, because the resale market over there paints a slightly more cynical picture. It’s fullÂ of Xbox-branded Quest 3S bundles, folksâand they ain’t just giving them away. This bundle, for reference, retails at $399, and the average price I’m seeing on eBay is about $600, though sometimes a little more or a little less. Here is the sad state of affairs on eBay as of the time of typing these words: The list goes on and on, unfortunately, which tells me one thing: the scalpers had a field day with this thing. And that’s just kind of sad. It’s not sad that someone would want to make money from reselling a limited-edition gadgetâas annoying as scalpers are, I can’t blame anyone for having a side hustle in this economy. But it is sad that Meta seemingly didn’t do much to preserve its limited-edition Quest 3S for XR nerds who unequivocally deserve first dibs. It’s also maybe a little sadâas someone who borders on said XR nerd identityâthat the race to being out of stock may not actually be driven by real demand. XR headsets, while not the most crucial gadget in the world, are pretty cool and deserve more shine than they get, in my humble opinion. It would have been nice to see them really break through with a little help from an Xbox marketing gimmick. But as always, the almighty aftermarket prevails. To be fair, I’m sure not all of the sales were scalpers trying to make a buck off the XR headset’s rarity. Some people, I presume, bought it because it’s a pretty good deal for getting into XRâyou get a sleek black headset with Xbox green details, Meta’s Elite Strap for your head, and a limited-edition Xbox controller to top it off. Based on the retail price of all of that, this bundle saves you somewhere in the ballpark of $95. Some people bought this bundle because of Xbox, too. Here’s one instance in which someone seems to have pulled the trigger on this bundle just for the controller. Honestly… respect. That’s much more pure than trying to spin the whole thing around for $200. The idea that someone buys the new Quest colorway just to nab the limited edition Xbox Controller and sell the rest is really comical.. pic.twitter.com/b5ER1xIfqe — SadlyItsDadley (@SadlyItsBradley) June 27, 2025 Listen, scalpers are an inevitable fact of life nowadays when you’re buying any gadget that’s even slightly in demand. Like it or not, that’s just the world we live inâone colored by bots and dropshipping. But I’d be lying if I said that it wouldn’t have been nice to see a little effort on Meta’s part to prevent that. It can be done! Just look at the Switch 2 launch. People have been resorting to cartoonish levels of robbery to get their hands on itâthat’s how in-demand this thing isâbut Nintendo, with a little bit of forethought, has kept the scourge of scalpers to a dull roar. I guess Meta probably doesn’t care that much either way, though. A sale is a sale, whether it ends up on eBay or on your dorky XR- and Xbox-loving head. Sadly, if you’re in the latter camp, it looks like the aftermarket is your only option right now. Thanks, Zuckerberg. Just because you look like a dropshipper doesn’t mean you have to act like one.

"I think Xbox hardware is dead," said Laura Fryer, a founding member of Xbox, in a video slamming Microsoft's fumbling of the game system. A Switch 2 is cheaper, but a handheld like the Legion Go S with SteamOS offers ease of use and PC-like versatility.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, June 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Title: Billions in corporate buys can’t budge Bitcoin—5 reasons the BTC price won’t move

Why is Bitcoin’s price flat even as companies buy billions? Hidden dynamics behind ETF flows, paper bitcoin, and market manipulation, for a start. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. From Michael Saylor to David Bailey, Anthony Pompliano to Jack Mallers, and everyone in between, there’s a rising tide of executives buying bitcoin for their corporate treasuries. Large companies and Wall Street are vacuuming up billions of dollars’ worth of BTC every week, yet its price remains relatively untouched. One Bitcoiner took to Twitter to ask why and received more than 1.3K replies. Here’s the best: “Can anyone explain to me why companies are buying billions of dollars of bitcoin every week and the price is virtually unchanged over the last 6 months?” Bitcoin Cam’s question clearly reflects the broader sentiment of Crypto Twitter, receiving over 800,000 views in a few hours and more than 1,300 replies. Even Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff chimed in with his 2 cents: “The whales who already own a bunch of Bitcoin are selling to these buyers to cash out their huge gains.” But the best reply came from SightBringer, who provides signal-bearing intelligence across macro, crypto, and capital. He said: “They’re buying billions and the price isn’t moving because this isn’t a market anymore – it’s a controlled ignition chamber.” Then he broke it down point by point: Basically, large investors like BlackRock and Fidelity are buying real bitcoin through special funds called ETFs. This isn’t just pretend money; these are actual coins being tucked away for the long term. In 2025, public companies bought a record number of bitcoins, and these ETFs are seeing billions in new money come in. The coins are being taken off exchanges, so fewer are left for everyone else to buy or sell. Here, SightBringer explains that most trading on big crypto exchanges doesn’t actually move real coins. Instead, it’s just “paper bitcoin” (IOUs or promises to deliver bitcoin later). This means there’s a lot of trading, but not much real bitcoin changing hands. If everyone tried to take their coins out at once, things could get messy (think Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in 2023). This makes the market seem bigger than it really is. Echoing Schiff’s reply, in point 3, SightBringer means that large holders, known as whales, aren’t selling their old coins on the open market. Instead, they’re selling quietly to new buyers or moving coins to private wallets. This keeps the price from jumping around. In April alone, Glassnode revealed that whales had absorbed more than 300% of the newly mined bitcoin supply, drastically reducing the coins available to everyone else. Big companies and funds don’t like wild price swings. They need stable prices to make sure everything works smoothly. BlackRock and others are even saying bitcoin is less volatile than before, which is good for them, as the asset becomes more credible to investors. SightBringer maintains that the market is being manipulated, with the BTC price being held back on purpose. When it finally breaks out, it could go exponentially higher, and it might not come back down. That’s why the big players are getting ready now, so they’re in the best position when the real move happens. “The real question isn’t “why isn’t it moving?” It’s: Who’s making sure it doesn’t and why?” At the time of press 1:30 pm UTC on Jun. 28, 2025, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is up 0.11% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $2.13 trillion with a 24-hour trading volume of $38.52 billion.

The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025.

LAST UPDATE | 28 Jun FORMER FIÁNNA FÁIL minister Mary Hanafin has said that she’s “in the mix” for the party’s presidential nomination. “If I could contest it, I would happily do that. It’s a role I would hope people could feel I would do well, both nationally and internationally,” she told The Irish Independent. Sixty-six-year-old Hanafin previously told The Irish Times in April that she was open to the conversation of contesting the presidency – although she said it was ultimately up to Taoiseach and party leader Micheál Martin. She is the first Fianna Fáil party member to announce her intention to contest the nomination. This afternoon, Cynthia Ní Mhurchú was asked on RTÉ’s Saturday with Colm Ó Mongain if she had ruled out a bid for the Fianna Fáil presidential nomination, who replied that she was “extremely happy” in her current role as an MEP. Ní Mhurchú did not wholly rule out the prospect. Fine Gael’s MEP Seán Kelly has all but declared his intention to run, having told The Journal in Brussels earlier this week that the main deterrent is the length of a presidential term. Hanafin was first elected to the Dáil in 1997, serving the Dún Laoghaire constituency. Throughout her three consecutive terms as a TD, she held a number of Cabinet positions, including Minister for Education, Minister for Enterprise, and Minister for Social and Family Affairs, and Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport. Advertisement Hanafin pictured in 2011. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo In 2011, she was briefly deputy leader of Fianna Fáil, having lost the party’s leadership election to incumbent leader Micheál Martin. Hanafin left office in 2011. In 2014, she served as a councillor on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county council, representing Blackrock. She remained on the council until 2024. In 2014, Hanafin defied the wishes of Martin for her to refrain from submitting nomination papers to contest the local elections in the Blackrock area. Dubbed the ‘Battle of Blackrock’, Hanafin was ultimately elected on the first count. She drew criticism from former Taoiseach Brian Cowen’s wife Mary Cowen in 2016, when Hanafin was apparently rebuffed by Martin after she announced she intended to join Fianna Fáil’s front bench were she elected to the Dáil. Hanafin subsequently made remarks regarding Martin at the party’s ardfheis – which Mary Cowen derided in a Facebook post. Hanafin is the daughter of Des Hanafin, a businessman and Fianna Fáil councillor who also served as a senator. Her brother John Hanafin was a member of the Seanad from 2002 to 2008. She is currently a barrister. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

June 28, 2025 07:46 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: ‘Huge’ BlackRock Crypto Bombshell Suddenly Hurtling Toward Bitcoin At Key Price ‘Turning Point’

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has bounced back in recent weeks, surging as serious U.S. dollar collapse fears drive billionaire interest in bitcoin. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has soared toward its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, with traders betting a looming Federal Reserve flip will turbo-charge the crypto market. Now, as U.S. president Donald Trump issues a surprise crypto prediction, bitcoin and crypto are braced for a “huge” BlackRock crypto market bombshell that has suddenly appeared on the “horizon.” Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run In-kind redemptions for the bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have taken Wall Street by storm over the last 18 months could be coming soon, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Hester Peirce. “I can’t prejudge, but we hear that there’s a lot of interest,” Peirce, who heads up the SEC’s crypto task force, said on stage at a Bitcoin Policy Institute event, adding that in kind bitcoin and crypto ETFs are now “on the horizon.” In-kind redemptions allow investors to exchange ETF shares directly for the underlying asset rather than receiving cash, which is currently the case for the spot bitcoin and crypto ETFs approved by the SEC in early 2024—a change described as “huge” by Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. In-kind redemptions for bitcoin and crypto funds would make it cheaper and quicker for traders to buy and sell ETF shares, potentially making them more attractive to institutional investors on Wall Street. Earlier this year, BlackRock, which has dominated the spot bitcoin ETF market with its $75 billion IBIT fund, asked the SEC to permit in-kind creations and redemptions for bitcoin ETFs, instead of having to use cash, with the likes of Fidelity and other smaller bitcoin and crypto ETF providers following suit. "Those (forms) are going through the process now," Peirce said. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious BlackRock, which manages after around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024 that now hold 1.4 million bitcoin worth $152 billion. BlackRock’s fund alone holds around 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth almost $75 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network. Meanwhile, the combined bitcoin price and crypto market is on the verge of a “turning point” as it hits $3.4 trillion, according to one analyst. “The $3.4 trillion to 3.55 trillion range is a turning point, which has activated sellers and prevented the market from consolidating higher,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro chief market analyst, said in emailed comments. “Since the end of Wednesday, bitcoin has been testing the $108,000 mark, but it will sell off when it touches this level. Over the past couple of days, we have seen a smooth but steady intraday uptrend, accompanied by heavy buying from medium—and long-term investors. We see this as a sign of buying by professional market participants and link it to strengthening stocks, which increases the likelihood of reaching $110,000 or even $112,000 as early as this week.”

Title: Our 8% Dividend Playbook For The $36-Trillion Debt Panic

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. The words "Government Debt" with hundred dollar bills in the background. “Those are some crazy numbers.” An old friend had messaged me, and that line caught my attention. As it turned out, he had 36 trillion numbers in mind: the national debt, in other words. That is a pretty striking figure, and it’s fair to ask how the country’s debt could go from a trillion dollars back in 1981 to 36 times that today. “Very irresponsible, imo,” my friend wrote. This sounds like a reasonable response, and many people think this way. But the problem here, from an investment perspective, is that most people look at the debt on its own, without considering the many other factors we’re going to delve into today. My quick take: The rising US government debt load is not a good reason to avoid stocks, or, in our case, the 8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold our favorite stocks. I’m talking about funds holding strong blue chips that form the backbone of the country’s economy, like Visa (V), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and NVIDIA (NVDA). Now it is absolutely true that too much debt is unsustainable, and the US government isn’t accountable for this debt—we taxpayers are. But there’s more to the story than this. In 2017, total government debt hit $20 trillion. That, by the way, was the last time I wrote in-depth on this topic. I still feel the same way I did then: that the US government is actually financially healthier than the average American. That’s because then, as now, people tended to look at the debt in isolation (a common mistake!). But the US government has plenty of tools it can use—and trends working in its favor—that make it easier to manage its debt than many people think. Let’s start with a key number: the amount of revenue the government collects in a year through taxes and other fees. Today, as in 2017, about 18% of US GDP goes to the federal government. That’s $5.2 trillion, at the current size of the US economy. Looked at another way, if Uncle Sam were to divert all of that revenue to paying off the debt (which is impossible, obviously, but stick with me for a second), he’d do so in about six-and-a-half years. Here’s the key point, though: That six-and-a-half years is only slightly higher than the six years it would’ve taken in 2017. And let’s not forget that we had a pandemic in there, which caused a big spike in public debt. So, viewed that way, government debt has remained about as manageable as it was eight years ago, and it would likely be more manageable if COVID hadn’t come along. Now let’s go one step further and stack up debt and GDP growth: Debt/GDP Chart Both federal debt and GDP were growing at almost the same rate before the pandemic, which, as we just discussed, caused a bump in debt. And, of course, GDP took a hit then, too, with the economy in lockdown. As a result, GDP has grown about 55% in the last eight years or so, while total debt has grown about 80%. Obviously, this means America’s debt-to-income ratio is worse than it was before the pandemic. But that’s not because of a structural issue. We can point at the pandemic as the main cause here, in this case. Still, a one-time hit could be trouble in the long run, right? Sure, but look at this chart. Debt/GDP 2017 The extra government debt due to the COVID-19 crisis looks bad because the numbers are huge, but if we compare it to the bump, and continued accelerated rise, in indebtedness sparked by the 2008/2009 financial crisis, the 2020 debt increase is rather small, as you can see below. Debt Crisis Before 2008, the ratio of US public debt to GDP was around 35%, and in less than five years, it doubled to 70%, where it remained until the pandemic, after which it went above 100% before falling to 96%, where it is now. On a relative basis, the jump in 2008 was clearly worse than in 2020. Yet America survived just fine. So there’s no reason to worry, unless and until this chart changes direction. Labor Productivity Above is the real story: labor productivity. It’s risen by a third since 2007, meaning Americans now produce about $1.33 in value for every dollar they produced back in 2007. And note how that’s been a pretty stable line upwards? America keeps producing more effectively and efficiently: This is progress, growth and prosperity. And now we have AI, which is likely to give productivity another boost. This also explains why the S&P 500 has delivered 10.4% annualized returns over the last two decades, in line with the 10.3% annualized returns it’s delivered over the last century. And, yes, during that time, the federal debt grew, as did the US government’s income, thanks to higher US productivity producing higher GDP. So if you’re thinking of cutting back on your US holdings due to the debt, remember these three things: Instead, now is the time to boost our holdings in the US, and doing so through CEFs yielding 8%+ is hands-down the best way to do it. With CEFs, we get exposure to strong blue chips like the ones I mentioned earlier, often at a discount, since these funds’ market prices can—and often do—trade for less than the value of their portfolios. That’s our “discount to NAV” in CEF-speak. Big dividends and big discounts from S&P 500 stocks. Try getting that from an index fund or by buying these stocks “direct.” It’s just not possible. And any fear—and hence bigger discounts—caused by overwrought debt worries just makes our opportunity even sweeter. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 28 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 28 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry.

Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 28 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more.

Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: How AI is killing jobs in the tech industry

Time Published: 2025-06-28T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
“What will AI mean for jobs?” may be the single most-asked question about the technology category that dominates Silicon Valley, pop culture, and our politics. Fears that AI will put us out of work routinely top opinion polls. Bosses are citing AI as the reason they’re slashing human staff. Firms like Duolingo and Klarna have laid off workers in loudly touted shifts to AI, and DOGE used its “AI-first” strategy to justify firing federal workers. Meanwhile, tech executives are pouring fuel on the flames. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, claims that AI products like his will soon eliminate half of entry level white collar jobs, and replace up to 20% of all jobs, period. OpenAI’s Sam Altman says that AI systems can replace entry level workers, and will soon be able to code “like an experienced software engineer.” Elsewhere, he’s been blunter, claiming "Jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop." But the question remains: What’s actually happening on the ground, right now? There’s no doubt that lots of firms are investing heavily in AI and trying to use it to improve productivity and cut labor costs. And it’s clear that in certain industries, especially creative ones, the rise of cheap AI-generated content is hitting workers hard. Yet broader economic data on AI impacts suggests a more limited disruption. Two and a half years after the rise of ChatGPT, after a torrent of promises, CEO talk, and think pieces, how is—or isn’t—AI really reshaping work? About a month ago, I put out a call in hopes of finding some answers. I had a vague idea for a project I’d call AI Killed My Job, that would seek to examine the many ways that management has used AI to impact, transform, degrade, or, yes, try to replace workers outright. It’s premised on the notion that we’ve heard lots of speculation and plenty of sales pitches for AI automation—but we have not heard nearly enough from the workers experiencing the phenomenon themselves. The title is somewhat tongue-in-cheek; we recognize that AI is not sentient, that it’s management, not AI, that fires people, but also that there are many ways that AI can “kill” a job, by sapping the pleasure one derives from work, draining it of skill and expertise, or otherwise subjecting it to degradation. So, I wrote a post here on the newsletter explaining the idea, posted a call to social media, and asked for testimonials on various news shows and podcasts. I was floored by the response. The stories came rolling in. I heard from lots of folks I expected to—artists, illustrators, copywriters, translators—and many I didn’t—senior engineers, managers of marketing departments, construction industry consultants. And just about everyone in between. I got so many responses, and so many good ones, that I resolved to structure the project as a series of pieces that center the workers’ voices and testimonies themselves, and share their experiences in their own words. Because I got so many accounts, I decided to break down the articles by field and background. Starting, today, with an industry that’s at once the source of the automating technology and feeling some of its most immediate impacts. Today, we’ll begin by looking at how AI is killing jobs in the tech industry. I heard from workers who recounted how managers used AI to justify laying them off, to speed up their work, and to make them take over the workload of recently terminated peers. I heard from workers at the biggest tech giants and the smallest startups—from workers at Google, TikTok, Adobe, Dropbox, and CrowdStrike, to those at startups with just a handful of employees. I heard stories of scheming corporate climbers using AI to consolidate power inside the organization. I heard tales of AI being openly scorned in company forums by revolting workers. And yes, I heard lots of sad stories of workers getting let go so management could make room for AI. I received a message from one worker who wrote to say they were concerned for their job—and a follow-up note just weeks later to say that they’d lost it. Of the scores of responses I received, I’ve selected 15 that represent these trends; some are short and offer a snapshot of various AI impacts or a quick look at the future of employment. Others are longer accounts with many insights into what it means to work in tech in the time of AI—and what it might mean to work, period. The humor, grace, and candor in many of these testimonials often amazed me. I cannot thank those who wrote them enough. Some of these workers took great risks to share their stories at a time when it is, in tech, a legitimate a threat to one’s job to speak up about AI. For this reason, I’ve agreed to keep these testimonies anonymous, to protect the identities of the workers who shared them. Generative AI is the most hyped, most well-capitalized technology of our generation, and its key promise, that it will automate jobs, desperately needs to be examined. This is the start of that examination. Three very quick notes before we move on. First, this newsletter, and projects like AI Killed My Job, require a lot of work to produce. If you find this valuable, please consider becoming a paid subscriber. With enough support, I can expand such projects with human editors, researchers, and even artists—like Koren Shadmi, who I was able to pay a small fee for the 100% human-generated art above, thanks to subscribers like you. Second, if your job has been impacted by AI, and you would like to share your story as part of this project, please do so at AIkilledmyjob@pm.me. I would love to hear your account and will keep your account confidential as I would any source. Third, some news: I'm partnering with the good folks at More Perfect Union to produce a video edition of AI Killed My Job. If you're interested in participating, or are willing to sit for an on camera interview to discuss how AI has impacted your livelihood, please reach out. Thanks for reading, human, and an extra thanks to all those whose support makes this work possible. Tech is just the first industry I plan on covering; I have countless more stories in fields from law to media to customer service to art to share. Stay tuned, and onwards. This post was edited by Mike Pearl. Content moderator at TikTok. I have a story. I worked for TikTok as a content moderator from August 2022 to April 2024, and though I was not replaced by AI, I couldn't help noticing that some of the trainers were. In my first year, I would be assigned training videos that featured real people either reading or acting. These trainings would be viewed internally only, not available to the public. Topics could be things like learning about biases, avoiding workplace harassment, policy refreshers, and so on. In the early months of my time there, the trainings were usually recorded slideshows with humans reading and elaborating on the topics. Sometimes they were videos that included people acting out scenarios. Over time, the human trainers were replaced with AI by way of generated voices or even people going over the materials in the videos. It was honestly scary to me. I don't know how to explain it. I remember that they had added embellishments to make them seem more human. I distinctly remember a woman with an obscure black tattoo on her bicep. The speech and movement wasn't as clean as what I see in videos now, but it was close enough to leave me with an eerie sensation. As far as content moderation goes, much of that is already done by AI across all major social media platforms. There has historically been a need for human moderators to differentiate grey areas that technology doesn't understand. (Example: someone being very aggressive in a video and using profanity, but it not being directed at an individual. AI might think the video involves bullying another user and ban the video, but a moderator can review it and see that there's no problem/no targeted individual.) It was honestly scary to me. I don't know how to explain it. I remember that they had added embellishments to make them seem more human. I think as AI models continue to learn, however, moderators will be replaced completely. That's just a theory, but I'm already seeing the number of these job postings dwindling and hearing murmurs from former coworkers on LinkedIn about widespread layoffs. Software engineer at Google. I have been a software engineer at Google for several years. With the recent introduction of generative AI-based coding assistance tools, we are already seeing a decline in open source code quality 1 (defined as "code churn" - how often a piece of code is written only to be deleted or fixed within a short time). I am also starting to see a downward trend of (a) new engineers' readiness in doing the work, (b) engineers' willingness to learn new things, and (c) engineers' effort to put in serious thoughts in their work. Specifically, I have recently observed first hand some of my colleagues at the start of their career heavily relying on AI-based coding assistance tools. Their "code writing" consists of iteratively and alternatingly hitting the Tab key (to accept AI-generated code) and watching for warning underlines 2 indicating there could be an error (which have been typically based on static analysis, but recently increasingly including AI-generated warnings). These young engineers - squandering their opportunities to learn how things actually work - would briefly glance at the AI-generated code and/or explanation messages and continue producing more code when "it looks okay." I also saw experienced engineers in senior positions when faced with an important data modeling task decided to generate the database schema with generative AI. I originally thought it was merely a joke but recently found out that they basically just used the generated schema in actual (internal) services essentially without modification, even if there are some obvious glaring issues. Now those issues have propagated to other code that needs to interact with that database and it will be more costly to fix, so chances are people will just carry on, pretending everything is working as intended. All of these will result in poorer software quality. "Anyone can write code" sounds good on paper, but when bad code is massively produced, it hurts everyone including those who did not ask for it and have been trusting the software industry. Former staff engineer at Dropbox. I was part of the 20% RIF at Dropbox at the end of October.3 The stated reason for this was to focus on Dash, their AI big-bet. The 10% RIF in 2023 was also to focus more on Dash. How did this eliminate my job? Internal reprioritization, that's how. I was moving into an area that was scheduled to focus on improving Dropbox's reliability stance in 2025 and beyond, intended to be a whole year initiative. It's tricky to go into details, but the aim was to take a holistic view of disaster preparedness beyond the long standing disaster scenarios we had been using and were already well prepared for. Projects like this are common in well established product-lines like Dropbox's file-sync offering, as they take a comprehensive overview of both audit compliance (common criteria change every year) and market expectations. This initiative was canned as part of the RIF, and the staffing allocated to it largely let go. Such a move is consistent with prioritizing Dash, a brand new product that does not have dominant market-share. Startups rarely prioritize availability to the extent Dropbox's file-sync product does because the big business problem faced by a startup is obtaining market-share, not staying available for your customers. As products (and companies) mature, stability starts gaining priority as part of customer retention engineering. Once a product becomes dominant in the sector, stability engineering often is prioritized over feature development. Dropbox file-sync has been at this point for several years. With Dash being a new product, and company messaging being that Dash is the future of Dropbox, a reliability initiative of the type I was gearing up for was not in line with being a new product scrapping for market-share. Thus, this project and the people assigned to it were let go. Blood in the Machine: What are you planning next? This job market is absolutely punishing. I had a .gov job for the .com crash, a publicly funded .edu job for the 2008 crash, and a safe place inside a Dropbox division making money hand over fist during the COVID crash (Dropbox Sign more than doubled document throughput over 2020). This is my first tech winter on the bench, and I'm getting zero traction. 37 job apps in the months I've been looking, 4 got me talking to a human (2 of which were referrals), all bounced me after either the recruiter or technical screens. Never made it to a virtual onsite. This has to do with me being at the Staff Engineer level, and getting there through non-traditional means. The impact is when I go through the traditional screens for a high level engineer I flame out, because that wasn't my job. The little feedback I've gotten from my hunt is a mix of 'over-qualified for this position' and 'failed the technical screen.' Attempting to branch out to other positions like Product Manager, or Technical Writer have failed due to lack of resume support and everyone hiring Senior titles. I may be retired now. I'm 50, but my money guy says I've already made retirement-money; any work I do now is to increase lifestyle, build contingency funds, or fund charitable initiatives. The industry is absolutely toxic right now as cost-cutting is dominating everything but the most recently funded startups. We haven't hit an actual recession in stock-prices due to aggressive cost and stock-price engineering everywhere, and cost-engineering typically tanks internal worker satisfaction. I've been on the bench for six months, money isn't a problem. Do I want to stick my head back into the cortisol amplifier? Not really. Tech worker, marketing department. I used to work at a mid-sized Silicon Valley startup that does hardware. The overall project is super demanding, and reliant on skilled, hands-on work. Our marketing team was tiny but committed. My manager, the CMO4, was one of the rare ones: deeply experienced and seasoned in the big ones, thoughtful, and someone who genuinely loved his craft. Last year, a new hire came in to lead another department. Genuinely believe she is a product of the "LinkedIn hustler / thought-leadership / bullshit titles" culture. Super performative. Recently and during a cross-functional meeting with a lot of people present, she casually referred to a ChatGPT model she was fine-tuning as our "Chief Marketing Officer"—in front of my manager. She claimed it was outperforming us. It wasn’t—it was producing garbage. But the real harm was watching someone who’d given decades to his field get humiliated, not by a machine, but by a colleague weaponizing it. Today, in the name of “AI efficiency,” a lot of people saw the exit door and my CMO got PIPd.5 The irony here is two-fold: one, it does not seem that the people who left were victims of a turn to "vibe coding" and I suspect that the "AI efficiency" was used as an excuse to make us seem innovative even during this crisis. Two, this is a company whose product desperately needs real human care.

AI killed my previous job, and it's killing my current one. I used to work at Adobe... Despite constantly telling my team and manager I strongly disliked GenAI and didn't want to be involved in GenAI projects, when AI hype really started picking up, my team was disbanded and I was separated from my teammates to be put on a team specifically working on GenAI. I quit, because I didn't see any way for me to organize, obstruct, or resist without being part of building something that went against my values. I often wonder whether I should have let myself get fired instead. This was before we learned that Adobe trained Firefly on Stock contributions without contributors' opt-in, and before the Terms of Service debacle, so I'm glad I wasn't there for that at least. Now I work in the public sector. It's better in most ways, but I have to spend ridiculous amounts of time explaining to colleagues and bosses why no, we can't just "use AI" to complete the task at hand. It feels like every week there's a new sales pitch from a company claiming that their AI tool will solve all our problems—companies are desperate to claw back their AI investment, and they're hoping to find easy marks in the public sector. I don't want to be a curmudgeon! I like tech and I just want to do tech stuff without constantly having to call bullshit on AI nonsense. I'd rather be doing my actual job, and organizing with my colleagues. It's exhausting to deal with credulous magical thinking from decision-makers who should know better. *My work at Adobe* When I was at Adobe, I worked in Document Cloud. So like Acrobat, not Photoshop. For most of my time there, my job was evaluating machine learning models to see if they were good enough to put in a product. The vast majority of the time, Document Cloud leadership killed machine learning projects before they ended up in a product. That was either because the quality wasn't good enough, or because of a lack of "go-to-market.” In other words, middle and upper management generally did not accept that machine learning is only appropriate for solving a small subset of problems, which need to be rigorously-scoped and well-defined. They were looking for "everything machines" (these are derogatory air quotes, not a direct quote) that would be useful for huge numbers of users. By the time AI hype really started to pick up, I had moved to a team working on internal tools. I wasn't building or evaluating machine learning models and I was outspoken about not wanting to do that. When LLM hype got really big, senior leadership started describing it as an "existential threat" (that is a direct quote as far as I remember), and re-organizing teams to get LLMs into Document Cloud as soon as possible. Adobe did not do *anything* quickly, so this was a huge change. A big red flag for me was that rather than building our own LLMs, Adobe used OpenAI's chatbots. When I asked about all of OpenAI's ethical and environmental issues, management made generic gestures towards being concerned but never actually said or did anything substantive about it. At that point I quit, because I had specifically been saying I didn't want to be involved in GenAI, and given the rushed and sloppy nature of the rollout, I didn't want my name anywhere near it. *Colleagues' reactions* Definitely I knew some colleagues who didn't like what Adobe was doing. There were a lot of people who privately agreed with me but publicly went along with the plan. Generally because they were worried about job security, but also there's a belief at Adobe that the company's approach to AI isn't perfect but it's more ethical than the competition. Despite being a huge company, teams were mostly isolated from each other, and as far as I know there wasn't a Slack channel for talking about AI concerns or anything like that. When I asked critical questions during department meetings or expressed frustration with leadership for ignoring concerns, people told me to go through the chain of command and not to be too confrontational. Looking back, I wish my goal hadn't been to persuade managers but instead to organize fellow workers. I was probably too timid in my attempts to organize. I do regret that I didn't try having more explicit 1-on-1's about this, even though it would have been risky. Obviously I was very lucky/privileged to have enough savings to even consider quitting or letting myself get fired in this shitty job market, and I often wonder if I could have done more to combine strategies and resources with other colleagues so that fighting back would be less risky for everyone. *Impact of AI on work* When the GenAI push started, a lot more of my colleagues started working nights and weekends, which was rare (and even discouraged) before then. Managers paid lip service to Adobe's continuing commitment to work-life balance, but in practice that didn't match up with the sense of urgency and the unrealistic deadlines. I'm not aware of anyone who got fired or laid off specifically because of getting replaced by AI, and it looks like teams are still hiring. Although for what it's worth, in general Adobe does not do layoffs these days, but instead they pressure people into quitting by taking work away from them, putting them on PIPs, that kind of thing. I found out that a colleague who had been struggling with a simple programming task for over a month—and refusing frequent offers for help—was struggling because they were trying to prompt an LLM for the solution and trying to understand the LLM's irrelevant and poorly-organized output. They could have finished the work in a day or two if they had just asked for help clarifying what they needed to do. I and their other teammates would gladly have provided non-judgmental support if they had asked. Our team found out that a software vendor (I can't say which one but it was one of the big companies pushing Agentic AI) was using AI to route our service request tickets. As a result, our tickets were being misclassified, which meant that they were failing to resolve high-priority service disruptions that we had reported. We wasted days on this, if not weeks. *My current job* At my current job, I'm basically a combination of programmer and database administrator. I like the work way more than what I did at Adobe. Much like the corporate world, there are a lot of middle and upper managers who want to "extract actionable insights" from data, but lack the information literacy and technical knowledge to understand what they can (or should) ask for. And the people below them are often unwilling to push back on unreasonable expectations. It's very frustrating to explain to executives that the marketing pitches they hear about AI are not reflective of reality. It makes us seem like we're afraid of change, or trying to prevent "progress" and "efficiency." So I would say the private and public sector have this in common: the higher up you go in the organization, the more enthusiastic people are about "AI,” and the less they understand about the software, and (not coincidentally) the less they understand what their department actually does. And to the extent that workers are opposed to "AI,” they're afraid of organizing, because it feels like executives are looking for reasons to cut staff. Tech worker. So this is sort of an anecdote in the opposite direction of AI taking jobs—in a recent interview process at a mature startup in the travel tech space, part of the offer negotiations were essentially me stating “yeah I don’t want to work here if you expect me to use or produce LLM-based features or products” (this is relevant as the role is staff data scientist, so ostensibly on supply side of AI tooling), and them responding with “yeah if you want to do LLM work this isn’t the place for you.” Though my network isn’t extensive, I feel like this is a growing sentiment in the small- and medium-tech space - my primary social media is on a tech-centric instance of the fediverse (hachyderm.io) and more often than not when I see the #GetFediHired hashtag, it’s accompanied by something akin to “no crypto, no AI” (also no Microsoft Teams, but I digress). Computer programmer. Our department has now brought in copilot, and we are being encouraged to use it for writing and reviewing code. Obviously we are told that we need to review the AI outputs, but it is starting to kill my enjoyment for my work; I love the creative problem solving aspect to programming, and now the majority of that work is trying to be passed onto AI, with me as the reviewer of the AI's work. This isn't why I joined this career, and it may be why I leave it if it continues to get worse. Software engineer at a large tech firm. All my life, I’ve wanted to be an artist. Any kind of artist. I still daydream of a future where I spend my time frolicking in my own creativity while my own work brings me uninterrupted prosperity. Yet this has not come to pass, and despite graduate level art degrees, the only income I can find is the result of a second-class coding job for a wildly capitalist company. It’s forty hours a week of the dullest work imaginable, but it means I have time to indulge in wishful thinking and occasionally, a new guitar. Real use cases where AI can be used to do work that regular old programming could not are so rare that when I discovered one two weeks ago, I asked for a raise in the same breath as the pitch. I am experiencing exactly what you describe. There’s been layoffs recently, and my company is investing heavily in AI, even though they’re not sure yet how best to make it do anything that our corporate overlords imagine it should do. From the c-level, they push around ideas about how we could code AI to do work, but in reality, those on the ground are only using AI to help write code that does the work, as the code always has. Real use cases where AI can be used to do work that regular old programming could not are so rare that when I discovered one two weeks ago, I asked for a raise in the same breath as the pitch. And here I am, five hundred words into this little essay, and I’ve barely touched on AI! Nor have I even touched any of the AI tools that are so proudly thrust into my face to produce this. I’ve played around with AI tools for creative writing, and while they’re good at fixing my most embarrassing grammar errors, none of them have helped me in my effort to bridge the gap between my humble talent as a creative and my aspirations for my effort. There’s a meme going on Pinterest that I believe sums up this moment: “We wanted robots to clean the dishes and do our laundry, so we could draw pictures and write stories. Instead they gave us robots to draw pictures and write stories, so we could clean dishes and do laundry.” This feels very true in the sense that human talent is getting valued not for the time it took to gain it and the ingenuity it proves, but for how well it feeds the greed of those who can afford to invest in bulk. But art in capitalism has always been this way, hasn’t it? If we don’t have a patron, we might as well eat our paint, and AI only tightens that grip that the privileged have held us in for centuries. I’ve never been so fortunate to consider the work that funds my DoorDash addiction to be my passion’s output, and perhaps that’s why I’m not afraid of what I’ll lose. But it’s that same work that has me sharing notes with fellow programmers, and many of them will say with blunt honesty that they’re worried they’ll be replaced by AI. This is a vulnerability I rarely see from the group of people who often elevated their work as valuable and practical, as opposed to my efforts to learn how to make music and poetry, which were wasteful and useless. But I am like a plant that learned how to grow on rocks and eat insects. In a meeting soon, I’m going to level with them: Don’t you understand? This work, what we do day in and day out for a soulless organization that drives profit from stealing our essence, this is the laundry! And if they think I’ll just throw that work into a machine and let it do all the work for me, they’re right. But it’s a machine that automates the work of running machines that automates the work that people used to do by hand, while constantly stealing glances at the clock, just waiting for the moment when they could be out from under the gaze of some righteous egomaniac. Maybe this is just the perspective of someone who’s seen her work, of almost any type, get devalued with such regularity that it’s hard to imagine the robots making it any more difficult than it already is. No one’s ever really cared about my Instagram posts. No one pretends that my code will change the world. Perhaps, someday, I’ll make more money while babysitting on the weekends. I spend a lot of time thinking about things that haven’t worked out for me, and for us, as a society, and I think some of our worst failures come from moments when we can’t differentiate between the ability to use machines and our abilities as machines. Last week I made a pie for my family, and I obviously didn’t get paid for it. Somewhere off in the offices of the illuminati, an account will calculate the value of the oven that baked the crust, the refrigerator that cooled the filling, the bougie pie dish that made my effort look food-blog ready. But there’s no monetary value in the work I did that literally put food on the table, and I rarely, if ever, get paid to perform the music I love, or receive more than pocket change for the short stories I publish. I keep thinking that the solution for both problems exist in some future innovation, but I can’t imagine what that invention would be, and I can’t find proof of a real connection between the two. Maybe ChatGPT knows the answer to this riddle? I can throw a penny into our new philosophy vending machine, but I might come up with a better answer myself if I think about it while I unload the dishwasher. PS I didn’t use ai to write this, also didn’t even bother to push it through an ai extruder to check the grammar. I guess I’m just feeling too lazy today to push that button! Have a nice weekend. [If your job has been impacted by AI, and you would like to share your story as part of this project, please do so at AIkilledmyjob@pm.me.] Fintech worker. Hello! I am a tech worker at a fintech. My workplace has been pushing AI really hard this year. Here's the latest thing they thought up: It 100% feels like testing the waters for just how unqualified and underpaid your workforce can be. Just as long as they can work the shovel of LLM they're good right? The children yearn for the (LLM) mines! Current CrowdStrike employee. I work for CrowdStrike, the leading cybersecurity company in the United States. As a current employee, I can't reveal specific details about myself. As you may have heard, CrowdStrike laid off 500 employees on May 7th, 2025. These were not underperformers. Many of them were relatively new hires. This action was presented as a strategic realignment with a special focus in "doubling down on our highest-impact opportunities," to quote CEO George Kurtz. In the internal email, he states further: AI investments accelerate execution and efficiency: AI has always been foundational to how we operate. AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster. It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office. AI is a force multiplier throughout the business. So, AI has literally killed many jobs at CrowdStrike this week. I'm fortunate to be among the survivors, but I don't know for how long. Generative AI, particularly LLMs, is permeating every aspect of the company. It's in our internal chats. It's integrated into our note-taking tools. It's being used in triage, analysis, engineering, and customer communications. Every week, I'm pinged in an announcement that some new AI capability has been rolled out to me and that I am expected to make use of it. Customers who are paying for live human service packages from us are increasingly getting the output of an LLM instead. Quality Assurance reviewers have started criticizing reviewees for failing to run things through AI tools for things as trivial as spelling and grammar. Check out the front page and count the number of times "AI" is mentioned. It didn't used to be like this. CrowdStrike is currently achieving record financials. At the time I write this, CRWD is trading at $428.63 in striking range of the stock's 52-week high. The efforts of my colleagues and I to rebuild from the incident of July 19, 2024 have been rewarded with shareholder approval and 500 layoffs. Some of the impacted individuals were recent graduates of 4-year schooling who, in addition to student loans, have moving expenses because they physically relocated to Texas shortly before this RIF occurred. Many lower-level employees at CrowdStrike are big fans of generative AI; as techy people in a techy job, they fit the bill for that. Even so, many of them have become wary… of what increased AI adoption means for them and their colleagues. Some of the enthusiastic among them are beginning to realize that they're training the means of additional layoffs—perhaps their own. CrowdStrikers have been encouraged to handle the additional per capita workload by simply working harder and sometimes working longer for no additional compensation on either count. While our Machine Learning systems continue to perform with excellence, I have yet to be convinced that our usage of genAI has been productive in the context of the proofreading, troubleshooting, and general babysitting it requires. Some of the genAI tools we have available to us are just completely useless. Several of the LLMs have produced inaccuracies which have been uncritically communicated to our customers by CrowdStrikers who failed to exhibit due diligence. Those errors were caught by said customers, and they were embarrassing to us all. I would stop short of saying that the existence of genAI tools within the company is directly increasing the per capita workload, but an argument could be made of it indirectly accomplishing that. The net result is not a lightening of the load as has been so often promised. Morale is at an all-time low. Many survivors have already started investigating their options to leave either on their own terms or whenever the executives inevitably decide an LLM is adequate enough to approximately replace us. The company is very proud of its recognitions as an employer. As CrowdStrikers, we used to be proud of it too. Now we just feel betrayed. Software engineer, health tech startup. I work as a software engineer and we've been getting a push to adopt AI coding assistants in the last few months. I tried it, mostly to be able to critique, and found it super annoying, so I just stopped using it. But I'm starting to get worried. Our CEO just posted this in an internal AI dedicated Slack channel. The second message is particularly concerning. [It’s a screenshot of a message containing a comment from another developer. It reads:] "I am sufficiently AI-pilled to think that if you aren't using agentic coding tools, then you are the problem. They are good enough now that it's a skills issue. Almost everyone not using them will be unemployed in 2 years and won't know why (since they're the ones on Hacker News saying "these tools never work for me!" and it turns out they are using very bad prompts and are super defensive about it)." We've had some layoffs long before this AI wave and the company has not picked up the pace in terms of hiring since. I'm sure now they're thinking twice before hiring anyone though. The biggest change was in how the management is enthusiastically incentivizing us to start using AI. First they offered coding assistants for everyone to use, then the hackdays we had every semester turned into a week long hackathon specifically focused on AI projects. Now we have an engineer, if you can call him that, working on a project that will introduce more than 30k lines of AI generated code into our codebase, without a single unit test. It will be impossible to do a proper code review on this much code and it will become a maintenance nightmare and possibly a security hazard. I don't need to tell you how much management is cheering on that. Front end software engineer at a major software company. My job hasn't been killed yet, but there's definitely a possibility that it could be soon. I work for a major software company as a front end software engineer. I believe that there's been AI-related development for about a year and a half. It's a little hard to nail down exactly because I'm one of the few remaining US-based developers and the majority of our engineering department is in India. The teams are pretty siloed and the day-to-day of who's on what teams and what they're doing is pretty opaque. There's been a pretty steady increase of desire and pressure to start using AI tools for a while now. As a result, timelines have been getting increasingly shorter, likewise the patience of upper management. They've tried to create tools that would help with some of the day-to-day repeatable UI pieces that I work on, but the results were unusable from my end and I found that I can create them on my own in the same amount of time. The agents themselves had names and AI-generated profile pictures of minorities that aren't actually represented in the upper levels of the company, which I find kind of gross. Around October/November of last year, the CEO and President (who's the former head of Product) had decided to go all-in on AI development and integrate it in all aspects of our business. Not just engineering, but all departments (Sales, Customer Operations, People Operations, etc). Don't get a ton of insight from other departments other than I've heard that Customer Ops is hemorrhaging people and the People Ops sent an email touting that we could now use AI to write recognition messages to each other celebrating workplace successes (insulting and somewhat dystopian). On the engineering side, I think initially there was a push to be an AI leader in supply chain, so there were a lot of training courses, hackathons and (for India) AI-focused off-sites where they wanted to get broad adoption of AI tools and ideas for products that we can use AI in. Then in February, the CEO declared that what we have been doing is no longer a growth business and we were introducing an AI control tower and agents, effectively making us an AI first company. The agents themselves had names and AI-generated profile pictures of minorities that aren't actually represented in the upper levels of the company, which I find kind of gross. Since then, the CEO has been pretty insistent about AI in every communication and therefore there's an increased downward pressure to use it everywhere. He has never been as involved in the day-to-day workings of the company as he has been about AI. Most consequential is somewhere he has gotten the idea that because code can now be generated in a matter of minutes, whole SAS6 applications, like the ones we've been developing for years, can be built in a matter of days. He's read all these hype articles declaring 60-75% increase in engineering productivity. I guess there was a competitor in one of our verticals that has just come on the scene and done basically what our app can do, but with more functionality. A number things could explain this, but the conclusion has been that they used AI and made our app in a month. So ever since then, it's been a relentless stream of pressure to fully use AI everywhere to "improve efficiency" and get things out as fast as possible. They've started mandating tracking AI usage in our JIRA stories7, the CEO has led Engineering all-hands8 (he has no engineering background), and now he is mandating that we go from idea to release in a single sprint (2 weeks) or be able to explain why we're not able to meet that goal. I've been working under increasingly more compressed deadlines for about a year and am pretty burned out right now, and we haven't even started pushing the AI warp speed churn that they've proposed recently. It's been pretty well documented how inaccurate and insecure these LLMs are and, for me, it seems like we're on a pretty self-destructive path here. We ostensibly do have a company AI code of conduct, but I don't know how this proposed shift in engineering priority doesn't break every guideline. I'm not the greatest developer in the world, but I try to write solid code that works, so I've been very resistant to using LLMs in code. I want my work to be reliable and understandable in case it does need to be fixed. I don't have time to mess around and go down rabbit holes that the code chatbots would inevitably send me down. So I foresee the major bugs and outages just sky-rocketing under this new status quo. How they pitch it to us is that we can generate the code fast and have plenty of time to think about architecture, keep a good work/life balance, etc. But in practice, we will be under the gun of an endless stream of 2 week deadlines and management that won't be happy at how long everything takes or the quality of the output. The people making these decisions love the speed of code generation but never consider the accuracy and how big the problem is of even small errors perpetuated at scale. No one else is speaking up to these dangers, but I feel like if I do (well, more loudly than just to immediate low-level managers), I'll be let go. It's pretty disheartening and I would love to leave, but of course it's hard to find another job competing with all the other talented folks that have been let go through all this. Working in software development for so long and seeing so many colleagues accept that we are just prompt generators banging out substandard products has been rough. I'm imagining this must be kind of what it feels like to be in a zombie movie. I'm not sure how this all turns out, but it doesn't look great at the moment. The one funny anecdote during all this AI insanity is they had someone from GitHub demo do a live presentation on Co-Pilot and the agents. Not only was everything he demoed either unreliable or underwhelming, but he could not stop yawning loudly during his own presentation. Even the AI champions are tired. Less than a month later, the engineer emailed me a followup. And I just got laid off yesterday. The reason cited was they need full stack developers and want engineers that are in India, and not for performance. My front-end-focused position was rendered obsolete. Very plausible since they definitely prefer hiring young and less expensive developers abroad. So AI is not technically the direct cause, but definitely a factor in the background. They'll hire a bunch of new graduates to churn out whatever AI solutions that they think they can hype. Annoyingly, they did announce two new AI agents yesterday, again with faces and names of women. The positive is that they did give me a decent severance, so in the short term I'm fine, financially but also that I don't have to deal with the pressure of ridiculous deadlines. Edtech worker. I work for a small edtech startup and do all of our marketing, communications, and social media. I've always enjoyed doing our ed policy newsletter and other writing related projects. My boss absolutely loves AI, but until recently I'd been able to avoid it. A few weeks ago, my boss let me know that all of my content writing would now be done on ChatGPT so I would have more time to work on other projects. He also wants me to use AI to generate images of students, which I've luckily been able to push back on. Although he says it's a time saver, I don't actually have other projects, so not only am I creating complete slop, but I'm also left with large amounts of time to do nothing. Being forced to use AI has turned a job I liked into something I dread. As someone with a journalism background, it feels insulting to use AI instead of creating quality blog posts about education policy. Unfortunately, as a recent grad, I haven't had much luck finding another job despite applying to hundreds, so for now I have to make do with the situation, but I will say that having to use AI is making me reconsider where I'm working. Senior developer at a cloud company. I work for a cloud service provider (who will retaliate if you don't post this anonymously, unfortunately), and they're absolutely desperate for the current AI fad to be useful for something. They're completely ignoring the environmental costs (insane power requirements, draining lakes of freshwater for cooling, burning untold CPU and GPU hours that could be dedicated to something useful instead) because there's a buck to be made. They hope. But they're still greenwashing the company of course. For cloud companies, AI is a gold rush; until the bubble bursts, they can sell ridiculous amounts of expensive server time (lots and lots of CPU/GPU/memory/storage) and tons of traffic to and from the models. They're selling shovels to the gold miners, and are in a great position to charge rent if someone strikes a vein of usefulness. I can see a scenario coming fast that's going to set back software development by years But they're desperate for this to keep going. They're demanding we use AI for literally everything in our jobs. Our managers want to know what we're using AI for and what AI "innovations" we've come up with. If we're not using AI for everything, they want to know why not. I don't think we're quite at the point of this being part of our performance evaluations, but the company is famously opaque about that, so who knows. It's certainly something the employees worry about. My work involves standards compliance. Using AI for any part of it will literally double our work load because we'll have to get it to do the thing, and then carefully review and edit the output for accuracy. You can't do compliance work with vibes. What's the point of burning resources to summarize things when you need to review the original and then the output for accuracy anyway? I can see a scenario coming fast that's going to set back software development by years (decades? who knows!): C-suite: we don't need these expensive senior developers, interns can code with AI C-suite: we don't need these expensive security developers, AI can find the problems senior developers are laid off, or quit due to terrible working conditions (we're already seeing this) they're replaced with junior developers, fresh out of school... cheap, with no sense of work-life balance, and no families to distract them all the vibe coding goes straight to production because, obviously, we trust the AI and don't know any better; also we've been told to use AI for everything at some point, all the bugs and security vulnerabilities make everything so bad it actually starts impacting the bottom line uh oh, the vibe coders never progressed beyond junior skill levels, so nobody can do the code reviews, nobody can find and fix the security problems if all the fired senior developers haven't retired or found other jobs (a lot of these people want to get out of tech, because big tech has made everything terrible), they'll need to be hired back, hopefully at massive premiums due to demand If these tools were generally useful, they wouldn't need to force them on us, we'd be picking them up and running with them. At first, the exec’s AI speech was greeted by the typical heart-eyes and confetti emojis, but then I saw there were a few thumbs-down emojis thrown into the mix. This was shocking enough on its own, but then the thumbs-downs multiplied, tens and hundreds of them appearing on the screen, making those few little confettis seem weak and pathetic. I was already floored at this point, and then someone posted the first tomato… Tech worker at a well-known tech company. I work at a fairly well-known tech company currently trying to transform itself from a respected, healthy brand to a win-at-all-costs hyperscaler. The result has mostly been a lot of bullshit marketing promises pegged to vaporware, abrupt shifts in strategy that are never explained, and most of all, the rapid degrading of a once healthy, candid corporate culture into one that is intolerant of dissent, enforces constant positivity, and just this week, ominously announced that we are “shifting to a high-performance culture.” The company leadership also recently (belatedly) declared that “we are going all in on AI.” I don’t use AI. I morally object to it, for reasons I hardly need to explain to you. And now I feel like I’m hiding plain sight, terrified someone will notice I’m actually doing all my own work. We’re hiring for new roles and have been explicitly told that no candidate will be considered for *any* job unless they’re on board with AI. Every department has to show how they’re “incorporating AI into their workflows.” I heard through the grapevine that anyone so much as expressing skepticism “does not have a future with the company.” It is pretty bleak. I’d leave, but I keep hearing it’s the same everywhere. But then something insane happened. At the most recent company all-hands, typically the site of the post painful sycophancy, one of our executives gave a speech formally announcing our big AI gambit. The meeting is so big that there is no Zoom chat, so people can only directly react via emojis. At first, the exec’s AI speech was greeted by the typical heart-eyes and confetti emojis, but then I saw there were a few thumbs-down emojis thrown into the mix. This was shocking enough on its own, but then the thumbs-downs multiplied, tens and hundreds of them appearing on the screen, making those few little confettis seem weak and pathetic. I was already floored at this point, and then someone posted the first tomato. It caught on like wildfire until there were wave after wave of virtual tomatoes being thrown at the executive’s head—a mass outcry against being forced to embrace AI at gunpoint. He tried to keep going but his eyes kept darting to the corner of his screen where the emojis appeared, in increasing panic. It was goddamn inspiring. And while the executives didn’t immediately abandon all their AI plans, they are definitely shaken by what happened, and nervous about mass dissent. As they should be. Thanks again to every tech worker who shared their story to me, whether it was included here or not—and to every worker who has written in to AIkilledmyjob@pm.me, period. I intend to produce the next installment in coming weeks, so subscribe if below if that’s of interest. And if you’d like to support this work, and receive the paywalled Critical AI reports and special commentary, please consider becoming a paid subscriber. My wonderful paid subscribers are the only reason I am able to do any of this. A million thanks. Finally, one more time with feeling: If your job has been impacted by AI, and you would like to share your story as part of this project, please do so at AIkilledmyjob@pm.me. If you’re willing to participate in an on-camera interview, contact us at AIkilledmyjob@perfectunion.us. Thanks everyone—until next time. The two footnotes in this account were provided by the worker, and are presented exactly as shared. The first is this link: https://www.gitclear.com/coding_on_copilot_data_shows_ais_downward_pressure_on_code_quality like how Google Docs signals typos, an example: https://superuser.com/questions/1796376/getting-rid-of-the-red-squiggly-underline-on-errors Editor’s note: RIF is “reduction in force.” Ed: Chief Marketing Officer. Ed: PIP stands for Performance Improvement Plan — in tech, getting a PIP, or PIPd, is like getting an official warning that you’re underperforming and thus more likely to get terminated. Ed: Software as a service. Ed: Jira is project management and bug-tracking software. Ed: All-hands are meetings where everyone from the entire company or department are required to attend. ''I feel like I’m hiding plain sight, terrified someone will notice I’m actually doing all my own work.'' What a backwards world we live in. This needs to be repeated, highlighted and shoved in every AI sycophant, Wall Street stock monkey or big tech executives face till they are forced to counter it: Forced adoption is not adoption. Just because you have faked the metric does not mean you have made it. Bullshit metrics rigging is the name of the game now. Wall Streets, pro-monopoly, pro-fascist and anti-worker machine of auto-pumping any stock that monopolises, lays off workers and "adopts AI" has empowered the cabal of Mckinseyists, C-execs and technofascists against the people. First it was monthly active users: cue AI companies giving away products for free, or forcing them in products that already have success. The desperation at Google to brag about MAU after forcing it in Google search, Android, Lens and soon to be Gmail. On its own, the Gemini app is a complete flop. Then it was tokens, a bullshit metric when one realises, a) adoption has been forced (workers forced to use code assistants, Google auto-generating AI overviews in search) and b) token ouput has increased by 100x since the release of "reasoning" models. Now its adoption. Don't you know, 30% of all code is now AI generated (oh we've included auto-complete in that wink wink). Workers are adopting AI faster than any prior technology!, the McKinseyist says. No shit, execs are literally threatening to fire people if they don't use it. A farce if there ever was one. The reason they are hopping desperately from one metric to another, is because for 3 years and still to this day, they have been unable to address the elephant in the room. AI is not valued by the people and makes little to no money. $600B+ spent and <$20B revenue. Take away the foundation models, and its <5B revenue. The best selling AI SaaS product is a code assistant making 0.5B revenue. MSFT Azure AI is making as little as $2B. MSFT, Google, Salesforce, Adobe have pulled their standalone AI products and now forcefully bundle AI alongside a mandatory price increase due to how bad the sales were as a standalone. They run away from revenue and profit metrics because it shows the world how much of a flop their project has been. Anytime you want an AI exec or shill to squirm just ask these two things. Its time for workers and the people to form a class, a class far more powerful, against the machine. Across so many industries, people have not only rejected AI slop but actively hate on it and try to ruin its image: see the recent humiliation of Klarna, Suno, Duolingo, MSFT Gaming and Meta. It is working. Public backlash breeds more public backlash. A wonderful flywheel of AI hate. The people continuing to reject AI will kill the AI industry. Most the money has to eventually come from the consumer. No posts Ready for more?

Title: Black Friday Email Marketing Strategy: 10 Tips and Examples (2025) - Shopify Australia

Time Published: 2025-06-27T23:24:32Z

Black Friday is one of the biggest sales events of the year. Last year, Shopify merchants drove a record-breaking $11.5 billion in sales during the Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) weekend. With so many consumers open to shopping during the holiday weekend, leaning on tried and tested marketing channels can open the floodgates to more revenue in the fourth quarter. For many retailers, that’s email marketing. Email is the third-most influential channel on holiday purchase decisions, beating influencer endorsements, in-person experiences, and conversations with retail associates in-store. But when so many retailers rely on this direct line of communication to promote holiday sales, it’s difficult to stand out in a subscriber’s crowded inbox. This guide shares innovative Black Friday email marketing strategies to try this year, with best practices and examples from leading retailers. Customer data is the most valuable asset any ecommerce business has. It allows you to tailor email outreach and deliver on customers’ expectations for a personalized shopping experience. Yet 85% of internet users want to do more to protect their online privacy, meaning this strategy can be difficult to implement. Before the holiday season arrives, take stock of the customer data you currently have. If your email list is small or you don’t have supplementary information to personalize campaigns to existing subscribers, deploy lead generation campaigns to gather more holiday season customer data. For example: Because Shopify offers a customer data platform (CDP) by default, any first-party data you’ve collected on your customers gets combined in a unified customer profile. Whenever they share their email address or phone number, this data—such as their order history, loyalty points they’ve earned, previous emails they’ve opened, and/or customer service tickets they’ve raised—all funnel back to one place, giving you one source of truth for every shopper. Black Friday might only last one day, but consumers are still open to making holiday purchases in the run up to the big event. Klaviyo found that more than half of consumers think a month earlier than November is the ideal time for brands to initiate their holiday shopping season sales. Most retailers start seeding their Black Friday email promotions 21 days before the big event—a strategy dubbed “Black November,” which includes other holiday shopping dates: The majority of consumers look for discounts and sales during this period—so much so, 7 in 10 consider price the top factor in their holiday purchase decisions, beating quality (61%), variety (34%), and warranties or returns policies (31%). Take advantage of consumers’ openness to pre-Black Friday promotions by creating a holiday calendar. Perhaps you give your email list early access to your sale, or build hype around a new product drop by teasing it to subscribers, with an automated series like this: Not all holiday shoppers are the same. Some might be looking for gifts for a loved one—others might want to take advantage of a hefty discount to buy a product that’s been on their wishlist for months. Segmentation allows you to identify these buyer preferences and deliver personalized Black Friday email marketing campaigns. Key Black Friday customer segments to email include: Customers who’ve visited your New Orleans store within the last six months, for instance, could receive an email that invites them to your retail store’s exclusive holiday sale which starts two days before Black Friday. Yet instead of relying solely on historical data to forecast each segment’s next steps, lean on predictive analytics. These tools digest large datasets using machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately predict what a customer will do next. 💡Tip: Shopify’s segmentation features pull data from unified customer profiles to group customers based on qualities they share. Choose from prebuilt segment templates, or build your own with the ShopifyQL query editor. All segments are dynamic—subscribers will move in and out of segments automatically when data from their unified profile changes. Segmentation isn’t the only way to personalize emails around the Black Friday weekend. Dynamic content blocks adjust smaller sections of your email, instead of sending the same email to everyone who fits your segmentation criteria. Let’s say, for example, that you’ve defined a segment of VIP customers to target during Black Friday. Subscribers have one thing in common—they have a customer lifetime value of over $500—but they don’t all share the same buying behaviors. Some have saved the loyalty rewards they’ve earned—others have made a portion of their purchases in-store. Further personalize the Black Friday emails that each subscriber in this segment receives with dynamic content blocks. That could be: Black Friday sales are effective because they’re exclusive—either in terms of product quantity (for example, a limited amount of inventory) or because the promotion ends at a specific time. Lean into this time sensitivity and encourage Black Friday subscribers to take advantage now rather than later. This scarcity can induce the fear of missing out, a psychological phenomenon that influences people to buy even when they didn’t intend on doing so. Effective marketing techniques to create urgency in your Black Friday emails include: reMarkable, for example, has a countdown timer in their email to announce Black Friday is ending. It offers visual representation of when the deal ends, instead of just a generic “Sale ends tonight!” message. Email inboxes are a crowded place to be at the best of times—never mind on Black Friday, when every retailer wants to capitalize on consumers’ willingness to buy. Email marketing platform Omnisend processed 1.13 billion emails in the week surrounding BFCM. Klaviyo reported similar figures: at its peak, merchants sent 420 million messages in a single hour on Black Friday. An email subject line is the first thing that subscribers see when your campaign lands in their inbox. A best practice is to split-test strategies such as: Here are some real examples that incorporate these best practices and stood out to me during the Black Friday weekend last year: Promotions and flash drops can incentivize holiday shoppers to make impulsive purchases. Remove the biggest barrier to them doing so—finding the money to pay for their order—by offering buy now, pay later (BNPL). During the BFCM weekend last year, consumers spent over $686.3 million on BNPL purchases, up 8.8% from the year before. Of those who have used this type of service, almost a third say they’d be more likely to spend money on discretionary goods if the retailer offered BNPL as an option. Shop Pay Installments offers an easy way to add BNPL options at checkout. Customers can choose to divide their purchases into smaller, more manageable installments. Combined with Shop Pay, the best-converting checkout on the internet, it’s no surprise that Shop Pay Installments has been proven to reduce cart abandonment by 28% and increase average order value by as much as 50%. Email might be the only direct line of communication you have with Black Friday customers, but it’s not the only way to command their attention. SMS marketing is the easiest integration since most email marketing platforms, including Klaviyo, offer SMS integration as standard. For example, you could send an email campaign to a particular segment, then use SMS to follow up with those who haven’t yet redeemed the offer or opened the email. It’s an approach proven to get results: Klaviyo reports that merchants who integrated SMS into their Black Friday email marketing strategy experienced a 20% YoY increase in ecommerce revenue during BFCM, accounting for more than $100 million in gross merchandise value. Email can also complement paid advertising strategies as costs skyrocket throughout Black Friday season. Shopify Audiences builds custom retargeting lists to export to platforms like Meta, Google Ads, and TikTok. It’s helped merchants like Happy Hippo achieve a 4.7x return on ad spend (ROAS) while cutting customer acquisition costs (CAC) by 72%. “Shopify Audiences is a huge benefit for Plus merchants,” says CEO and lead product designer Adam Biel. “It has helped lower customer acquisition costs so our investments can stretch much further with Facebook ads.” Transactional emails tend to be overlooked when marketers attempt to compete with other retailers for attention during Black Friday. Yet they’re an opportunity to strengthen relationships with the customers you’ve already acquired. Comb through the automated emails you send as standard when customers complete a certain action. Here are some examples and ideas to optimize them: Black Friday, Cyber Monday regularly break records, but not all of them are good. Most customers acquired during BFCM have a lower lifetime value. This occurs partly because these customers were being opportunistic and taking advantage of your promotions, but also because your brand loses mindshare throughout the year. Design an email retention sequence to retain holiday shoppers after Black Friday ends. You could: 💡Tip: Shopify Flow takes the logistical hassle out of these holiday marketing automations. Work from prebuilt templates—such as inviting shoppers to your loyalty program when their unified customer profile meets specific criteria—or custom code your own. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of new promotions and segmentation strategies that turn email subscribers into paying customers—so much so, that retailers often forget the fundamentals. Here’s a quick reminder of the email optimization best practices to keep in mind while writing Black Friday emails: If you’re in the midst of a creative lull and are searching for ideas on how to make your Black Friday emails stand out, draw inspiration from these examples. Shoppers are especially prone to abandoning online carts in search of better Black Friday deals. This cart recovery email from Pulp & Press reminds each individual customer of the products they abandoned, with a reminder that it’s the biggest sale of the year—and that they should take advantage now, before the deal ends. Black Friday might be the biggest online sales event of the year, but it’s not always the most profitable. Discounts tend to lure in low-value customers who might only purchase from you when products are heavily discounted. Detox Market’s Black Friday email is a great example of how to combat this with tiered promotions. The more customers spend, the bigger the discount. Freaks of Nature leans into scarcity with their “almost gone” Black Friday email. The call to action button tells people to “secure” their shirt—more strategic than just “get yours today.” Plus, it uses price anchoring to showcase the before and after sale price of each bestseller. There are also direct checkout links for email subscribers to complete their purchases without searching the online store for the perfect item. It’s tempting to shout about your bestselling products or hefty discounts with innovative email designs. Home furnishings brand Revival takes a different approach. Instead, the brand shares a letter authored by their founder, which wishes them a wonderful holiday weekend with a gentle nudge to buy the item on their wishlist. The email also features a note beneath the sign-off that teases the following day’s email. This tactic can increase open rates during Black Friday—subscribers are already on the lookout for the campaign. With so much competition to reach your target market during Black Friday, leaning into your brand values can attract conscious consumers who care more about sticking to their morals than impressive discounts. Deodorant brand Fussy, for example, is a certified B-Corp that sells deodorants made with natural ingredients and refillable cases designed to reduce plastic waste. Their target audience cares about sustainability, hence why the retailer’s Black Friday email marketing strategy was to rename the event “Green Week.” Email marketing spans every stage of the customer journey, from aiding initial product discovery to encouraging customer retention. Shopify has everything you need to personalize this end-to-end experience, including unified customer profiles and segmentation to put your data to work. Plus, when holiday email campaigns drive record levels of website traffic, you don’t have to worry about outages or downtime. Shopify’s infrastructure handled over 57.3 PB of data, 1.19 trillion edge requests, and 10.5 trillion database queries during the last BFCM. It’s why leading brands like Represent, Knix, and Muscle Nation trust Shopify to capitalize on Black Friday sales. “Black Friday can be nerve-wracking,” says Stefan Lewis, chief digital officer at Represent. “But Shopify has always helped us in terms of increasing bandwidth and we’ve never run into any issues around site speed.” Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) email is a marketing strategy where retailers reach their target customers through targeted emails. These holiday campaigns typically include promotions, sales, discounts, gift suggestions, and product recommendations. To write an effective Black Friday email, lead with a time-sensitive offer in the subject line and header. Use mobile-first design, highlight bestsellers or exclusives, and include urgency-driven CTAs like “get yours before it’s too late.” The best time to send Black Friday emails is in the runup to the big event. Most consumers start holiday gift shopping before Black Friday arrives. A pre-launch campaign can ensure your brand is top of mind when they’re ready to buy. Use targeted emails to announce a Black Friday sale. Divide your audience into segments based on traits they share, and include contextual recommendations—for example, discounts on products similar to those they’ve bought.

Most consumers start holiday gift shopping before Black Friday arrives. A pre-launch campaign can ensure your brand is top of mind when they’re ready to buy. Use targeted emails to announce a Black Friday sale. Divide your audience into segments based on traits they share, and include contextual recommendations—for example, discounts on products similar to those they’ve bought.

Title: S&P 500 hits new record high despite U.S.-Canada trade tensions

Saturday, 28 Jun 2025 NEW YORK, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stock index S&P 500 closed at record high on Friday, despite a brief retreat following U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement on terminating all trade talks with Canada. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 432.43 points, or 1 percent, to 43,819.27, boosted by huge gains from Nike after a better-than-expected earnings report. The S&P 500 added 32.05 points, or 0.52 percent, to 6,173.07, a record close high for the first time since February. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 105.54 points, or 0.52 percent, to 20,273.46. Nine of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in green, with consumer discretionary and communication services leading the gainers by adding 1.78 percent and 1.55 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, energy and health led the laggards by losing 0.50 percent and 0.17 percent, respectively. Equities initially moved higher in the morning following comments by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who told Bloomberg News late Thursday that a framework agreement between China and the United States on trade had been finalized. However, momentum faded after Trump posted on Truth Social that negotiations with Canada were off, injecting fresh uncertainty into global trade dynamics. "I can see where the risks are here -- if the trade is just hype from the White House and no deals are really forthcoming, then this market is going to roll over," Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group. "Ultimately, this all comes back to growth in the U.S. economy and growth of earnings." On the economic front, U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 0.1 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, in line with expectations. The annual inflation rate came in at 2.3 percent, matching economists' forecasts. Core PCE price index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, increased by 0.2 percent for the month and 2.7 percent year over year, slightly above expectations of 0.1 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively. U.S. investor sentiment improved in June as inflation fears pulled back, according to the University of Michigan's latest survey released Friday. The headline sentiment reading rose to 60.7, up 16.3 percent from May and close to the Dow Jones estimate for 60.5. The index was still 11 percent below the same month a year ago. "Consumers continue to be concerned about the potential impact of tariffs, but at this time they do not appear to be connecting developments in the Middle East with the economy," survey director Joanne Hsu said in a statement. In corporate news, Nike led gains across major indexes, with its shares surging 15.19 percent after the company reported quarterly earnings that topped Wall Street estimates. The sportswear giant also unveiled plans to offset potential tariff-related headwinds, which investors viewed positively. Large-cap technology stocks were mixed. Tesla fell 1.34 percent, while Alphabet and Amazon gained more than 2 percent. Broadcom and Microsoft posted modest losses, while Nvidia and Meta Platforms were up more than 1 percent, continuing their recent upward momentum. U.S. stock markets have shown resilience in recent weeks amid volatile geopolitical and economic headlines, as investors assess trade developments and incoming economic data for clues on the Fed's next moves.

Update font size. Reset Beleaguered Intel has started layoffs in California as part of a cost-cutting and restructuring plan led by CEO Lip-Bu Tan. This follows Tan’s August announcement that job cuts were inevitable, targeting a 15% to 20% reduction in the company’s workforce. Anton Shilov for Tom’s Hardware: ‎ Officially, Intel is eliminating excessive management layers, but a CRN report indicates that the company is surprisingly laying off chip design engineers and architects. Additionally, the company is shutting down its automotive chip division, according to Oregon Live. Among the job categories being eliminated are 22 physical design engineers, three physical design engineering managers, and several logic and product development engineers. The company is also removing roles such as cloud software architects and engineering managers, in addition to positions tied to business and project management, including a vice president of IT and multiple technology strategy leads. Employees in California are engaged in the development of CPU and GPU products… The layoffs are scheduled to begin on July 15. Impacted employees have been given either a 60-day notice or a shorter four-week notice, paired with nine weeks of compensation and benefits. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: As we wrote over twelve years ago: [Intel’s decision to pass on Apple’s iPhone] has to be close to the top of the list of Biggest Business Mistakes in History. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

The falling/failing of such a once-great American company saddens. May they find somewhere/in someone a bit of the startup vigor. Then please, share some w AAPL before the iPh annuity money stalls. So, no Mac news again today? How many employees does beleaguered anti-cook daily “news” have? What patents has it filed? How much money does it return to its investors?

ByMoneyShow ByMoneyShow, Contributor. Big Tech is back in the driver’s seat! The technology sector has been leading the market rally off the early-April lows – with sizable double-digit gains piling up. Here are three ways you can profit, courtesy of top MoneyShow experts. Mike Larson MoneyShow.com Big Tech is SO back. Again. Ever since the stock market bottomed out on April 7, we’ve seen most (though not ALL) of the biggest technology stocks rocket higher. All but two are outperforming smaller-capitalization stocks, as represented by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), as well as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) -- as you can see in this MoneyShow Chart of the Day. Big Tech SPY IWM Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) is the Big Tech name with the most post-“Liberation Day” juice – up 58%. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) isn’t far behind, with a 40.4% rally. Next are Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Meta Platforms Inc. (META), both nipping at Tesla’s heels with gains of 37.8% and 37.3%. Only Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) are notably lagging (+11.2% and +16.4%, respectively). What’s behind the resumption of the Big Tech trade – a trade that has periodically popped back up over the past year or two? A few things... First, investors are boosting bets on earlier Federal Reserve rate cuts. Lower rates help boost growth-stock multiples. Second, concerns about tariff and trade policy have eased. President Trump has dialed backed some of his most punitive tariffs – and signaled a willingness to keep negotiating with trade partners. That could prevent some of the worst-case tech supply chain scenarios from playing out. Third, FOMO is back in play. Investors got too bearish during the declines, didn’t get on board early enough in the subsequent rally, and they’re now dog-piling into old favorites to play catch up. Add it all up and you have a tech sector that is leading again – and driving the averages to new highs. From where I sit, that’s bullish…and underscores why my “Be (Selectively) Bold” approach (still) looks like the right one here. Joe Markman Digital Creators & Consumers It’s happening in real-time, yet most investors remain completely oblivious. The “it” is the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, the greatest productivity accelerant since electricity. Let’s talk about what it means for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). According to a report on Bloomberg, MSFT is planning to cut thousands of jobs in its Xbox gaming division. These cuts will be in addition to the 6,000 employees fired in May at LinkedIn and other Microsoft subsidiaries. This is a sticky subject. There is going to be massive disruption. But it is a wonderful time to be a Microsoft shareholder. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Analysts scoffed at Magnificent Seven corporate leaders when they kept increasing capital expenditures for AI infrastructure. Research suggested that the companies would never earn a return on that invested capital because they couldn’t imagine a large-enough business to justify the investment. When Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, invested $10 billion in OpenAI two years ago, Wall Street analysts thought he had lost his mind. There was no demand for another Siri, they wrote. What the analysts missed then is that ChatGPT, OpenAI’s flagship product, isn’t Siri. ChatGPT can write software code, while Siri can barely play songs on Apple Music. Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) digital assistant was never going to succeed, mostly due to corporate culture. The iPhone maker is a hardware company. But executives at the other Mag-7 companies live and breathe software. They understood immediately what ChatGPT was, and they went all-in on AI. Make no mistake: layoffs at the biggest software companies are about to become much more common. This is because large portions of software employees can be replaced with AI. In the same way that electricity enabled mechanized, automated production that required fewer workers to achieve greater output, AI software is going to hollow out large parts of white-collar work. These changes will happen swiftly and persistently, as they are now occurring at Microsoft. In the past, foundational technology shifts have led to greater employment as new sectors and businesses were born. Pessimists said the Internet was going to shutter the global economy. More than two decades later, it turns out that connecting the entire world to a network led to millions of new jobs in the digital economy and employment in business verticals that previously did not exist. The flip side for investors is that productivity means increased profits. When headcounts are lower, more money flows to the bottom line. None of this is being reflected currently in share price valuations. Expect this to change in the second half of 2025 as hyperscalers talk about doing more with less, much to the surprise of the Wall Street analyst community. Recommended Action: Buy MSFT. George Gilder Gilder’s Technology Report The market capitalization leaderboard for semiconductors continues to highlight the divergence between IP ownership and physical production. US firms dominate the top rankings — Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) at $2.476 trillion, Broadcom Inc.

This valuation gap reflects investor focus on scalability and software leverage. Top 10 Semiconductors In today’s semiconductor market, location defines exposure, not necessarily strength. Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) — all US-headquartered — are rewarded for their innovation, commanding premium valuations and massive market capitalizations. But their products are inseparable from the Asian manufacturing ecosystem. TSMC, Samsung, and ASML remain irreplaceable at the physical layer of chip production. Tariffs, meanwhile, distort incentives. They penalize final assembly hubs like China without reshoring critical stages such as wafer fabrication or back-end packaging. This imbalance creates investment opportunities — and risks. US design-centric firms gain margin leverage, but companies controlling equipment, lithography, or memory — like ASML, Applied Materials, and SK Hynix — are the real backbone of global production. Investors should pay close attention to companies bridging these two worlds: Those that own irreplaceable manufacturing capacity and are structurally tied to Western markets. ASML and TSM remain critical infrastructure. Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT), Lam Research Corp. (LRCX), and KLA Corp. (KLAC) control the tools that keep fabs alive. Nvidia and Broadcom may lead the stock market — but it’s the factory floor that decides who can actually deliver.

The technology sector has been leading the market rally off the early-April lows – with sizable double-digit gains piling up. Here are three ways you can profit, courtesy of top MoneyShow experts. Mike Larson MoneyShow.com Big Tech is SO back. Again. Ever since the stock market bottomed out on April 7, we’ve seen most (though not ALL) of the biggest technology stocks rocket higher. All but two are outperforming smaller-capitalization stocks, as represented by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), as well as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) -- as you can see in this MoneyShow Chart of the Day. Big Tech SPY IWM Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) is the Big Tech name with the most post-“Liberation Day” juice – up 58%. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) isn’t far behind, with a 40.4% rally. Next are Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Meta Platforms Inc. (META), both nipping at Tesla’s heels with gains of 37.8% and 37.3%. Only Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) are notably lagging (+11.2% and +16.4%, respectively). What’s behind the resumption of the Big Tech trade – a trade that has periodically popped back up over the past year or two? A few things... First, investors are boosting bets on earlier Federal Reserve rate cuts. Lower rates help boost growth-stock multiples. Second, concerns about tariff and trade policy have eased. President Trump has dialed backed some of his most punitive tariffs – and signaled a willingness to keep negotiating with trade partners. That could prevent some of the worst-case tech supply chain scenarios from playing out. Third, FOMO is back in play. Investors got too bearish during the declines, didn’t get on board early enough in the subsequent rally, and they’re now dog-piling into old favorites to play catch up.

Title: Nvidia breakout puts $4 trillion market value within reach

Time Published: 2025-06-27T16:26:48Z
Full Content:
Two years after Nvidia Corp. made history by becoming the first chipmaker to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization, an even more remarkable milestone is within its grasp: becoming the first company to reach $4 trillion. After the emergence of China’s DeepSeek sent the stock plunging earlier this year and stoked concerns that outlays on artificial intelligence infrastructure were set to slow, Nvidia shares have rallied back to a record. Its biggest customers remain full steam ahead on spending, much of which is flowing to its computing systems. A 66% gain from an April low has pushed its market capitalization to $3.8 trillion, overtaking Microsoft Corp. at $3.70 trillion to again become the world’s most valuable company. Nvidia shares rose as much as 1.3% in early trading Friday. With a broadening customer base clamoring for Nvidia’s latest AI accelerators and competitors still distant, bulls are betting the chipmaker’s shares have plenty of room to run. “We believe that Nvidia is truly uniquely positioned, and that it will sustain its position over the next decade-plus,” said Aziz Hamzaogullari, chief investment officer at Loomis, Sayles & Co. and founder of the firm’s growth equity strategies team. Hamzaogullari isn’t alone. This week, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised Nvidia’s price target to $250 from $175, a level that would equate to a roughly $6 trillion market value. Baruah, who has a buy rating on the stock, expects annual AI spending from various types of customers to rise to nearly $2 trillion by 2028. “While it may seem fantastic that Nvidia fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that Nvidia remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,” Baruah wrote in a research note on June 25. The bullish sentiment behind Nvidia and other makers of AI gear is a stark reversal from earlier in the year when the emergence of advanced chatbots like DeepSeek, developed relatively cheaply in China, sparked fears that Nvidia’s customers would cut spending. Instead, US tech giants are plowing even more money into computing infrastructure. Read More: Nvidia Attempts to Breakout of Range Relative to the S&P 500 Microsoft, Meta, Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are projected to put about $350 billion into capital expenditures in their upcoming fiscal years, up from $310 billion in the current year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Those companies account for more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue. Of course, there are still plenty of risks that could derail Nvidia’s rally. The company relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for the production of its chips, exposing Nvidia to US President Donald Trump’s trade policies, which can change on a whim. Trump’s 90-day pause on the stiffest tariffs is set to end on July 9. At the same time, there’s no guarantee Nvidia’s biggest customers won’t change their tune on spending in coming years. Many of them are developing their own chips to avoid the steep prices commanded by Nvidia. “The valuation depends on the persistence of growth, and we already know that Nvidia’s largest customers are trying to figure out ways to be more efficient with their spending, not just with Nvidia, but also offloading to their own silicon,” said Dan Davidowitz, chief investment officer at Polen Capital Management. “You have to have very robust assumptions to get comfortable with the valuation, and we just don’t have a good enough view on what that demand looks like.” Nvidia shares are priced at 32 times earnings projected over the next 12 months, compared with 22 times for the S&P 500. The stock’s valuation doesn’t bother Loomis Sayles’s Hamzaogullari, who remains a firm believer that AI will transform society and is convinced that Nvidia will remain a key winner as productivity gains from the technology expand. “That doesn’t mean it will be steady Eddie all the time, that there won’t be disruptions in spending, but this is a secular structural change, and Nvidia remains one of the biggest beneficiaries,” Hamzaogullari said. “The stock still looks attractive given that backdrop.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Bitcoin FOMO: Billionaire Admits Mistake For ‘Not Being Involved’

Philippe Laffont—the billionaire behind Coatue Management—went and dropped Bitcoin into his “Fantastic 40,” his own shortlist of what he thinks will shine as top investments over the next five years. Laffont ranked Bitcoin alongside Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta, while leaving out Apple and Google. He says waking up at 3 a.m. wondering why he missed out drove him to rethink his stance. Based on reports from CNBC, he hasn’t bought any yet but thinks its market cap could jump past $5 trillion by 2030. That would put it in the same league as the biggest tech names. According to his own research, the Coatue Management big boss sees Microsoft climbing to a $5.7 trillion valuation and Nvidia reaching $5.6 trillion in the next five years. He paints Bitcoin as a rival asset, forecasting it will more than double from roughly $2.1 trillion today. He says the world’s net worth of $450–500 trillion gives room for new winners. Equities sit near $120 trillion and gold above and under ground at about $20 trillion. His case rests on bigger acceptance and smoother swings in price. Based on his figures, Bitcoin must average around 10–15% annual growth to hit $5 trillion by 2030. He sees volatility shrinking from daily moves of 5–7% to roughly half of that. That, he says, makes the crypto feel more like the Nasdaq. The tycoon points to de-dollarization as another tailwind. If global players shift away from the US dollar, Bitcoin could pick up more steam. Not everyone is convinced. Eric Semler of Semler Scientific notes lots of hedge funds still doubt Bitcoin’s staying power. They worry momentum will vanish once the US President Donald Trump factor fades. Meanwhile, Bybit’s Shunyet Jan forecasts Bitcoin at $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends hold. Crypto analyst Scott Melker goes even further, predicting a surge to $250,000 by end-2025 thanks to more big investors jumping in. Semler Scientific already holds 4,450 BTC. The firm plans to build that to 10,000 by year-end. Its chairman says many peers aren’t ready to follow suit. They see Bitcoin as too tied to politics. That caution keeps some big wallets on the sidelines. Regulatory moves remain the biggest wild card. Harsh rules could stall growth and scare off new buyers. Competition is rising too. Ether staking, Layer 2 networks and central bank digital currencies might chip away at Bitcoin’s crown. And a strong rebound in the US dollar or a broad stock sell-off could pull crypto down with it.

Title: Biased echoes: Large language models reinforce investment biases and increase portfolio risks of private investors

Large language models are increasingly used by private investors seeking financial advice. The current paper examines the potential of these models to perpetuate investment biases and affect the economic security of individuals at scale. We provide a systematic assessment of how large language models used for investment advice shape the portfolio risks of private investors. We offer a comprehensive model of large language model investment advice risk, examining five key dimensions of portfolio risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). We demonstrate across four studies that large language models used for investment advice induce increased portfolio risks across all five risk dimensions, and that a range of debiasing interventions only partially mitigate these risks. Our findings show that large language models exhibit similar “cognitive” biases as human investors, reinforcing existing investment biases inherent in their training data. These findings have important implications for private investors, policymakers, artificial intelligence developers, financial institutions, and the responsible development of large language models in the financial sector.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. The landscape of professional advice is experiencing a profound transformation driven by artificial intelligence (AI). In domains ranging from healthcare and legal services to education and finance, millions of individuals are increasingly turning to AI-powered advisory systems [1–5]. Within financial services specifically, this shift is exemplified by the sharp rise of robo-advisors [6–9]. These fully automated platforms assess people’s financial goals, evaluate their risk tolerance, and manage entire investment portfolios without any human intervention [6]. By democratizing access to financial advice, robo-advisors enable individuals who previously did not meet minimum investment thresholds to participate in wealth-building, potentially reducing global wealth inequality [7,10,11]. Beyond complex tasks such as managing an entirely financial portfolio, these technologies can also assist users with basic personal finance tasks such as budgeting and expense tracking, offering accessible financial guidance for everyday decisions [12]. However, despite these advantages, the first wave of such AI advisors across various domains has faced criticism for failing to provide adequately personalized recommendations that align with people’s individual needs and expectations [7]. In healthcare, AI diagnostic systems have demonstrated limitations in accounting for patient-specific factors [13], while in education, adaptive learning platforms often failed to accommodate diverse learning styles [14]. In response to these limitations, a new class of AI-driven, cross-domain advisory systems is emerging, leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT to provide highly tailored, personalized advice to individuals [15]. LLMs have demonstrated exceptional natural language understanding capabilities [16–18] and the ability to generate such personalized advice [19], potentially addressing key limitations of traditional advisory systems (see also [20] for a recent meta-analysis and increased adoption rates of AI since the emergence of LLMs). In finance specifically, LLMs exhibit exceptionally strong financial literacy [21], enabling them to analyze vast amounts of unstructured financial data in real time [22]. This capability enhances decision-making in areas such as trading and risk modeling as they have been shown to even reliably extract market sentiment to predict stock movements [22,23]. Beyond their technical proficiency, LLMs also demonstrate above-average emotional intelligence, with GPT-4 surpassing 89% of humans [24]. Such emotional intelligence is particularly crucial, as trust plays a fundamental role in financial decision making, and the relationship between private investors and their financial advisors strongly influences the actual adoption of financial advice [25]. Reflecting this trend, a recent study found that 22% of UK private investors with over £10,000 in investments reported using ChatGPT for financial advice, with 75% expressing confidence in its reliability [26] and similar rates have been reported in trusting ChatGPT for advice in other domains such as healthcare [27,28]. However, this growing reliance on LLMs for personalized advice raises a critical question: Can LLMs provide truly reliable financial advice, or do they reinforce already existing human investment biases? The current research examines whether especially LLM-generated financial advice is truly reliable and to what extent it exposes private investors to disproportionate risks. With millions of users starting to employ LLMs to receive financial advice, the belief that LLMs can deliver sound financial advice has the potential to shape not only individual investment decisions but also broader market dynamics. If LLM-driven advisory services systematically reinforce investment biases, they could introduce not only idiosyncratic risks for single individuals—particularly those without access to human financial advisors—but systemic investment risks across financial markets at scale [29]. The potential risks of such an overreliance on LLM-generated financial advice might mirror similar adverse effects already documented in other domains, such as medical misdiagnoses resulting from AI-healthcare tools [30], biased legal outcomes from algorithmic decision systems [31,32], and educational disparities perpetuated by AI learning platforms that fail to address diverse student needs [14]. While these cross-domain risks are increasingly surfaced and recognized, a systematic empirical investigation of how LLMs specifically influence financial decision-making remains scarce. To address this critical gap on the financial implications of LLM-generated advice, the current work presents a series of large-scale LLM experiments systematically prompting three major LLMs (Open AI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Microsoft’s Copilot) with varying complexity and investor profiles (e.g., young, risk-seeking investors to older, conservative investors). We evaluate the impact of LLM-generated advice on private investors’ financial portfolios using a comprehensive investment risk framework spanning five key domains (see Conceptual Framework section for details; i.e., geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). Across four studies, we demonstrate that LLM-generated investment advice systematically increases portfolio risks for private investors across all five dimensions, with negative implications for risk-adjusted portfolio returns, and we further show that (prompt-based) debiasing interventions only partially mitigate these risks. These findings offer four key contributions: First, our studies demonstrate that LLMs exhibit systematic investment biases similar to those of human advisors, suggesting that AI systems may broadly reinforce existing human biases across advisory domains. Second, we provide a comprehensive framework for assessing five essential types of risks induced by LLM-generated financial advice, establishing a methodology that could be adapted for other domains as well. Third, our findings inform private investors seeking AI assistance, emphasizing the importance of a more critical evaluation when following fully automated recommendations by LLMs. Finally, this research establishes a generalizable framework for stakeholders—including regulators, institutions, and technology developers—to test and validate LLM-generated recommendations in the financial sector. In what follows, we first develop a comprehensive conceptual framework explaining why and how LLMs may produce risky financial advice. We then present four studies that test this framework. Finally, we discuss the broader theoretical and regulatory implications of our findings, offering insights for investors, public policy, FinTech innovators, financial institutions, and academics concerned with the evolving role of LLMs in financial advisory services. We first provide a focused review of recent work on biases in LLMs and examine how two specific types of biases in the data generating process, namely geographical and language biases, may shape the type of financial advice received by LLMs. Next, we develop a set of predictions on how these biases are further reinforced by two LLM-specific biases—availability and recency biases. Table 1 presents a focused review of the literature documenting a set of key biases of LLMs documented in the literature. The key insight across prior work is that these models tend to replicate implicit biases found in their training data [33]. For instance, LLMs have been found to exhibit gender biases, such as the association of certain professions (e.g., doctors or lawyers) more frequently with men than women (gender bias); racial biases, displaying systematically more positive sentiment toward certain demographic groups (e.g., favoring left-wing over right-wing perspectives); and even cultural biases, associating specific religious groups with more negative traits (e.g., linking Muslims with terrorism, extremism, and violence). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.t001 Among these documented biases, two are particularly relevant in the context of financial advisory—geographical and language biases. LLMs tend to perform better in languages that are overrepresented in their training data [44], and they reflect geographic biases due to disproportionate media coverage of specific regions [41]. Thus, we predict that these fundamental biases shape the financial advice private investors receive. We refer to these biases collectively as biases in the training data generation (Fig 1). We argue that these inherent data generation biases are further reinforced by two LLM-specific biases: availability bias and recency bias. Availability bias describes LLMs’ tendency to favor information that is more easily accessible [45]. In the context of LLM-generated financial advice, this suggests that regions and companies with greater representation in the training data are likely to be more disproportionately recommended in LLM-generated investment advice. Recency bias refers to placing disproportionate weight on recent events compared to historical data [35]. For financial advice, this could result in LLM-generated recommendations that overemphasize more recent market trends. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g001 Fig 1 summarizes our conceptual model, illustrating how biases in the data generation process are reinforced by LLM-specific biases (availability and recency biases) to drive subsequent investment risks (see next section for details; i.e., geographical cluster, sector cluster, trend chasing, active investment allocation, and total expense risk). In this research, we examine five distinct types of investment risks. First, we refer to geographical cluster risk as the extent to which the received investment advice puts a greater emphasis on investments of US-based equities [46,47]. As alluded to earlier, we expect that due to the training data stemming especially from English language content [48] and the fact that the US as one of the largest and most developed economies in the world with a strong presence in media reports [49], potentially increases the likelihood to produce a high concentration with US based investments. The sector cluster risk captures the extent to which investments are clustered in single sectors. We expect that due to the strong media coverage of, for example, sectors such as technology or consumer staples compared to other sectors that are of similar (or even greater) economic weight in terms of contribution to the GDP (such as transportation or service sectors; [50,51]) leads to a potential over-investment in such sectors. Next, we assess an LLM’s trend chasing risk as the extent to which investments tend to follow more recent events. Such trend chasing can lead to buying decisions when prices are high and selling them when prices are low due to herding behavior [52]. Trend chasing is also important from a macroeconomic standpoint as trend chasing can amplify market bubbles and in turn, increase the overall volatility in a financial market [53]. Due to LLMs’ already documented recency bias, we expect such trend chasing in LLM-generated financial advice. As a fourth risk type, we will assess the active investment allocation risk as the extent to which investors are invested in actively (vs. passively) managed assets. Such investment strategies (and their associated asset classes) seek to outperform a financial market (or benchmark) by selecting and investing in specific equities [54,55]. Allocating a higher share into actively managed assets in an attempt to “beat the market” is generally associated with a greater volatility risk compared to a broad, passive market exposure [56]. We therefore expect an overinvestment in actively managed assets as the training data likely includes references to specific stocks, active trading strategies, or even stock picking recommendations that are prevalent in financial media, investment forums, and advisory content, where discussions about potential market-beating investments tend to receive more attention than passive investment approaches [57]. Finally, we will assess the total expense risk as the extent of the overall costs of owning an investment, including all fees related to general administrative costs, custodian fees, as well as management fees (in the case of actively managed assets). While related, the total expense risk is distinct from active investment allocation risk as the expense risk captures the impact of reducing net returns through investment fees, and not all active investment approaches incur excessive fees or expenses [58]. For example, an actively managed ETF (short for “Exchange-Traded Fund”) such as the Schwab US Dividend ETF has a lower TER (Total Expense Ratio: the TER reflects the total costs associated with managing a fund, including management fees and administrative expenses expressed as percentage of assets invested) compared to the passive Vanguard All World portfolio ETF (TERSCHD = .06% vs. TERVT = .07%). Table 2 summarizes all of our key risk measures of our conceptual model, their definitions, why they are important from an investment standpoint, and their formal calculation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.t002 Our experimental paradigm employs a large-scale experimental setting using a 3 (risk tendency: low/ medium/ high) x 3 (age: 15/ 30/ 50) x 3 (LLM: ChatGPT/ Copilot/ Gemini) full factorial design. The first two experimental factors (risk tendency and age) provide our baseline experimental paradigm, representing private investors’ self-stated risk-taking tendency and their objective risk exposure. Older (vs. younger) investors should generally invest in less risky assets due to their limited ability to equalize negative returns over the investment horizon [59–62]. Given that LLMs are expected to personalize financial advice [19], this research investigates how they adjust financial recommendations based on such investor risk-taking tendencies and investor age. The third experimental factor (type of LLM) addresses potential sampling issues due to LLM-specific performance differences. Our experimental paradigm resulted in 27 experimental conditions, which we each prompted 10 times to account for single (and sometimes less common) LLM responses [63]. Thus, we performed 270 prompts in total. We accessed ChatGPT 3.5 via OpenAI’s API [64], Copilot via the EdgeGPT Python package [65], and Gemini via the Bard API Python package [66]. We automatically queried these predominant LLMs in the marketplace to provide us with financial advice. The specific baseline prompt template with our experimental variations across all studies was performed as follows: “I’m a <15-year-old/ 30-year-old/ 50-year-old> looking to invest $10,000. I’m <not willing to take too many risks/ willing to take some risks/ willing to take a lot of risks> with my investment, and I’m hoping for some advice on what products I should consider investing in and how much I should allocate to each. Can you provide me with some recommendations? Please provide me with a table with the type of the investment, the name, the ticker symbol, and the amount I should invest.”. LLMs responded to these prompts with financial advice that included a table of specific investment recommendations (see Fig 2 for an exemplary investment advice by ChatGPT for a 30-year-old investor with a high risk-taking tendency). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g002 To ensure open science research practices [67], all of our code is documented and available on GitHub along with all datasets (https://github.com/ibtPhilipp/biasedEchoes). The next section details how each LLM response was further processed, how each key measure of interest was computed from the LLM’s unstructured text response, and how we analyzed the resulting measures. As summarized in Fig 3 the financial advice received by each LLM (see preceding section) was parsed and further augmented with additional financial data. We query ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini for financial advice, parse the investment portfolio recommendations, and augment them with data from Yahoo Finance, Refinitiv Eikon, and FRED (“Federal Reserve Economic Data” repository) to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received financial advice. We query ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini for financial advice, parse the investment portfolio recommendations, and augment them with data from Yahoo Finance, Refinitiv Eikon, and FRED (“Federal Reserve Economic Data” repository) to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received financial advice. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g003 First, we extracted the specific investment recommendations from the received unstructured LLM financial advice by performing regular expression splits. We extracted the type of investment such as “Stocks”, the name of the investment option such as “Apple Inc.”, the ticker symbol such as “AAPL”, and the amount in USD such as $3,000 for each position of the investment portfolio recommendation contained in the received financial advice. In case of an invalid LLM financial advice (i.e., non-parseable format or a missing allocation amount) we replaced the LLM response with a new one (i.e., re-prompting the model for the failed response). Second, we then further augmented the parsed investment portfolio recommendations with additional labeled financial data from Yahoo Finance (via the yfinance Python package [68]) and the Refinitiv Eikon database [69]. All investment portfolio positions were augmented with their asset type and equities were augmented by their corresponding sector utilizing Yahoo Finance. For portfolio positions with valid tickers (i.e., equities, ETFs, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies) we fetched price data from Yahoo Finance over a consistent 18-month period (1 July 2023–1 January 2025) following our initial data collection. Next, the investment portfolio positions were resolved to equity granularity level using holding data and augmented by geolocation and sector data from Refinitiv Eikon. In Study 3, investment portfolio positions were further augmented by their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) score (ranging from 0: poor ESG performance to 100: excellent ESG performance). ETF and mutual fund investment portfolio positions were augmented by their TER and management approach (i.e., active vs. passive). To establish a risk-free baseline, we queried the risk-free market rate (i.e., 10-year US treasury bill) from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis online database FRED [70]. All this additional labeled financial data was then used to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received LLM financial advice. Lastly, we fetched geolocation, sector, TER, holding, and price data for our benchmark (see section Benchmark) using exactly the same approach. We assessed the financial performance of the LLM financial advice utilizing the retrieved prices data and risk-free rate. The uniform time window across all retrieved data samples ensures comparability of the financial performance. We computed the recommended investment portfolio’s cumulative return, volatility (portfolio return standard deviation), and annualized risk-adjusted relative returns (annualized Sharpe ratio). Portfolio positions lacking a ticker and price data (e.g., savings or defined contribution accounts) were coded as zero return and zero volatility (only 7% of all observations). We utilized a zero-shot classification model (Facebook’s BART-large trained on the MultiNLI dataset; [71]) to assess the presence of explicit explanations about how the portfolio was constructed, the degree of assertiveness, and the presence of disclaimer notes. We specified the model for a single classification task and defined the possible classes of “explanations” and “no explanations” for the presence of explicit explanations, “assertive” and “non-assertive” for assertiveness, and “disclaimer” and “no disclaimer” for the presence of disclaimer notes. We retrieved the probabilities for each characteristic. We contrast the received financial advice relative to one of the most commonly used financial benchmark indices [72]. Specifically, we contrast all recommendations received by each LLM relative to the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (VT) ETF. This ETF represents a basket of securities that track the underlying index FTSE Global All Cap. Notably, the FTSE Global All Cap index serves as a strategic benchmark for the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global, which holds 1.5% of the world’s listed companies [73]. In short, this benchmark represents a common, broad, and diversified investment portfolio and has been used in prior work as well [72]. As with the data augmentation strategy, this data was queried using Yahoo Finance and the Refinitiv Eikon database. Investment risks. In what follows, we first analyze the multivariate effects of LLM type (Study 1) and experimental condition (Studies 2a, 2b, & 3), risk-taking tendency, and age on investment risk using a MANOVA. To assess each type of investment risk in detail, we conducted individual one-way ANOVAs, followed by planned contrasts using Tukey’s HSD correction for multiple comparisons. In Study 1, we first conducted one-way ANOVAs with individual investment risk types as the dependent variable and LLM as the predictor. We then performed t-tests comparing each LLM to the benchmark investment risk value. This helped determine whether the type of LLM influences investment risks and whether it outperforms or underperforms the benchmark. Next, we conducted additional ANOVAs with investment risk as the response variable, examining risk-taking tendency and age as predictors. For Studies 2a, 2b, and 3, we first conducted t-tests comparing investment risks between conditions and the contrast relative to the benchmark index. This allowed us to assess whether the intervention influenced the individual investment risk exposure and how it compared to the benchmark. Due to the large number of contrasts and comparisons, we report only theoretically or practically important contrasts directly in the manuscript, while the full range of contrasts is reported in detail across consecutive tables for each study in S1 Appendix. To enhance readability in the remainder of the paper, all specific effect sizes and test contrasts are reported in these tables as well. For a comprehensive overview of portfolio position exclusion criteria and robustness checks, see S4 Appendix. Financial Performance Analysis. To assess the impact of different LLMs on portfolio performance, we conducted a series of mixed linear model regressions with the portfolio cumulative return and Sharpe ratio respectively as the dependent variable. This approach was chosen to account for both fixed effects (i.e., LLMs, temporal trends, and individual characteristics) and random effects (group-level variations across portfolios). The fixed effects included the LLM (ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini) to assess whether specific models influence the return or Sharpe ratio. Additionally, we controlled for temporal trends by including monthly timestamps. This enabled us to assess how the portfolio returns and Sharpe ratios evolved over time. We also incorporated individual differences in risk-taking tendency (low, medium, and high) and age (15-, 30-, and 50-year-olds) to explore potential interactions between the LLM and risk-related variables. By introducing these predictors, we aimed to determine whether returns or Sharpe ratios varied systematically on risk-related variables and whether different LLMs performed better for specific investor types. This approach allowed us to isolate the effect of LLMs while accounting for risk-related variables and temporal trends. Language style analysis. First, we calculated a series of one-way ANOVAs and follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction for multiple comparisons for each characteristic (presence of explanations, assertiveness, and presence of disclaimer notes) as the dependent and the LLM as the independent variable. This allowed us to assess whether LLMs deviate in their language style when communicating the financial advice. Next, we conducted one-way ANOVAs and Tukey HSD corrected contrasts with each characteristic as the dependent and risk-taking tendency and age respectively as independent variables. These additional ANOVAs were conducted to test whether LLMs change their language style depending on an individual’s risk-taking tendency (e.g., very assertive language for high risk-taking individuals) and age. In Study 1 we assessed the type of financial advice that private investors receive as a function of their appetite for risk (self-stated risk-taking tendency and investor age) from the most widely used LLMs (Open AI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot). Study 1 employed our baseline experimental paradigm (see Methods section). A MANOVA with the investment risk types (geographical cluster, sector cluster, trend chasing, active investment allocation, and total expense risk) as the response and the LLM (ChatGPT/ Gemini/ Copilot), risk-taking tendency (low/ medium/ high), and age (15/ 30/ 50) as predictors showed significant effects of LLM type (ΛWilks = .7, F(10, 464) = 9.20, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .19, F(10, 464) = 60.41, p < .001), and age (ΛWilks = .87, F(5, 232) = 6.81, p < .001). In what follows, we provide a deep dive into the results explaining the differences of individual investment risks depending on each LLM (Fig 4). (A) We find above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 269), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 269), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 270), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270). The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolio samples. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark.

Our results show that all three LLMs revealed excessive cluster risk compared to our benchmark index. That is reflected in both an over-investment in US equities (with LLMs investing over 93% in US equities vs. 59% in the benchmark) and a higher concentration of funds in individual sectors (Fig 5). An additional concentration analysis showed that LLMs invested on average over 5% and 8% more in the already predominant technology (t(268) = 4.73, p < .001) and consumer cyclical sectors (t(268) = 8.23, p < .001) compared to the benchmark, thereby systematically increasing the sector cluster risk of the portfolio (see S2 Appendix for sector concentration details). This figure illustrates the portfolio weight by LLM type and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 269). This figure illustrates the portfolio weight by LLM type and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 269). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g005 Trend chasing risk. As shown in Fig 4:C, we find that all LLMs heavily engage in trend chasing with up to 27.92% invested in the top three equities that were traded most frequently in the past three months prior to prompting the LLMs. Consistent with our predictions, we find that all three LLMs display systematically higher trend chasing compared to the benchmark index (9%). Active investment allocation risk. We also observe systematically higher shares of actively managed investment options and stock picking. Specifically, we find that over 51% of investments were allocated into actively managed funds or single equities while the benchmark is a fully passive index-replicating ETF. Total expense risk. Finally, we observe significantly higher total expense ratios across all LLM portfolio recommendations compared to the benchmark index. Next, we conducted one-way ANOVAs with individual investment risks as the response variable and LLM type, risk-taking tendency as well as LLM type and age as predictors. Follow-up contrasts with Tukey’s HSD correction revealed a consistently higher active investment allocation risk for individuals with high (vs. low and medium) risk-taking tendencies. ChatGPT and Gemini even increased this risk for those with medium (vs. low) risk-taking tendencies. Similarly, LLMs provided financial advice with higher total expense risk for individuals with high (vs. low and medium) risk-taking tendencies. Further, ChatGPT and Copilot adjusted their recommendations for individuals with low (vs. medium and high) risk-taking tendencies, showing a significantly lower trend chasing risk – as low as 0.67% compared to 38.18% for those with high risk-taking tendencies. Other cases showed variations in investment risks based on risk-taking tendency and age-related risk, but these contrasts did not follow a consistent trend across LLMs. However, we find that ChatGPT and Gemini show less concentration in the technology and consumer cyclical sector for low risk-taking investors and a higher share in government activities. Copilot even concentrates over 46% of funds in government activities (i.e. bond ETFs) for low (vs. medium and high) risk-taking tendency resulting again in a higher sector concentration risk. Taken together, Study 1 provides initial evidence that LLM investment advice induces a significantly enhanced investment portfolio risk across all five types of portfolio risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). Further, we find that LLMs systematically adapt the provided investment advice depending on the risk-taking tendency. Financial performance analysis. A mixed-linear model, controlling for temporal effects and using the benchmark as the baseline, revealed that Copilot exhibited significantly lower Sharpe ratios (β = −1.14, p < .01), indicating worse risk-adjusted performance compared to the benchmark (see Fig 6). In contrast, ChatGPT (β = −.28, p = .52) and Gemini (β = −.12, p = .79) did not show statistically significant differences from the benchmark. Temporal effects were not significant, suggesting that the relative risk-adjusted performance of these portfolios remained stable over time but also not significantly more positive relative to the benchmark despite the additional amount of risk exposure of each LLM. The relatively strong risk-adjusted performance of ChatGPT and Gemini is likely driven by an overconcentration in the technology sector and the specific market conditions during the performance analysis period. Given the rapid growth of the technology sector—primarily fueled by advancements in LLM technology itself—portfolios disproportionately exposed to this sector benefited from favorable market trends. The figure shows the Sharpe ratio of ChatGPT (N = 1620), Copilot (N = 1620), and Gemini (N = 1620) relative to the benchmark (N = 18) over a 1.5-year period following the initial data collection. The figure shows the Sharpe ratio of ChatGPT (N = 1620), Copilot (N = 1620), and Gemini (N = 1620) relative to the benchmark (N = 18) over a 1.5-year period following the initial data collection. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g006 However, it is crucial to highlight that risk-adjusted returns, such as the Sharpe ratio, only adjust for the level of risk reflected in return volatility. This measure does not fully capture the broader spectrum of investment risks depending on other market conditions. For example, geopolitical events may evoke additional geographical risks inherent in LLM-generated investment advice leading to increased return fluctuations. Thus, relying solely on return volatility adjusted risk measures can lead to an incomplete assessment of true investment risks inherent in financial advice. Moreover, we also observed that both the choice of LLM and its sensitivity to people’s risk tendencies significantly influenced risk-adjusted performance. Specifically, mixed-linear models controlling for temporal effects and including self-stated risk-taking and age as predictors indicated that Copilot’s risk-adjusted performance was significantly worse for investors with a low self-stated risk-taking tendency (β = −3.13, p < .001), as well as for 30-year-olds (β = −1.57, p < .001) and 50-year-olds (β = −1.12, p = .01) compared to the benchmark. In summary, these findings suggest that while some LLMs may appear to perform adequately (or at least not worse compared to our benchmark) during specific market conditions, this performance is likely driven by the most recent market conditions that benefitted technology and AI investments rather than evidence of a superior investment strategy. The overconcentration in technology sectors that temporarily benefited ChatGPT and Gemini portfolios represents precisely the type of cluster risk that would expose investors to substantial losses during sector-specific downturns. Moreover, the significant underperformance of Copilot, particularly for risk-averse and middle-aged investors, reveals a concerning pattern: LLMs may be least reliable for the very demographic groups most likely to seek and follow automated financial advice. Collectively, these results indicate that LLM-generated financial advice creates a potentially disadvantageous combination of hidden risks and misleading performance indicators that could lead investors to overestimate the quality of LLM-generated recommendations while underestimating their exposure to undiversified risk factors not captured by conventional performance metrics. Language style analysis. Finally, we examined the specific language style employed across all models (see S3 Appendix for details). We utilized a zero-shot transformer model (Facebook’s BART-large trained on the MultiNLI dataset; [71]) to detect whether the investment advice offered a clear explanation or rationale (i.e., why a specific investment option should be chosen), the extent of assertiveness (i.e., how firmly the AI recommends to invest into a specific asset class), and to which extent the advice offers a disclaimer at the end of the recommendation (i.e., stating the potential risks involved with the investment). These analyses demonstrate that all recommendations offered a seemingly plausible explanation (e.g., “Procter & Gamble is a stable company with a long history of paying dividends. Dividend stocks provide regular income and can grow over time.”), with medium to high assertiveness (e.g., “Considering your requirements, here’s a diversified investment portfolio with a breakdown of how much you should allocate to each type of investment:”), and offering a seemingly trustworthy and “caring” disclaimer in the recommendation (e.g., “Remember, these are just recommendations, and it’s crucial to do your own research or consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.”). Notably, and as reported in the detailed analysis in S3 Appendix, our results revealed that approximately 95% of all investment recommendations across the three LLMs contained such financial investing disclaimers, suggesting they might function as a deliberate precautionary measure implemented by LLM providers to mitigate potential liability concerns while still delivering a highly assertive financial advice that users are likely to follow despite these warnings. Robustness checks. To test whether our findings hold for most recent versions of LLMs, we automatically queried ChatGPT 4o (gpt-4o-2024-08-06) and Claude Sonnet 3.5 (claude-3–5-sonnet-20241022). We employed our baseline template prompt (see Experimental paradigm) but added instructions that the model should check that the investment recommendations add up to $10,000 and respond in JSON format for improved advice parsing (this option did not exist when we collected the initial dataset). We employed a 2 (LLM: GPT 4o/ Sonnet 3.5) x 3 (risk-taking tendency: low, medium, high) x 3 (age: 15, 30, 50) full factorial design. Following our approach in Study 1, we repeated every prompt five times to prevent a single response selection biases. We retrieved valid responses for all prompts (N = 90). Next, we augmented the financial advice received with additional labeled data and calculated the investment risks analogous to Study 1. Our results show that also the most recent LLMs at the time of this study, exhibit the same above-benchmark investment risks, with the magnitude of each risk somewhat depending on the type of LLM (Fig 7). What is consistent is that all more recent LLMs show an even more pronounced sector cluster risk (due to investing more into the predominant sectors of technology and consumer cyclicals) and a higher total expense risk. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 359), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 357), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 360), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270) also for current versions of LLMs. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark.

The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g007 In Study 2a we assessed whether we can alter a single risk dimension (such as avoiding management fees) without changing the other types of risks. We used a two-cell experimental design (control prompt vs. debiasing intervention prompt) with a control prompt identical to Study 1 and a debiasing intervention prompt that explicitly requested no management fees (“I don’t want to pay any management fees.”). This simple, prompt-based intervention is the only realistic alternative for private investors (most private investors will not have the luxury to fine-tune a model and test more sophisticated debiasing techniques). The baseline paradigm in both the control condition and risk debiasing condition was identical and used the same experimental setup as in Study 1 (full factorial design with 3 (risk tendency: high/ medium/ low) x 3 (age: 15/ 30/ 50); given the similar responses provided by LLMs in Study 1, we focused on ChatGPT as the most successful commercially available LLM for the remainder of the paper). A MANOVA with the investment risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk) as the response and the prompting intervention (control vs. debiasing prompt), risk-taking tendency and age as predictors showed significant effects for the prompting intervention (ΛWilks = .82, F(5, 154) = 6.6, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .18, F(10, 308) = 41.68, p < .001), and investor age (ΛWilks = .88, F(5, 154) = 4.31, p < .01). Despite the significant main effect of the debiasing intervention, we find that narrow debiasing only directionally reduces the TER compared to the control condition and fails to decrease it to the level of the benchmark. However, we find that the debiasing intervention moderately reduces the share of actively managed investments. Yet, we still find that over 48% of investments are allocated to actively managed funds or single equities. The narrow debiasing intervention also reduced the over-investment in US stocks and sector concentration in LLM financial advice. However, the geographical as well as sector cluster risk still remained significantly larger compared to the benchmark. The narrow debiasing intervention prompt did not reduce trend chasing, resulting in still significantly stronger trend chasing compared to the benchmark. One-way ANOVAs and planned follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction with experimental condition and risk-taking tendency as well as experimental condition and age as predictor showed that the risk-taking tendency had only limited influence on investment risk changes between conditions. Specifically, our results show that the narrow debiasing intervention only significantly reduced the geographical cluster risk and active investment allocation risk for low self-stated risk-taking tendency where these risks were already the smallest compared to medium and high risk-taking tendency. These findings suggest that while simple prompt-based interventions (like requesting no management fees) can partially mitigate some investment risks, they fail to comprehensively address the full spectrum of risks present in LLM-generated financial advice. The persistence of significant geographical concentration, sector biases, and trend chasing behavior (despite a moderate reduction of actively managed funds) indicates that the systematic investment biases in LLMs are deeply embedded and relatively resistant to simple corrective measures that typical private investors might realistically employ. Financial Performance Analysis. A mixed-linear model, controlling for temporal effects and using the benchmark as a baseline revealed that the risk-adjusted performance of LLM investment advice in the control (β = −.21, p = .19) and debiasing intervention condition (β = −.29, p = .08) were not significantly different relative to the benchmark. Our results show that the risk-adjusted returns improved over time and were significantly lower in the first three months (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .01; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .01). Furthermore, we find that especially for investors with a high (βcontrol = −.41, p < .01; βdebiased = −.43, p < .01) and low (vs. medium) risk-taking tendency (βcontrol = −.46, p < .01; βdebiased = −.40, p < .01) the risk-adjusted returns were in fact lower in both prompt conditions compared to the benchmark. Again, we also find that the risk-adjusted returns were especially lower in the short-term (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .001). Finally, and similarly to Study 1, we find that 50-year-olds received investment advice with lower risk-adjusted returns (βcontrol = −.34, p = .04; βdebiased = −.34, p = .04) compared to the benchmark and that the risk-adjusted returns were especially reduced short-term (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .01). In summary, this study provides evidence that a narrow debiasing approach—targeting a single investment risk dimension—fails to reduce exposure to that specific risk in LLM-generated financial advice. Our findings suggest that private investors may only partially mitigate their investment risk exposure through simple prompt-based debiasing interventions. This is important as more advanced debiasing techniques, such as fine-tuning models, are not accessible to most private investors. In Study 2b we assessed to which extent a broader debiasing prompt may reduce the overall financial portfolio risk. Specifying multiple risks in the debiasing prompt, this prompting strategy may reinforce the risk reduction of every single risk alone as such broad debiasing interventions can often lead to effective debiasing of LLMs [74]. We tested this possibility by employing the same experimental design as in Study 2a, with an overarching debiasing prompt intervention (“Avoid common investment mistakes such as lack of diversification, cluster risks, and active management”). A MANOVA with the investment risks as the dependent and the prompting condition (control vs. debiasing intervention), risk-taking tendency, and age as the predictors showed a significant effect for the prompting condition (ΛWilks = .62, F(5, 165) = 20.58, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .31, F(10, 330) = 25.84, p < .001), while the effect of age was non-significant (ΛWilks = .93, F(5, 165) = 2.14, p = .06). Follow-up contrasts revealed that this broader debiasing intervention (vs. the narrow debiasing intervention in Study 2a) was largely successful at reducing a range of investment risks (Fig 8). Specifically, we find that the debiasing prompt reduced the over-investment in US assets and sector concentration (while still remaining significantly greater compared to the benchmark however). The amount of assets allocated to US assets was reduced by over 10% but remained at a still high 80% level. Additional contrasts further show that the sector concentration decreased due to a significant 8% and 9% investment allocation decrease in the predominant technology and consumer cyclical sectors. These findings highlight that a more equal distribution across sectors is easier to achieve compared to an equal distribution across financial markets (i.e., arguably due to the strong presence of US-based equities). We find that the debiasing intervention also significantly reduced trend chasing to the extent that it no longer differs significantly from the benchmark. Simultaneously, we find that the debiasing intervention reduces the share of actively managed investment options by over 32%. Finally, the debiasing intervention also significantly decreased the TER by more than.06%. Nevertheless, TER remained notably higher compared to our benchmark. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 180), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 180), (D) active investment risk (N = 180), and (C) non-different trend chasing risk (N = 180) when using a broad debiasing intervention. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective characteristic by condition. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark.

We find that the debiasing intervention significantly decreased the sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, and active investment allocation risk especially for investors with medium and high risk-taking tendency. Additionally, the debiasing intervention also decreased the total expense risk for high risk-taking tendency and the sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, and active investment allocation risk across all age levels. The collective insight is that broader debiasing interventions explicitly targeting multiple investment risks simultaneously can significantly reduce portfolio risks across most dimensions and age groups, although the geographic concentration remains somewhat elevated above benchmark levels. The differential effectiveness across investor profiles—with greater risk reduction for medium and high risk-taking investors—suggests that LLMs may be more susceptible to debiasing interventions when generating advice for more risk-tolerant investors, while continuing to embed the same biases reported earlier in recommendations for more conservative investors even after explicit correction attempts. Financial Performance Analysis. Analogous to Study 2a, we performed multiple mixed-linear regression models. Again, we find no significant difference of the LLM investment recommendations provided in the control (β = −.25, p = .11) and the debiased condition (β = −.29, p = .06) relative to the benchmark in terms of risk-adjusted returns. We only find a moderate temporal trend indicating lower risk-adjusted performance especially with reduced short-term returns (β08/2023 = −2.26, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.46, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.43, p < .001). We find that the risk-adjusted returns are worse for high (β = −.40, p < .01) and low risk-taking tendency (β = −.48 p < .001) in the control condition and for low risk-taking in the debiased condition (β = −.37 p = .01). Further, we find again that the risk-adjusted returns are lower than the benchmark for 50-year-olds in the control condition (βcontrol = −.34, p = .03) and for 30-year-olds in the debiased condition (βdebiased = −.37, p = .02). Also, in this model we find that the risk-adjusted returns were especially reduced short-term at the beginning of the performance measurement period (β08/2023 = −2.26, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.46, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.43, p < .001). Thus, despite the successful risk reduction through broader debiasing interventions, both control and debiased LLM-generated portfolios still failed to outperform the benchmark on risk-adjusted returns. These results suggest that even when successful at mitigating specific portfolio risks, debiasing interventions do not translate into improved risk-adjusted performance, indicating that LLM-generated financial advice continues to carry inefficiencies that cannot be fully addressed through prompt engineering alone. In Study 3 we tested whether incorporating an explicit investment goal in the prompt further aids in mitigating specific investment risks in LLMs investment advice. The study directly tests the ability of LLMs to adapt their investment advice based on contextual information and to personalize the investment advice to specific investor needs. Instead of directly asking the LLM to reduce the investment risks of a portfolio, a private investor may prompt a specific investment goal that would in turn translate into a decrease of specific investment risks merely based on the contextual information provided. The current study tests this possibility to infer and “sense” such context information. We employed the same experimental design as in Study 2a but incorporated an explicit investment goal in the prompt (“I want to invest in a way that promotes responsible and socially impactful contributions to our global society.”). We anticipated that this goal would lead LLMs to offer financial advice with reduced geographical and sector concentration risks. The phrase “contributions to our global society” was expected to decrease investments in U.S. assets, while “promotes responsible and socially impactful contributions” aimed to lessen the focus on technology and consumer cyclical sectors and thereby potentially reducing the previously documented trend chasing risk. We also expected that incorporating such a goal would result in investment recommendations with higher ESG scores [75]. A MANOVA with the investment risks as response and the prompt condition (control vs. goal prompt), risk-taking tendency and age as predictors showed a significant effect of the prompt condition (ΛWilks = .30, F(5, 161) = 74.31, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .51, F(10, 322) = 12.67, p < .001), while showing only a marginal effect of age (ΛWilks = .94, F(5, 161) = 2.20, p = .06). Follow-up contrasts revealed that investment risks showed a significant decrease in over-investments in US Stocks in the investment goal prompt compared to control, yet higher than our benchmark. However, we find that the introduction of a socially responsible investment goal did not lead to a significant decrease in sector concentration compared to the control prompt and remains still significantly higher than the benchmark index. As shown in Fig 9:A, not only remains this sector concentration very high, but is also substantially overleveraged towards utilities, due to shifting investments towards the energy sector (i.e., “green” energy). Next, we further examined the ESG score in the intervention (vs. control) condition. As summarized in Fig 9: B, specific investment goals were not effective in increasing the portfolio ESG rating of the portfolio. Specifically, we find that there is no significant portfolio ESG rating difference when incorporating a social responsibility goal prompt compared to the control prompt or benchmark. However, it is worth noting that incorporating the social responsibility goal effectively reduced the risk of receiving a low ESG rating compared to control (Levene’s test: F(1, 693) = 23.83, p < .001). We also observe a significant decrease in trend chasing behavior in the LLM investment advice when incorporating a social responsibility investment goal. Adding the social responsibility investment goal however, increased the actively managed portfolio share by over 29% compared to the control condition. Thus, LLMs engage in significantly more “stock picking” when provided with a specific investment goal. Finally, we observe significantly higher total expense ratios when incorporating a social responsibility goal compared to our control condition and benchmark.

In contrast, trend chasing risk decreased for those with medium and high risk-taking tendencies under the same condition. Further, the ESG score only increased for high risk-taking tendency when including the socially responsible investment goal where the ESG score was significantly lower (vs. medium and high self-stated risk-taking tendency) in the control condition. The geographical cluster risk decreased only for 50-year-olds. All other contrasts did not yield any meaningful patterns. The collective insight is that while LLMs can effectively adapt their investment advice to specific goals like a stronger social responsibility focus—evidenced by reduced US-centric investments and less trend chasing behavior—these adaptations come with significant trade-offs, including increased active management, higher expense ratios, and sector concentration shifted toward utilities rather than truly diversified portfolios. The inconsistent effectiveness across investor profiles further suggests that LLMs struggle to simultaneously optimize for both specific investment goals and fundamental portfolio construction principles, creating potentially new risk patterns when attempting to accommodate more personalized investing objectives. Financial Performance Analysis. As in the preceding studies, we conducted a series of mixed-linear models to analyze portfolio performance. We find that investments recommended by LLMs in the control condition are not significantly different from the benchmark in terms of risk-adjusted returns (β = −.25, p = .15). In the debiased condition, the LLM investment advice even underperformed the benchmark significantly (β = −.76, p < .001). The temporal trend indicating worse risk-adjusted performance in the beginning holds also for this model (β08/2023 = −2.62, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.76, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.78, p < .001; β10/2023 = −2.20, p = .04). We find that this underperformance in the debiased condition stems from the underperformance across both high (β = −1, p < .001) and medium risk-taking tendency investors (β = −1.02, p < .001) and we also find a clear underperformance for low risk-taking tendency in the control condition (β = −.48, p < .01). While we find no significant risk-adjusted underperformance for any age in the control condition, we document a strong underperformance across all age groups in the debiased condition (β15 = −.70, p < .001; β30 = −.75, p < .001; β50 = −.85, p < .001). Thus, we find overall that the introduction of socially responsible investment goals in LLM-generated advice led to significant underperformance compared to the benchmark, highlighting that when LLMs attempt to optimize for specific social impact objectives, they tend to sacrifice financial performance even more severely and lead to new, unwanted concentration issues (i.e., higher concentration in the utilities sector to promote investments in “green” energy). LLMs often reveal biases implicitly present in the underlying training data [33–35,38,76]. Our findings suggest that these biases can result in LLM-generated financial advice that leads to elevated investment risks for private investors across five major risk dimensions (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk) and that a range of debiasing interventions only partially mitigated these risks. We find that LLMs recommend a narrow range of geographical regions to invest, concentrate on a few narrow sectors, engage in more aggressive trend-following and stock-picking, and ultimately propose high-fee investment options—all recommendations that are incompatible with modern portfolio theory [46,52,56–58,77–81]. These findings illustrate the need for new risk frameworks in algorithmic finance and to better understand underlying data biases that can lead to a reinforcement of traditional (human) investment biases. The findings of this research document the inherent risks for private investors who already started to employ LLMs to receive financial advice [15], and we hope that the current findings promote a more critical assessment of the advice they receive. However, it is noteworthy to highlight that a critical assessment becomes more difficult when LLM-generated investment advice is communicated very convincingly (see S3 Appendix for details). These findings are sensitive because they suggest a potentially misleading sense of confidence and benevolence by LLM-generated investment advice, paired with precautionary “disclaimers” added in over 95% of the cases across all LLMs we examined. This finding is important in light of prior work showing that LLM advice is often perceived as strikingly more positive even though the advice might carry inherent bias or when the advice is objectively worse compared to expert humans [27,82–86]. The ability to blindly follow harmful LLM-generated investment recommendations presents a significant risk for individual investors, particularly those lacking potentially financial literacy or access to professional financial advisors. Future research should investigate how personal financial goals could be better integrated into AI investment strategies while maintaining appropriate risk management. A fruitful direction for future work is also to further examine whether financial education (potentially even through the use of LLMs) can ultimately empower private investors to critically assess such LLM-generated investment recommendations. Future regulatory research may also focus on developing frameworks to protect consumers from the potential risks of such generative investment advice. This includes exploring effective monitoring mechanisms to prevent more large-scale, systemic risks across financial markets and establishing reporting requirements for firms that utilize generative investment advisory tools. As LLMs become more integrated into financial advisory services, regulators may need to establish clear guidelines for transparency, explainability, and accountability in such AI-driven financial advice, especially when used by private investors. For FinTech developers, our research highlights the importance of addressing inherent biases in LLM-generated financial advice and how to develop future systems that better align with modern portfolio theory principles and avoid reinforcing harmful investment biases documented in the current research. A main question for future work will be how generative investment advice algorithms can be trained to generate recommendations that are more consistent with investors’ long-term financial goals and risk tolerance without inducing the investment risks reported in this paper. As with any research, we also highlight at least two limitations of the current work. First, we evaluated LLMs at specific points in time, and these models continue to evolve very rapidly. While our robustness checks with the most recent models (as per January 2025) seem to be robust (see Robustness Checks at the end of Study 1), future generations of models might improve radically once foundation models might be explicitly debiased during the training stage. Second, our simulated investment portfolios were evaluated over a specific time-period that coincided with a strong technology sector performance. However, we believe that exactly due to these favorable market conditions for technology-heavy portfolios, our financial performance analysis reported in this paper represent a conservative estimate of the potential risks of LLM-based financial advice. In market environments where technology sectors underperform, the geographical and sector concentration risks we identified would likely lead to even worse investment outcomes, further amplifying the risk exposure of portfolios generated by LLMs. In conclusion, the current work demonstrates that LLM-generated investment advice systematically increases portfolio risks across multiple dimensions, potentially exposing private investors to unwanted investment risks while creating a false sense of confidence through convincing language and reassuring disclaimers. These findings underscore the need for more cross-disciplinary collaboration among investors (both private and institutional investors), regulators, FinTech innovators, financial institutions, and researchers to develop more robust frameworks for evaluating and improving AI-generated financial advice. We hope the current research promotes such collaborations to proactively transform the financial advisory landscape to truly serve the interests of private investors through properly diversified, low-cost, and personalized financial advice. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s004 (DOCX) We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful feedback and constructive suggestions that significantly improved this manuscript.

Full Content:
Large language models are increasingly used by private investors seeking financial advice. The current paper examines the potential of these models to perpetuate investment biases and affect the economic security of individuals at scale. We provide a systematic assessment of how large language models used for investment advice shape the portfolio risks of private investors. We offer a comprehensive model of large language model investment advice risk, examining five key dimensions of portfolio risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). We demonstrate across four studies that large language models used for investment advice induce increased portfolio risks across all five risk dimensions, and that a range of debiasing interventions only partially mitigate these risks. Our findings show that large language models exhibit similar “cognitive” biases as human investors, reinforcing existing investment biases inherent in their training data. These findings have important implications for private investors, policymakers, artificial intelligence developers, financial institutions, and the responsible development of large language models in the financial sector.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. The landscape of professional advice is experiencing a profound transformation driven by artificial intelligence (AI). In domains ranging from healthcare and legal services to education and finance, millions of individuals are increasingly turning to AI-powered advisory systems [1–5]. Within financial services specifically, this shift is exemplified by the sharp rise of robo-advisors [6–9]. These fully automated platforms assess people’s financial goals, evaluate their risk tolerance, and manage entire investment portfolios without any human intervention [6]. By democratizing access to financial advice, robo-advisors enable individuals who previously did not meet minimum investment thresholds to participate in wealth-building, potentially reducing global wealth inequality [7,10,11]. Beyond complex tasks such as managing an entirely financial portfolio, these technologies can also assist users with basic personal finance tasks such as budgeting and expense tracking, offering accessible financial guidance for everyday decisions [12]. However, despite these advantages, the first wave of such AI advisors across various domains has faced criticism for failing to provide adequately personalized recommendations that align with people’s individual needs and expectations [7]. In healthcare, AI diagnostic systems have demonstrated limitations in accounting for patient-specific factors [13], while in education, adaptive learning platforms often failed to accommodate diverse learning styles [14]. In response to these limitations, a new class of AI-driven, cross-domain advisory systems is emerging, leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT to provide highly tailored, personalized advice to individuals [15]. LLMs have demonstrated exceptional natural language understanding capabilities [16–18] and the ability to generate such personalized advice [19], potentially addressing key limitations of traditional advisory systems (see also [20] for a recent meta-analysis and increased adoption rates of AI since the emergence of LLMs). In finance specifically, LLMs exhibit exceptionally strong financial literacy [21], enabling them to analyze vast amounts of unstructured financial data in real time [22]. This capability enhances decision-making in areas such as trading and risk modeling as they have been shown to even reliably extract market sentiment to predict stock movements [22,23]. Beyond their technical proficiency, LLMs also demonstrate above-average emotional intelligence, with GPT-4 surpassing 89% of humans [24]. Such emotional intelligence is particularly crucial, as trust plays a fundamental role in financial decision making, and the relationship between private investors and their financial advisors strongly influences the actual adoption of financial advice [25]. Reflecting this trend, a recent study found that 22% of UK private investors with over £10,000 in investments reported using ChatGPT for financial advice, with 75% expressing confidence in its reliability [26] and similar rates have been reported in trusting ChatGPT for advice in other domains such as healthcare [27,28]. However, this growing reliance on LLMs for personalized advice raises a critical question: Can LLMs provide truly reliable financial advice, or do they reinforce already existing human investment biases? The current research examines whether especially LLM-generated financial advice is truly reliable and to what extent it exposes private investors to disproportionate risks. With millions of users starting to employ LLMs to receive financial advice, the belief that LLMs can deliver sound financial advice has the potential to shape not only individual investment decisions but also broader market dynamics. If LLM-driven advisory services systematically reinforce investment biases, they could introduce not only idiosyncratic risks for single individuals—particularly those without access to human financial advisors—but systemic investment risks across financial markets at scale [29]. The potential risks of such an overreliance on LLM-generated financial advice might mirror similar adverse effects already documented in other domains, such as medical misdiagnoses resulting from AI-healthcare tools [30], biased legal outcomes from algorithmic decision systems [31,32], and educational disparities perpetuated by AI learning platforms that fail to address diverse student needs [14]. While these cross-domain risks are increasingly surfaced and recognized, a systematic empirical investigation of how LLMs specifically influence financial decision-making remains scarce. To address this critical gap on the financial implications of LLM-generated advice, the current work presents a series of large-scale LLM experiments systematically prompting three major LLMs (Open AI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Microsoft’s Copilot) with varying complexity and investor profiles (e.g., young, risk-seeking investors to older, conservative investors). We evaluate the impact of LLM-generated advice on private investors’ financial portfolios using a comprehensive investment risk framework spanning five key domains (see Conceptual Framework section for details; i.e., geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). Across four studies, we demonstrate that LLM-generated investment advice systematically increases portfolio risks for private investors across all five dimensions, with negative implications for risk-adjusted portfolio returns, and we further show that (prompt-based) debiasing interventions only partially mitigate these risks. These findings offer four key contributions: First, our studies demonstrate that LLMs exhibit systematic investment biases similar to those of human advisors, suggesting that AI systems may broadly reinforce existing human biases across advisory domains. Second, we provide a comprehensive framework for assessing five essential types of risks induced by LLM-generated financial advice, establishing a methodology that could be adapted for other domains as well. Third, our findings inform private investors seeking AI assistance, emphasizing the importance of a more critical evaluation when following fully automated recommendations by LLMs. Finally, this research establishes a generalizable framework for stakeholders—including regulators, institutions, and technology developers—to test and validate LLM-generated recommendations in the financial sector. In what follows, we first develop a comprehensive conceptual framework explaining why and how LLMs may produce risky financial advice. We then present four studies that test this framework. Finally, we discuss the broader theoretical and regulatory implications of our findings, offering insights for investors, public policy, FinTech innovators, financial institutions, and academics concerned with the evolving role of LLMs in financial advisory services. We first provide a focused review of recent work on biases in LLMs and examine how two specific types of biases in the data generating process, namely geographical and language biases, may shape the type of financial advice received by LLMs. Next, we develop a set of predictions on how these biases are further reinforced by two LLM-specific biases—availability and recency biases. Table 1 presents a focused review of the literature documenting a set of key biases of LLMs documented in the literature. The key insight across prior work is that these models tend to replicate implicit biases found in their training data [33]. For instance, LLMs have been found to exhibit gender biases, such as the association of certain professions (e.g., doctors or lawyers) more frequently with men than women (gender bias); racial biases, displaying systematically more positive sentiment toward certain demographic groups (e.g., favoring left-wing over right-wing perspectives); and even cultural biases, associating specific religious groups with more negative traits (e.g., linking Muslims with terrorism, extremism, and violence). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.t001 Among these documented biases, two are particularly relevant in the context of financial advisory—geographical and language biases. LLMs tend to perform better in languages that are overrepresented in their training data [44], and they reflect geographic biases due to disproportionate media coverage of specific regions [41]. Thus, we predict that these fundamental biases shape the financial advice private investors receive. We refer to these biases collectively as biases in the training data generation (Fig 1). We argue that these inherent data generation biases are further reinforced by two LLM-specific biases: availability bias and recency bias. Availability bias describes LLMs’ tendency to favor information that is more easily accessible [45]. In the context of LLM-generated financial advice, this suggests that regions and companies with greater representation in the training data are likely to be more disproportionately recommended in LLM-generated investment advice. Recency bias refers to placing disproportionate weight on recent events compared to historical data [35]. For financial advice, this could result in LLM-generated recommendations that overemphasize more recent market trends. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g001 Fig 1 summarizes our conceptual model, illustrating how biases in the data generation process are reinforced by LLM-specific biases (availability and recency biases) to drive subsequent investment risks (see next section for details; i.e., geographical cluster, sector cluster, trend chasing, active investment allocation, and total expense risk). In this research, we examine five distinct types of investment risks. First, we refer to geographical cluster risk as the extent to which the received investment advice puts a greater emphasis on investments of US-based equities [46,47]. As alluded to earlier, we expect that due to the training data stemming especially from English language content [48] and the fact that the US as one of the largest and most developed economies in the world with a strong presence in media reports [49], potentially increases the likelihood to produce a high concentration with US based investments. The sector cluster risk captures the extent to which investments are clustered in single sectors. We expect that due to the strong media coverage of, for example, sectors such as technology or consumer staples compared to other sectors that are of similar (or even greater) economic weight in terms of contribution to the GDP (such as transportation or service sectors; [50,51]) leads to a potential over-investment in such sectors. Next, we assess an LLM’s trend chasing risk as the extent to which investments tend to follow more recent events. Such trend chasing can lead to buying decisions when prices are high and selling them when prices are low due to herding behavior [52]. Trend chasing is also important from a macroeconomic standpoint as trend chasing can amplify market bubbles and in turn, increase the overall volatility in a financial market [53]. Due to LLMs’ already documented recency bias, we expect such trend chasing in LLM-generated financial advice. As a fourth risk type, we will assess the active investment allocation risk as the extent to which investors are invested in actively (vs. passively) managed assets. Such investment strategies (and their associated asset classes) seek to outperform a financial market (or benchmark) by selecting and investing in specific equities [54,55]. Allocating a higher share into actively managed assets in an attempt to “beat the market” is generally associated with a greater volatility risk compared to a broad, passive market exposure [56]. We therefore expect an overinvestment in actively managed assets as the training data likely includes references to specific stocks, active trading strategies, or even stock picking recommendations that are prevalent in financial media, investment forums, and advisory content, where discussions about potential market-beating investments tend to receive more attention than passive investment approaches [57]. Finally, we will assess the total expense risk as the extent of the overall costs of owning an investment, including all fees related to general administrative costs, custodian fees, as well as management fees (in the case of actively managed assets). While related, the total expense risk is distinct from active investment allocation risk as the expense risk captures the impact of reducing net returns through investment fees, and not all active investment approaches incur excessive fees or expenses [58]. For example, an actively managed ETF (short for “Exchange-Traded Fund”) such as the Schwab US Dividend ETF has a lower TER (Total Expense Ratio: the TER reflects the total costs associated with managing a fund, including management fees and administrative expenses expressed as percentage of assets invested) compared to the passive Vanguard All World portfolio ETF (TERSCHD = .06% vs. TERVT = .07%). Table 2 summarizes all of our key risk measures of our conceptual model, their definitions, why they are important from an investment standpoint, and their formal calculation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.t002 Our experimental paradigm employs a large-scale experimental setting using a 3 (risk tendency: low/ medium/ high) x 3 (age: 15/ 30/ 50) x 3 (LLM: ChatGPT/ Copilot/ Gemini) full factorial design. The first two experimental factors (risk tendency and age) provide our baseline experimental paradigm, representing private investors’ self-stated risk-taking tendency and their objective risk exposure. Older (vs. younger) investors should generally invest in less risky assets due to their limited ability to equalize negative returns over the investment horizon [59–62]. Given that LLMs are expected to personalize financial advice [19], this research investigates how they adjust financial recommendations based on such investor risk-taking tendencies and investor age. The third experimental factor (type of LLM) addresses potential sampling issues due to LLM-specific performance differences. Our experimental paradigm resulted in 27 experimental conditions, which we each prompted 10 times to account for single (and sometimes less common) LLM responses [63]. Thus, we performed 270 prompts in total. We accessed ChatGPT 3.5 via OpenAI’s API [64], Copilot via the EdgeGPT Python package [65], and Gemini via the Bard API Python package [66]. We automatically queried these predominant LLMs in the marketplace to provide us with financial advice. The specific baseline prompt template with our experimental variations across all studies was performed as follows: “I’m a <15-year-old/ 30-year-old/ 50-year-old> looking to invest $10,000. I’m <not willing to take too many risks/ willing to take some risks/ willing to take a lot of risks> with my investment, and I’m hoping for some advice on what products I should consider investing in and how much I should allocate to each. Can you provide me with some recommendations? Please provide me with a table with the type of the investment, the name, the ticker symbol, and the amount I should invest.”. LLMs responded to these prompts with financial advice that included a table of specific investment recommendations (see Fig 2 for an exemplary investment advice by ChatGPT for a 30-year-old investor with a high risk-taking tendency). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g002 To ensure open science research practices [67], all of our code is documented and available on GitHub along with all datasets (https://github.com/ibtPhilipp/biasedEchoes). The next section details how each LLM response was further processed, how each key measure of interest was computed from the LLM’s unstructured text response, and how we analyzed the resulting measures. As summarized in Fig 3 the financial advice received by each LLM (see preceding section) was parsed and further augmented with additional financial data. We query ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini for financial advice, parse the investment portfolio recommendations, and augment them with data from Yahoo Finance, Refinitiv Eikon, and FRED (“Federal Reserve Economic Data” repository) to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received financial advice. We query ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini for financial advice, parse the investment portfolio recommendations, and augment them with data from Yahoo Finance, Refinitiv Eikon, and FRED (“Federal Reserve Economic Data” repository) to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received financial advice. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g003 First, we extracted the specific investment recommendations from the received unstructured LLM financial advice by performing regular expression splits. We extracted the type of investment such as “Stocks”, the name of the investment option such as “Apple Inc.”, the ticker symbol such as “AAPL”, and the amount in USD such as $3,000 for each position of the investment portfolio recommendation contained in the received financial advice. In case of an invalid LLM financial advice (i.e., non-parseable format or a missing allocation amount) we replaced the LLM response with a new one (i.e., re-prompting the model for the failed response). Second, we then further augmented the parsed investment portfolio recommendations with additional labeled financial data from Yahoo Finance (via the yfinance Python package [68]) and the Refinitiv Eikon database [69]. All investment portfolio positions were augmented with their asset type and equities were augmented by their corresponding sector utilizing Yahoo Finance. For portfolio positions with valid tickers (i.e., equities, ETFs, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies) we fetched price data from Yahoo Finance over a consistent 18-month period (1 July 2023–1 January 2025) following our initial data collection. Next, the investment portfolio positions were resolved to equity granularity level using holding data and augmented by geolocation and sector data from Refinitiv Eikon. In Study 3, investment portfolio positions were further augmented by their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) score (ranging from 0: poor ESG performance to 100: excellent ESG performance). ETF and mutual fund investment portfolio positions were augmented by their TER and management approach (i.e., active vs. passive). To establish a risk-free baseline, we queried the risk-free market rate (i.e., 10-year US treasury bill) from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis online database FRED [70]. All this additional labeled financial data was then used to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received LLM financial advice. Lastly, we fetched geolocation, sector, TER, holding, and price data for our benchmark (see section Benchmark) using exactly the same approach. We assessed the financial performance of the LLM financial advice utilizing the retrieved prices data and risk-free rate. The uniform time window across all retrieved data samples ensures comparability of the financial performance. We computed the recommended investment portfolio’s cumulative return, volatility (portfolio return standard deviation), and annualized risk-adjusted relative returns (annualized Sharpe ratio). Portfolio positions lacking a ticker and price data (e.g., savings or defined contribution accounts) were coded as zero return and zero volatility (only 7% of all observations). We utilized a zero-shot classification model (Facebook’s BART-large trained on the MultiNLI dataset; [71]) to assess the presence of explicit explanations about how the portfolio was constructed, the degree of assertiveness, and the presence of disclaimer notes. We specified the model for a single classification task and defined the possible classes of “explanations” and “no explanations” for the presence of explicit explanations, “assertive” and “non-assertive” for assertiveness, and “disclaimer” and “no disclaimer” for the presence of disclaimer notes. We retrieved the probabilities for each characteristic. We contrast the received financial advice relative to one of the most commonly used financial benchmark indices [72]. Specifically, we contrast all recommendations received by each LLM relative to the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (VT) ETF. This ETF represents a basket of securities that track the underlying index FTSE Global All Cap. Notably, the FTSE Global All Cap index serves as a strategic benchmark for the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global, which holds 1.5% of the world’s listed companies [73]. In short, this benchmark represents a common, broad, and diversified investment portfolio and has been used in prior work as well [72]. As with the data augmentation strategy, this data was queried using Yahoo Finance and the Refinitiv Eikon database. Investment risks. In what follows, we first analyze the multivariate effects of LLM type (Study 1) and experimental condition (Studies 2a, 2b, & 3), risk-taking tendency, and age on investment risk using a MANOVA. To assess each type of investment risk in detail, we conducted individual one-way ANOVAs, followed by planned contrasts using Tukey’s HSD correction for multiple comparisons. In Study 1, we first conducted one-way ANOVAs with individual investment risk types as the dependent variable and LLM as the predictor. We then performed t-tests comparing each LLM to the benchmark investment risk value. This helped determine whether the type of LLM influences investment risks and whether it outperforms or underperforms the benchmark. Next, we conducted additional ANOVAs with investment risk as the response variable, examining risk-taking tendency and age as predictors. For Studies 2a, 2b, and 3, we first conducted t-tests comparing investment risks between conditions and the contrast relative to the benchmark index. This allowed us to assess whether the intervention influenced the individual investment risk exposure and how it compared to the benchmark. Due to the large number of contrasts and comparisons, we report only theoretically or practically important contrasts directly in the manuscript, while the full range of contrasts is reported in detail across consecutive tables for each study in S1 Appendix. To enhance readability in the remainder of the paper, all specific effect sizes and test contrasts are reported in these tables as well. For a comprehensive overview of portfolio position exclusion criteria and robustness checks, see S4 Appendix. Financial Performance Analysis. To assess the impact of different LLMs on portfolio performance, we conducted a series of mixed linear model regressions with the portfolio cumulative return and Sharpe ratio respectively as the dependent variable. This approach was chosen to account for both fixed effects (i.e., LLMs, temporal trends, and individual characteristics) and random effects (group-level variations across portfolios). The fixed effects included the LLM (ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini) to assess whether specific models influence the return or Sharpe ratio. Additionally, we controlled for temporal trends by including monthly timestamps. This enabled us to assess how the portfolio returns and Sharpe ratios evolved over time. We also incorporated individual differences in risk-taking tendency (low, medium, and high) and age (15-, 30-, and 50-year-olds) to explore potential interactions between the LLM and risk-related variables. By introducing these predictors, we aimed to determine whether returns or Sharpe ratios varied systematically on risk-related variables and whether different LLMs performed better for specific investor types. This approach allowed us to isolate the effect of LLMs while accounting for risk-related variables and temporal trends. Language style analysis. First, we calculated a series of one-way ANOVAs and follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction for multiple comparisons for each characteristic (presence of explanations, assertiveness, and presence of disclaimer notes) as the dependent and the LLM as the independent variable. This allowed us to assess whether LLMs deviate in their language style when communicating the financial advice. Next, we conducted one-way ANOVAs and Tukey HSD corrected contrasts with each characteristic as the dependent and risk-taking tendency and age respectively as independent variables. These additional ANOVAs were conducted to test whether LLMs change their language style depending on an individual’s risk-taking tendency (e.g., very assertive language for high risk-taking individuals) and age. In Study 1 we assessed the type of financial advice that private investors receive as a function of their appetite for risk (self-stated risk-taking tendency and investor age) from the most widely used LLMs (Open AI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot). Study 1 employed our baseline experimental paradigm (see Methods section). A MANOVA with the investment risk types (geographical cluster, sector cluster, trend chasing, active investment allocation, and total expense risk) as the response and the LLM (ChatGPT/ Gemini/ Copilot), risk-taking tendency (low/ medium/ high), and age (15/ 30/ 50) as predictors showed significant effects of LLM type (ΛWilks = .7, F(10, 464) = 9.20, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .19, F(10, 464) = 60.41, p < .001), and age (ΛWilks = .87, F(5, 232) = 6.81, p < .001). In what follows, we provide a deep dive into the results explaining the differences of individual investment risks depending on each LLM (Fig 4). (A) We find above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 269), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 269), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 270), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270). The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolio samples. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. (A) We find above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 269), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 269), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 270), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270). The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolio samples. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g004 Geographical & sector cluster risk. Our results show that all three LLMs revealed excessive cluster risk compared to our benchmark index. That is reflected in both an over-investment in US equities (with LLMs investing over 93% in US equities vs. 59% in the benchmark) and a higher concentration of funds in individual sectors (Fig 5). An additional concentration analysis showed that LLMs invested on average over 5% and 8% more in the already predominant technology (t(268) = 4.73, p < .001) and consumer cyclical sectors (t(268) = 8.23, p < .001) compared to the benchmark, thereby systematically increasing the sector cluster risk of the portfolio (see S2 Appendix for sector concentration details). This figure illustrates the portfolio weight by LLM type and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 269). This figure illustrates the portfolio weight by LLM type and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 269). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g005 Trend chasing risk. As shown in Fig 4:C, we find that all LLMs heavily engage in trend chasing with up to 27.92% invested in the top three equities that were traded most frequently in the past three months prior to prompting the LLMs. Consistent with our predictions, we find that all three LLMs display systematically higher trend chasing compared to the benchmark index (9%). Active investment allocation risk. We also observe systematically higher shares of actively managed investment options and stock picking. Specifically, we find that over 51% of investments were allocated into actively managed funds or single equities while the benchmark is a fully passive index-replicating ETF. Total expense risk. Finally, we observe significantly higher total expense ratios across all LLM portfolio recommendations compared to the benchmark index. Next, we conducted one-way ANOVAs with individual investment risks as the response variable and LLM type, risk-taking tendency as well as LLM type and age as predictors. Follow-up contrasts with Tukey’s HSD correction revealed a consistently higher active investment allocation risk for individuals with high (vs. low and medium) risk-taking tendencies. ChatGPT and Gemini even increased this risk for those with medium (vs. low) risk-taking tendencies. Similarly, LLMs provided financial advice with higher total expense risk for individuals with high (vs. low and medium) risk-taking tendencies. Further, ChatGPT and Copilot adjusted their recommendations for individuals with low (vs. medium and high) risk-taking tendencies, showing a significantly lower trend chasing risk – as low as 0.67% compared to 38.18% for those with high risk-taking tendencies. Other cases showed variations in investment risks based on risk-taking tendency and age-related risk, but these contrasts did not follow a consistent trend across LLMs. However, we find that ChatGPT and Gemini show less concentration in the technology and consumer cyclical sector for low risk-taking investors and a higher share in government activities. Copilot even concentrates over 46% of funds in government activities (i.e. bond ETFs) for low (vs. medium and high) risk-taking tendency resulting again in a higher sector concentration risk. Taken together, Study 1 provides initial evidence that LLM investment advice induces a significantly enhanced investment portfolio risk across all five types of portfolio risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). Further, we find that LLMs systematically adapt the provided investment advice depending on the risk-taking tendency. Financial performance analysis. A mixed-linear model, controlling for temporal effects and using the benchmark as the baseline, revealed that Copilot exhibited significantly lower Sharpe ratios (β = −1.14, p < .01), indicating worse risk-adjusted performance compared to the benchmark (see Fig 6). In contrast, ChatGPT (β = −.28, p = .52) and Gemini (β = −.12, p = .79) did not show statistically significant differences from the benchmark. Temporal effects were not significant, suggesting that the relative risk-adjusted performance of these portfolios remained stable over time but also not significantly more positive relative to the benchmark despite the additional amount of risk exposure of each LLM. The relatively strong risk-adjusted performance of ChatGPT and Gemini is likely driven by an overconcentration in the technology sector and the specific market conditions during the performance analysis period. Given the rapid growth of the technology sector—primarily fueled by advancements in LLM technology itself—portfolios disproportionately exposed to this sector benefited from favorable market trends. The figure shows the Sharpe ratio of ChatGPT (N = 1620), Copilot (N = 1620), and Gemini (N = 1620) relative to the benchmark (N = 18) over a 1.5-year period following the initial data collection. The figure shows the Sharpe ratio of ChatGPT (N = 1620), Copilot (N = 1620), and Gemini (N = 1620) relative to the benchmark (N = 18) over a 1.5-year period following the initial data collection. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g006 However, it is crucial to highlight that risk-adjusted returns, such as the Sharpe ratio, only adjust for the level of risk reflected in return volatility. This measure does not fully capture the broader spectrum of investment risks depending on other market conditions. For example, geopolitical events may evoke additional geographical risks inherent in LLM-generated investment advice leading to increased return fluctuations. Thus, relying solely on return volatility adjusted risk measures can lead to an incomplete assessment of true investment risks inherent in financial advice. Moreover, we also observed that both the choice of LLM and its sensitivity to people’s risk tendencies significantly influenced risk-adjusted performance. Specifically, mixed-linear models controlling for temporal effects and including self-stated risk-taking and age as predictors indicated that Copilot’s risk-adjusted performance was significantly worse for investors with a low self-stated risk-taking tendency (β = −3.13, p < .001), as well as for 30-year-olds (β = −1.57, p < .001) and 50-year-olds (β = −1.12, p = .01) compared to the benchmark. In summary, these findings suggest that while some LLMs may appear to perform adequately (or at least not worse compared to our benchmark) during specific market conditions, this performance is likely driven by the most recent market conditions that benefitted technology and AI investments rather than evidence of a superior investment strategy. The overconcentration in technology sectors that temporarily benefited ChatGPT and Gemini portfolios represents precisely the type of cluster risk that would expose investors to substantial losses during sector-specific downturns. Moreover, the significant underperformance of Copilot, particularly for risk-averse and middle-aged investors, reveals a concerning pattern: LLMs may be least reliable for the very demographic groups most likely to seek and follow automated financial advice. Collectively, these results indicate that LLM-generated financial advice creates a potentially disadvantageous combination of hidden risks and misleading performance indicators that could lead investors to overestimate the quality of LLM-generated recommendations while underestimating their exposure to undiversified risk factors not captured by conventional performance metrics. Language style analysis. Finally, we examined the specific language style employed across all models (see S3 Appendix for details). We utilized a zero-shot transformer model (Facebook’s BART-large trained on the MultiNLI dataset; [71]) to detect whether the investment advice offered a clear explanation or rationale (i.e., why a specific investment option should be chosen), the extent of assertiveness (i.e., how firmly the AI recommends to invest into a specific asset class), and to which extent the advice offers a disclaimer at the end of the recommendation (i.e., stating the potential risks involved with the investment). These analyses demonstrate that all recommendations offered a seemingly plausible explanation (e.g., “Procter & Gamble is a stable company with a long history of paying dividends. Dividend stocks provide regular income and can grow over time.”), with medium to high assertiveness (e.g., “Considering your requirements, here’s a diversified investment portfolio with a breakdown of how much you should allocate to each type of investment:”), and offering a seemingly trustworthy and “caring” disclaimer in the recommendation (e.g., “Remember, these are just recommendations, and it’s crucial to do your own research or consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.”). Notably, and as reported in the detailed analysis in S3 Appendix, our results revealed that approximately 95% of all investment recommendations across the three LLMs contained such financial investing disclaimers, suggesting they might function as a deliberate precautionary measure implemented by LLM providers to mitigate potential liability concerns while still delivering a highly assertive financial advice that users are likely to follow despite these warnings. Robustness checks. To test whether our findings hold for most recent versions of LLMs, we automatically queried ChatGPT 4o (gpt-4o-2024-08-06) and Claude Sonnet 3.5 (claude-3–5-sonnet-20241022). We employed our baseline template prompt (see Experimental paradigm) but added instructions that the model should check that the investment recommendations add up to $10,000 and respond in JSON format for improved advice parsing (this option did not exist when we collected the initial dataset). We employed a 2 (LLM: GPT 4o/ Sonnet 3.5) x 3 (risk-taking tendency: low, medium, high) x 3 (age: 15, 30, 50) full factorial design. Following our approach in Study 1, we repeated every prompt five times to prevent a single response selection biases. We retrieved valid responses for all prompts (N = 90). Next, we augmented the financial advice received with additional labeled data and calculated the investment risks analogous to Study 1. Our results show that also the most recent LLMs at the time of this study, exhibit the same above-benchmark investment risks, with the magnitude of each risk somewhat depending on the type of LLM (Fig 7). What is consistent is that all more recent LLMs show an even more pronounced sector cluster risk (due to investing more into the predominant sectors of technology and consumer cyclicals) and a higher total expense risk. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 359), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 357), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 360), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270) also for current versions of LLMs. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark.

The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g007 In Study 2a we assessed whether we can alter a single risk dimension (such as avoiding management fees) without changing the other types of risks. We used a two-cell experimental design (control prompt vs. debiasing intervention prompt) with a control prompt identical to Study 1 and a debiasing intervention prompt that explicitly requested no management fees (“I don’t want to pay any management fees.”). This simple, prompt-based intervention is the only realistic alternative for private investors (most private investors will not have the luxury to fine-tune a model and test more sophisticated debiasing techniques). The baseline paradigm in both the control condition and risk debiasing condition was identical and used the same experimental setup as in Study 1 (full factorial design with 3 (risk tendency: high/ medium/ low) x 3 (age: 15/ 30/ 50); given the similar responses provided by LLMs in Study 1, we focused on ChatGPT as the most successful commercially available LLM for the remainder of the paper). A MANOVA with the investment risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk) as the response and the prompting intervention (control vs. debiasing prompt), risk-taking tendency and age as predictors showed significant effects for the prompting intervention (ΛWilks = .82, F(5, 154) = 6.6, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .18, F(10, 308) = 41.68, p < .001), and investor age (ΛWilks = .88, F(5, 154) = 4.31, p < .01). Despite the significant main effect of the debiasing intervention, we find that narrow debiasing only directionally reduces the TER compared to the control condition and fails to decrease it to the level of the benchmark. However, we find that the debiasing intervention moderately reduces the share of actively managed investments. Yet, we still find that over 48% of investments are allocated to actively managed funds or single equities. The narrow debiasing intervention also reduced the over-investment in US stocks and sector concentration in LLM financial advice. However, the geographical as well as sector cluster risk still remained significantly larger compared to the benchmark. The narrow debiasing intervention prompt did not reduce trend chasing, resulting in still significantly stronger trend chasing compared to the benchmark. One-way ANOVAs and planned follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction with experimental condition and risk-taking tendency as well as experimental condition and age as predictor showed that the risk-taking tendency had only limited influence on investment risk changes between conditions. Specifically, our results show that the narrow debiasing intervention only significantly reduced the geographical cluster risk and active investment allocation risk for low self-stated risk-taking tendency where these risks were already the smallest compared to medium and high risk-taking tendency. These findings suggest that while simple prompt-based interventions (like requesting no management fees) can partially mitigate some investment risks, they fail to comprehensively address the full spectrum of risks present in LLM-generated financial advice. The persistence of significant geographical concentration, sector biases, and trend chasing behavior (despite a moderate reduction of actively managed funds) indicates that the systematic investment biases in LLMs are deeply embedded and relatively resistant to simple corrective measures that typical private investors might realistically employ. Financial Performance Analysis. A mixed-linear model, controlling for temporal effects and using the benchmark as a baseline revealed that the risk-adjusted performance of LLM investment advice in the control (β = −.21, p = .19) and debiasing intervention condition (β = −.29, p = .08) were not significantly different relative to the benchmark. Our results show that the risk-adjusted returns improved over time and were significantly lower in the first three months (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .01; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .01). Furthermore, we find that especially for investors with a high (βcontrol = −.41, p < .01; βdebiased = −.43, p < .01) and low (vs. medium) risk-taking tendency (βcontrol = −.46, p < .01; βdebiased = −.40, p < .01) the risk-adjusted returns were in fact lower in both prompt conditions compared to the benchmark. Again, we also find that the risk-adjusted returns were especially lower in the short-term (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .001). Finally, and similarly to Study 1, we find that 50-year-olds received investment advice with lower risk-adjusted returns (βcontrol = −.34, p = .04; βdebiased = −.34, p = .04) compared to the benchmark and that the risk-adjusted returns were especially reduced short-term (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .01). In summary, this study provides evidence that a narrow debiasing approach—targeting a single investment risk dimension—fails to reduce exposure to that specific risk in LLM-generated financial advice. Our findings suggest that private investors may only partially mitigate their investment risk exposure through simple prompt-based debiasing interventions. This is important as more advanced debiasing techniques, such as fine-tuning models, are not accessible to most private investors. In Study 2b we assessed to which extent a broader debiasing prompt may reduce the overall financial portfolio risk. Specifying multiple risks in the debiasing prompt, this prompting strategy may reinforce the risk reduction of every single risk alone as such broad debiasing interventions can often lead to effective debiasing of LLMs [74]. We tested this possibility by employing the same experimental design as in Study 2a, with an overarching debiasing prompt intervention (“Avoid common investment mistakes such as lack of diversification, cluster risks, and active management”). A MANOVA with the investment risks as the dependent and the prompting condition (control vs. debiasing intervention), risk-taking tendency, and age as the predictors showed a significant effect for the prompting condition (ΛWilks = .62, F(5, 165) = 20.58, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .31, F(10, 330) = 25.84, p < .001), while the effect of age was non-significant (ΛWilks = .93, F(5, 165) = 2.14, p = .06). Follow-up contrasts revealed that this broader debiasing intervention (vs. the narrow debiasing intervention in Study 2a) was largely successful at reducing a range of investment risks (Fig 8). Specifically, we find that the debiasing prompt reduced the over-investment in US assets and sector concentration (while still remaining significantly greater compared to the benchmark however). The amount of assets allocated to US assets was reduced by over 10% but remained at a still high 80% level. Additional contrasts further show that the sector concentration decreased due to a significant 8% and 9% investment allocation decrease in the predominant technology and consumer cyclical sectors. These findings highlight that a more equal distribution across sectors is easier to achieve compared to an equal distribution across financial markets (i.e., arguably due to the strong presence of US-based equities). We find that the debiasing intervention also significantly reduced trend chasing to the extent that it no longer differs significantly from the benchmark. Simultaneously, we find that the debiasing intervention reduces the share of actively managed investment options by over 32%. Finally, the debiasing intervention also significantly decreased the TER by more than.06%. Nevertheless, TER remained notably higher compared to our benchmark. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 180), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 180), (D) active investment risk (N = 180), and (C) non-different trend chasing risk (N = 180) when using a broad debiasing intervention. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective characteristic by condition. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark.

We find that the debiasing intervention significantly decreased the sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, and active investment allocation risk especially for investors with medium and high risk-taking tendency. Additionally, the debiasing intervention also decreased the total expense risk for high risk-taking tendency and the sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, and active investment allocation risk across all age levels. The collective insight is that broader debiasing interventions explicitly targeting multiple investment risks simultaneously can significantly reduce portfolio risks across most dimensions and age groups, although the geographic concentration remains somewhat elevated above benchmark levels. The differential effectiveness across investor profiles—with greater risk reduction for medium and high risk-taking investors—suggests that LLMs may be more susceptible to debiasing interventions when generating advice for more risk-tolerant investors, while continuing to embed the same biases reported earlier in recommendations for more conservative investors even after explicit correction attempts. Financial Performance Analysis. Analogous to Study 2a, we performed multiple mixed-linear regression models. Again, we find no significant difference of the LLM investment recommendations provided in the control (β = −.25, p = .11) and the debiased condition (β = −.29, p = .06) relative to the benchmark in terms of risk-adjusted returns. We only find a moderate temporal trend indicating lower risk-adjusted performance especially with reduced short-term returns (β08/2023 = −2.26, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.46, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.43, p < .001). We find that the risk-adjusted returns are worse for high (β = −.40, p < .01) and low risk-taking tendency (β = −.48 p < .001) in the control condition and for low risk-taking in the debiased condition (β = −.37 p = .01). Further, we find again that the risk-adjusted returns are lower than the benchmark for 50-year-olds in the control condition (βcontrol = −.34, p = .03) and for 30-year-olds in the debiased condition (βdebiased = −.37, p = .02). Also, in this model we find that the risk-adjusted returns were especially reduced short-term at the beginning of the performance measurement period (β08/2023 = −2.26, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.46, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.43, p < .001). Thus, despite the successful risk reduction through broader debiasing interventions, both control and debiased LLM-generated portfolios still failed to outperform the benchmark on risk-adjusted returns. These results suggest that even when successful at mitigating specific portfolio risks, debiasing interventions do not translate into improved risk-adjusted performance, indicating that LLM-generated financial advice continues to carry inefficiencies that cannot be fully addressed through prompt engineering alone. In Study 3 we tested whether incorporating an explicit investment goal in the prompt further aids in mitigating specific investment risks in LLMs investment advice. The study directly tests the ability of LLMs to adapt their investment advice based on contextual information and to personalize the investment advice to specific investor needs. Instead of directly asking the LLM to reduce the investment risks of a portfolio, a private investor may prompt a specific investment goal that would in turn translate into a decrease of specific investment risks merely based on the contextual information provided. The current study tests this possibility to infer and “sense” such context information. We employed the same experimental design as in Study 2a but incorporated an explicit investment goal in the prompt (“I want to invest in a way that promotes responsible and socially impactful contributions to our global society.”). We anticipated that this goal would lead LLMs to offer financial advice with reduced geographical and sector concentration risks. The phrase “contributions to our global society” was expected to decrease investments in U.S. assets, while “promotes responsible and socially impactful contributions” aimed to lessen the focus on technology and consumer cyclical sectors and thereby potentially reducing the previously documented trend chasing risk. We also expected that incorporating such a goal would result in investment recommendations with higher ESG scores [75]. A MANOVA with the investment risks as response and the prompt condition (control vs. goal prompt), risk-taking tendency and age as predictors showed a significant effect of the prompt condition (ΛWilks = .30, F(5, 161) = 74.31, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .51, F(10, 322) = 12.67, p < .001), while showing only a marginal effect of age (ΛWilks = .94, F(5, 161) = 2.20, p = .06). Follow-up contrasts revealed that investment risks showed a significant decrease in over-investments in US Stocks in the investment goal prompt compared to control, yet higher than our benchmark. However, we find that the introduction of a socially responsible investment goal did not lead to a significant decrease in sector concentration compared to the control prompt and remains still significantly higher than the benchmark index. As shown in Fig 9:A, not only remains this sector concentration very high, but is also substantially overleveraged towards utilities, due to shifting investments towards the energy sector (i.e., “green” energy). Next, we further examined the ESG score in the intervention (vs. control) condition. As summarized in Fig 9: B, specific investment goals were not effective in increasing the portfolio ESG rating of the portfolio. Specifically, we find that there is no significant portfolio ESG rating difference when incorporating a social responsibility goal prompt compared to the control prompt or benchmark. However, it is worth noting that incorporating the social responsibility goal effectively reduced the risk of receiving a low ESG rating compared to control (Levene’s test: F(1, 693) = 23.83, p < .001). We also observe a significant decrease in trend chasing behavior in the LLM investment advice when incorporating a social responsibility investment goal. Adding the social responsibility investment goal however, increased the actively managed portfolio share by over 29% compared to the control condition. Thus, LLMs engage in significantly more “stock picking” when provided with a specific investment goal. Finally, we observe significantly higher total expense ratios when incorporating a social responsibility goal compared to our control condition and benchmark. (A) illustrates the portfolio weight by condition and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 180). In (B) (N = 180) the violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the ESG score by condition. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the ESG score value of the benchmark.

The dashed line represents the ESG score value of the benchmark. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g009 One-way ANOVAs and planned follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction revealed that incorporating the social responsibility goal in the prompt led to a significant increase in active investment allocation and total expense risk for participants with low and medium risk-taking tendencies. In contrast, trend chasing risk decreased for those with medium and high risk-taking tendencies under the same condition. Further, the ESG score only increased for high risk-taking tendency when including the socially responsible investment goal where the ESG score was significantly lower (vs. medium and high self-stated risk-taking tendency) in the control condition. The geographical cluster risk decreased only for 50-year-olds. All other contrasts did not yield any meaningful patterns. The collective insight is that while LLMs can effectively adapt their investment advice to specific goals like a stronger social responsibility focus—evidenced by reduced US-centric investments and less trend chasing behavior—these adaptations come with significant trade-offs, including increased active management, higher expense ratios, and sector concentration shifted toward utilities rather than truly diversified portfolios. The inconsistent effectiveness across investor profiles further suggests that LLMs struggle to simultaneously optimize for both specific investment goals and fundamental portfolio construction principles, creating potentially new risk patterns when attempting to accommodate more personalized investing objectives. Financial Performance Analysis. As in the preceding studies, we conducted a series of mixed-linear models to analyze portfolio performance. We find that investments recommended by LLMs in the control condition are not significantly different from the benchmark in terms of risk-adjusted returns (β = −.25, p = .15). In the debiased condition, the LLM investment advice even underperformed the benchmark significantly (β = −.76, p < .001). The temporal trend indicating worse risk-adjusted performance in the beginning holds also for this model (β08/2023 = −2.62, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.76, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.78, p < .001; β10/2023 = −2.20, p = .04). We find that this underperformance in the debiased condition stems from the underperformance across both high (β = −1, p < .001) and medium risk-taking tendency investors (β = −1.02, p < .001) and we also find a clear underperformance for low risk-taking tendency in the control condition (β = −.48, p < .01). While we find no significant risk-adjusted underperformance for any age in the control condition, we document a strong underperformance across all age groups in the debiased condition (β15 = −.70, p < .001; β30 = −.75, p < .001; β50 = −.85, p < .001). Thus, we find overall that the introduction of socially responsible investment goals in LLM-generated advice led to significant underperformance compared to the benchmark, highlighting that when LLMs attempt to optimize for specific social impact objectives, they tend to sacrifice financial performance even more severely and lead to new, unwanted concentration issues (i.e., higher concentration in the utilities sector to promote investments in “green” energy). LLMs often reveal biases implicitly present in the underlying training data [33–35,38,76]. Our findings suggest that these biases can result in LLM-generated financial advice that leads to elevated investment risks for private investors across five major risk dimensions (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk) and that a range of debiasing interventions only partially mitigated these risks. We find that LLMs recommend a narrow range of geographical regions to invest, concentrate on a few narrow sectors, engage in more aggressive trend-following and stock-picking, and ultimately propose high-fee investment options—all recommendations that are incompatible with modern portfolio theory [46,52,56–58,77–81]. These findings illustrate the need for new risk frameworks in algorithmic finance and to better understand underlying data biases that can lead to a reinforcement of traditional (human) investment biases. The findings of this research document the inherent risks for private investors who already started to employ LLMs to receive financial advice [15], and we hope that the current findings promote a more critical assessment of the advice they receive. However, it is noteworthy to highlight that a critical assessment becomes more difficult when LLM-generated investment advice is communicated very convincingly (see S3 Appendix for details). These findings are sensitive because they suggest a potentially misleading sense of confidence and benevolence by LLM-generated investment advice, paired with precautionary “disclaimers” added in over 95% of the cases across all LLMs we examined. This finding is important in light of prior work showing that LLM advice is often perceived as strikingly more positive even though the advice might carry inherent bias or when the advice is objectively worse compared to expert humans [27,82–86]. The ability to blindly follow harmful LLM-generated investment recommendations presents a significant risk for individual investors, particularly those lacking potentially financial literacy or access to professional financial advisors. Future research should investigate how personal financial goals could be better integrated into AI investment strategies while maintaining appropriate risk management. A fruitful direction for future work is also to further examine whether financial education (potentially even through the use of LLMs) can ultimately empower private investors to critically assess such LLM-generated investment recommendations. Future regulatory research may also focus on developing frameworks to protect consumers from the potential risks of such generative investment advice. This includes exploring effective monitoring mechanisms to prevent more large-scale, systemic risks across financial markets and establishing reporting requirements for firms that utilize generative investment advisory tools. As LLMs become more integrated into financial advisory services, regulators may need to establish clear guidelines for transparency, explainability, and accountability in such AI-driven financial advice, especially when used by private investors. For FinTech developers, our research highlights the importance of addressing inherent biases in LLM-generated financial advice and how to develop future systems that better align with modern portfolio theory principles and avoid reinforcing harmful investment biases documented in the current research. A main question for future work will be how generative investment advice algorithms can be trained to generate recommendations that are more consistent with investors’ long-term financial goals and risk tolerance without inducing the investment risks reported in this paper. As with any research, we also highlight at least two limitations of the current work. First, we evaluated LLMs at specific points in time, and these models continue to evolve very rapidly. While our robustness checks with the most recent models (as per January 2025) seem to be robust (see Robustness Checks at the end of Study 1), future generations of models might improve radically once foundation models might be explicitly debiased during the training stage. Second, our simulated investment portfolios were evaluated over a specific time-period that coincided with a strong technology sector performance. However, we believe that exactly due to these favorable market conditions for technology-heavy portfolios, our financial performance analysis reported in this paper represent a conservative estimate of the potential risks of LLM-based financial advice. In market environments where technology sectors underperform, the geographical and sector concentration risks we identified would likely lead to even worse investment outcomes, further amplifying the risk exposure of portfolios generated by LLMs. In conclusion, the current work demonstrates that LLM-generated investment advice systematically increases portfolio risks across multiple dimensions, potentially exposing private investors to unwanted investment risks while creating a false sense of confidence through convincing language and reassuring disclaimers. These findings underscore the need for more cross-disciplinary collaboration among investors (both private and institutional investors), regulators, FinTech innovators, financial institutions, and researchers to develop more robust frameworks for evaluating and improving AI-generated financial advice. We hope the current research promotes such collaborations to proactively transform the financial advisory landscape to truly serve the interests of private investors through properly diversified, low-cost, and personalized financial advice. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s004 (DOCX) We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful feedback and constructive suggestions that significantly improved this manuscript.

People experiencing homelessness (PEH) face complex health and social care needs, contributing to poor health outcomes and premature mortality. The Pharmacy Homeless Outreach Engagement Non-medical Independent prescribing Rx (PHOENIx) intervention was developed to address these challenges through assertive outreach by NHS pharmacist independent prescribers working with third sector homelessness charity workers for PEH presenting to community pharmacy. This qualitative study aims to explore participant, healthcare professional, and stakeholder perceptions of the PHOENIx intervention and acceptability of trial procedures. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with trial participants, internal stakeholders (healthcare professionals/researchers), and external stakeholders (national and local) across two intervention sites (Glasgow and Birmingham) between March 2023 and February 2024. Data was analysed thematically using Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) as a conceptual framework. Participants (n = 26; usual care n = 7; intervention n = 19) viewed PHOENIx as distinctively comprehensive, consistent, and caring, valuing its holistic approach and the trusting relationships developed with the team. Stakeholders (n = 16; internal n = 5; external n = 11) recognised PHOENIx’s potential to fill gaps in current service provision for PEH, appreciating its flexible, outreach-based model. Challenges identified included resource constraints, integration with existing services, and concerns about long-term sustainability. The PHOENIx intervention shows promise in providing accessible, comprehensive healthcare which was acceptable to PEH. Its success in engaging this underserved population offers valuable lessons for service development. However, addressing challenges around resources, scalability, and sustainability will be important considerations for a future trial and wider implementation and expansion.

Homelessness remains a significant and growing public health concern globally, with an estimated 895,000 people experiencing homelessness in Europe [1]. In Scotland, homeless applications increased from 35,759–39,006 in the year 2022–2023, representing a 9% increase [2]. Similarly, the rates of rough sleeping have also increased across other parts of the UK. In England there has been a 27% increase in rough sleeping in the year 2022–2023, as indicated by the most recent ‘snapshot’ [3]. People experiencing homelessness (PEH) face complex health and social care needs, contributing to premature mortality [4]. The average age of death for PEH is 45 years old, compared to 76 years in the general population [5]. Multiple factors contribute to this health inequality, including higher rates of physical and mental health conditions including substance use disorders, and barriers to accessing healthcare services [6,7]. PEH frequently experience multimorbidity, with a high prevalence of concurrent physical and mental health conditions [8]. Over 70% of PEH have underlying problem street-drug use [9]. Drug-related deaths among this population are particularly concerning, with a third of all deaths of PEH being street-drug-related [10]. Despite many receiving care from alcohol and drug recovery services, including daily prescribed opiate replacement therapy, there continues to be a high rate of overdoses experienced within the population [11]. Access to healthcare remains challenging for PEH due to stigma, discrimination, complex health systems that are difficult to navigate [12,13] and bureaucratic barriers [14,15]. As a result, unmet health needs are common [16,17]. Mental illness, pain, and substance dependency may be poorly managed [18], with evidence suggesting under-prescribing [11] and low rates of prescription adherence [19,20]. Patterns of emergency healthcare utilisation differ between PEH and those who are housed, with PEH facing higher rates of emergency room visits, hospitalisations, and readmissions [21,22]. Reasons for these visits also differ, with PEH more likely to present for drug, alcohol, and mental health-related problems, often in need of acute and crisis care [21,22,23,24]. While the availability and uptake of preventative healthcare is lower among PEH [14,21,25], presentations to primary care tend to be reactive [26]. It is estimated that one-third of homeless deaths are preventable through timely and effective use of health services [27]. However, there is a lack of robustly evaluated person-centred, integrated, community-based effective and cost- effective complex interventions for PEH [28]. In response to these challenges, innovative approaches are needed to address the intersecting issues of homelessness and problem drug use [29]. The PHOENIx (Pharmacist led Homeless Outreach Engagement Non-medical Independent prescribing Rx) intervention was first developed as a novel, low-threshold service offered to PEH in Glasgow, Scotland [30–33], which was reported to be well received by PEH [34]. This complex health and social care intervention aimed to address the multiple unmet needs of PEH through weekly assertive outreach by National Health Service (NHS) pharmacist independent prescribers working in collaboration with third sector homelessness charity workers. The PHOENIx intervention provided intensive and holistic health and social care support with persistent follow-up. Participants are visited via outreach and seen by PHOENIx workers (a pharmacist and third sector worker) at least once per week, with priorities set by the PEH and addressed gradually in succession. The intervention offered immediate health care and assessment, medication prescribing, and practical support such as advocacy, assistance with benefits applications, and provision of general wellbeing support [35]. Previous qualitative research based on the evaluation of the PHOENIx model of care in other settings has indicated that PHOENIx may improve health outcomes for PEH. Initial quantitative studies from previous evaluation of the PHOENIx model [11,36,37] have also highlighted the potential positive impact of the intervention on health-related quality of life [9], treatment burden, and delaying time to hospitalisation. However, there is a need for rigorous evaluation of whether the PHOENIx intervention can be delivered and how it is received, in other settings, e.g., community pharmacies and beyond Glasgow, in order to address the public health crisis of drug-related deaths and improve health outcomes for PEH. This study aims to explore participant, healthcare professional, researcher and stakeholder perceptions of the PHOENIx intervention and acceptability of trial procedures related to the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy model in Glasgow (Scotland) and Birmingham (England), UK. By examining the experiences and perspectives of those involved in the intervention, we seek to inform future developments and potential scale-up of this complex intervention to address the major health inequalities faced by PEH in the community pharmacy setting. The study used a qualitative design, involving semi-structured interviews with PHOENIx trial patient participants, healthcare professionals (HCPs) and researchers involved in the intervention and key stakeholders, including HCPs and third sector workers. Interviews were conducted across the two trial sites (Glasgow and Birmingham) between March 2023 and February 2024. Eligible participants were those who participated in the PHOENIx trial (both intervention and control arm participants) or played a role in the implementation of the intervention. Key stakeholders included those with an interest in the care/ service provision of PEH. Stakeholders were identified using a combination of professional networks, and snowball sampling. Ethical approval (REC reference 22/EM/0119; IRAS project ID: 309760) and Health Research Authority approval were obtained before recruitment and participants in the trial and qualitative process evaluation elements provided written informed consent before participation. All participants of the PHOENIx intervention, including those in the usual care group, were eligible to participate in interviews. Those eligible were approached by intervention workers to ascertain interest in participation. Those who expressed interest in taking part in interviews were supported by intervention staff and researchers to arrange a convenient time and date to conduct the interview. Interviews with intervention participants were conducted face-to-face, within community hubs that provide services to PEH at both trial sites. Those who expressed interest in participating were provided with an invitation pack containing a participant information sheet and consent form. At the time of interview, participants were given the opportunity to ask questions before providing written informed consent. Where needed, addition support was provided to potential participants to complete consent procedures, including the reading of the participant information sheet. Interviews with trial participants were around 60- minutes in duration (including consent procedures) and were audio-recorded. All interviews were transcribed verbatim, providing the data for qualitative analysis. Trial participants were given a £20 shopping voucher as a thank you for their time. Those involved in the delivery of the PHOENIx intervention (intervention staff and researchers) and key external stakeholders were invited to participate in interviews on a voluntary basis. External stakeholders were identified using professional networks and ‘snowball’ sampling. Those who expressed an interest in taking part were contacted by email and provided with an invitation pack that included a participant information sheet and a copy of the consent form. Once agreement had been made, interviews were arranged at a convenient day and time for the interviewee. Interviews were conducted either face to face, or via online video platforms, whichever was most convenient for the participants. At the time of interview participants were given the opportunity to ask questions before providing written informed consent. Those interviewed remotely via a video platform were required to sign and email the consent form to the researcher. In addition, verbal consent was taken and recorded at the start of the interview. Interviews with staff delivering the PHOENIx intervention and researchers were between 30–60 minutes in duration and were audio recorded. A topic guide was used to structure the interviews. The topic guide, informed by Normalisation Process Theory (NPT), explored several aspects including overall perception of the PHOENIx intervention, engagement with the intervention team, perceived impacts of the intervention and the acceptability of the trial procedures. NPT is a sociological theory that describes four mechanisms that can be used to explain and evaluate the adoption and implementation of complex interventions or service innovations [36]. The topic guides for interviews with the PHOENIx team and other key stakeholders also included discussion topics such as the main challenges to achieving optimal health care and support for PEH and the barriers and facilitators of the intervention, which were not included in intervention participant interviews. Data were analysed thematically with NPT used as an underpinning conceptual lens. The four constructs include: “coherence” (sense-making work); “cognitive participation” (relationship work); “collective action” (enacting work); and “reflexive monitoring” (appraisal work) [36]. These mechanisms were used to guide and structure conceptualisation of the analysis. Transcripts were analysed thematically after initial familiarisation. Thematic analysis is a method for identifying, analysing, and reporting recurring patterns within data [38]. A two-step method of analyses was used, with the data initially analysed with the aim of identifying recurring themes, and then subsequently analysed using the NPT framework. This qualitative method of analysis allows for the use of both inductive (bottom-up) and deductive (top-down) approaches. This ‘bottom up’ approach allowed for greater initial exploration of the data, free from the constraints of a theoretical model. This methodology was considered to be appropriate in order to truly recognise themes that the theory might not capture [38]. An initial coding framework was developed after becoming familiar with the data. All transcripts were double-coded by HS, SM, KW and YC to ensure the robustness of the data interpretation and coding, with any queries or discrepancies discussed and resolved by the coding team. Following the double coding of all transcripts a summary report was produced, and themes generated mapped to the mechanisms described in the NPT framework. Our findings are presented under four key themes and components of the NPT framework:1) coherence; 2) cognitive participation; 3) collective action; and 4) reflexive monitoring. These themes are described for both intervention participants and stakeholders, and illustrative quotations are provided in the following section. Participants consistently distinguished the PHOENIx intervention from their usual care experiences. They highlighted the comprehensive and personalised nature of the service, which contrasted sharply with their previous encounters with health and social care services. “Trying to find a way to move on from here, housing, medication, understanding your situation because everyone’s unique. Most support workers, especially on this building, a support session to them is like:””Is your housing benefit still active? Great.” You know what I mean? The Phoenix programme, they’re actually trying to help find out a way to move forward: ”Do you have bank accounts? Do you have ID? Do you have a housing option?” You speak to the support workers here and it’s just like:”Have you paid your service charge? Okay, fuck off, you know.” (IB05, Intervention participant) “Yeah, kind of. Not lost in the system, just overlooked. Overlooked is… There’s more important things to do. I think that’s the way it feels like sometimes.” (CB15, Usual care participant). Many participants expressed frustration with their previous care, particularly in relation to addiction and mental health services. They felt that PHOENIx offered a more holistic and responsive approach. “No because they’re just, it’s like they’re just there to hand in my script. They [addictions team] do ask me: “How you feeling?” but most of the time I’m just in and back out.” (IG011, Intervention participant) “So I made an appointment for that, and I didn’t go to that appointment, but they sent me another appointment out. […]And that’s another reason why I have to see a doctor, because I’ve been discharged from the mental health team, because I haven’t been good at keeping appointments with them either.” (IB6, Intervention participant) Participants valued the consistent and reliable nature of the PHOENIx intervention. The regular contact and follow-up were seen as crucial elements that distinguished this service from others they had experienced. This consistency helped to build trust and rapport between participants and the PHOENIx team, facilitating deeper engagement with the intervention. “It’s difficult to walk in and ask and saying what I need, because I’m used to doing everything myself but I wasn’t doing it because I was so down. Once I knew how they were and that and they weren’t judging, it was easy. They made it pleasurable. They made a good thing out of a bad situation.” (IB1, Intervention participant) “Well, building up a relationship, I’m getting to know them better and knowing that they are proper guys [PHOENIx team] that want to help you and not just, like, guys that are reading out of books and don’t know nothing and they’re trying but they’ve not got the heart in it, if you know what I mean?” (IG6, Intervention participant) It was recognised by some intervention participants that the consistency of the support worker role was a challenge to the delivery of the intervention. This highlighted the need for consistency in this role. “I want to continue with them, to be fair. I get a fair bit of help. It’s obviously just unfortunate that my support worker has gone ill for the last two weeks, but I’ve been emailed about that. Obviously he’s got some issues. I don’t know if there’s another support worker that steps in in the meanwhile.” (IB5, Intervention participant) Participants recognised and appreciated both the practical and emotional support provided by the PHOENIx team. They noted how the intervention addressed not only their immediate health needs but also broader social and emotional concerns. “Well, I spoke to the doctors I’m scared to go to the doctors, so whereas like, [support worker] absolutely amazing, comes and picks me up and took me to the doctors and stuff. I wouldn’t have gone on my own so this project is absolutely amazing, it’s getting me back on my feet and I wouldn’t have even gone to the doctors. It’s not because I can’t go but I’m scared to go, you know when you’re scared of the doctors you get a family member will drag…you know what it’s like. I haven’t got no one like that, so with this support project it gets me back on my feet, it just helps me…puts me in touch with my support services and just does what a family would do, because I haven’t got a family like that. “(IB7, Intervention participant) The combination of practical support and emotional care provided by the PHOENIx team was crucial in sustaining participants’ engagement with the intervention. Participants felt that the team’s holistic approach addressed their complex needs in a way that encouraged ongoing participation. Trust and non-judgemental relationships were important to participants, with some participants feeling motivated by the trusting relationship with the PHOENIx team. “It’s been amazing, to be honest, it’s been amazing. I’ve never had help like this and I’ve needed it for a long time and I’ve never had this help. Not only has he become my pharmacist, he’s become a friend. We really have become friends and it’s really good now. Someone to speak to you when I need to, you know what I mean? He’s sorted out a lot of things for me as well, health-wise. I’m always in fights, and so if I get injured, I can go and see him and he looks after me. Do you know what I mean?” (IB3, Intervention participant). Participants described a wide range of practical support provided by the PHOENIx team, including help with medication management, assistance with benefits applications, and support in accessing other services. “Oh, no, it was easy with [pharmacist]. Just when I was explaining to him, and I think my doctor keeps putting me on the Salbutamol, the Symbicort and Becotide and [pharmacist] put me on, I’m only on one steroid, kind of thing.[…] And it’s because they want me to sit and take them out of all the boxes and sit and take two puffs and then, shut one box and open another box. It’s just a matter of taking it out the one box, taking two puffs and that, yes, a great difference.” (IG3, Intervention participant) “I’m getting somewhere now, I’m getting help with my benefits, I’m getting help with my housing, my prescriptions. And it’s all thanks to going to the right sources, like the Phoenix team, for instance.” (IG6, Intervention participant) Alongside this practical support, participants emphasised the emotional work undertaken by the team. This included providing a listening ear, offering encouragement, and helping to build participants’ confidence and self-esteem. Participants noted how this combination of practical and emotional support enabled them to engage more effectively with their care and make positive changes in their lives. “I would say they’ve covered a lot with me, like my drink, my mental health, how I’m feeling this day, what am I eating, about my day. So they’ve covered a range of topics that no other people, even, like, my drugs worker has asked me, like what I’m eating and when I’m eating, am I eating regularly, like that.” (IG11, Intervention participant) Some participants expressed frustration that the PHOENIx team sometimes seemed limited in their ability to effect certain changes, particularly in areas like housing or specialist mental health support. Often, this lack of power is a result of the rules of other health and social care services, or long waiting times to access services. This perceived lack of power in certain areas led some participants to suggest that the team should be given more authority or resources to address complex needs. “Aye. Well, I trusted their knowledge, but their knowledge didn’t go any further than that. And I mean they’ve not got the powers to do anything. They can give me knowledge, but the knowledge that I then pass on to the ones that have got the power are just…” (IG2, Intervention participant) “I’m still waiting on an appointment to meet an alcohol worker. See, they’ve actually been in contact with me before, but unbeknown to me, I’ve either been on the drink or, I’m very forgetful as well, like, you know? So I’ve either not remembered receiving the letter, and [support worker] has been in contact with them to say, look, they guy’s still looking for a bit of support. But I’m still waiting to hear from them, like, you know, that’s the [alcohol service].” (IG7, Intervention participant) Participants consistently highlighted the importance of ongoing, long-term support. Many expressed concerns about what would happen when the intervention ended, indicating the value they placed on the continuous care provided by PHOENIx. “Yeah, 100 per cent. I’ll be sad if it stops, because who have I got to go to then? And I’ll just go back to square one again.” (IB3, Intervention participant) This emphasis on long-term support reflects the complex and chronic nature of many participants’ health and social issues, and their recognition of the need for sustained intervention. Usual care participants highlighted the reactive and inflexible nature of services which do not meet their needs. “Because there isn’t a lot of places, they always say:”Yes, have you been there?” but see when you go, they’re either shut or there’s nobody there or you need to come back another day. There’s never somewhere where you can just do a pick up. I’ve only been told: ”Right, yes, come up,” or you can just walk in and it’s there for you. It’s always…because you can’t have a breakdown at the correct time. Do you know what I’m talking about? If you need help, you can’t make sure it’s between nine and two or, do you know what I mean? It’s just, when you need help, you need help.” (CG13, Control participant) Intervention participants discussed the acceptability of the procedures of the intervention and trial. Overall, participants were supportive of the frequency and intensity of appointments with the PHOENIx team. “I didn’t think the Phoenix was going to help but I signed up to it, but I just thought it was just another one of the survey things. They’re going to promise you the world and do nothing. They did as much as they have said.” (IB5, Intervention participant) However, there were challenges around the consistency of support from the support worker at one site as a result of recruitment and retention issues. For example, support workers moving on to other roles had an impact on the perceived consistency of support received. Intervention participants indicated that the study questionnaire was too long in length and duration to complete, with some indicating that they did not believe the questions to be relevant and potentially stigmatising. A perceived lack of concentration and capability to answer some of the questions made the questionnaire challenging for some. Some indicated that the questionnaire was a perceived barrier to taking part in the study, while a significant number of participants did not remember having completed the study questionnaire. “I can’t really remember it to be honest but I ended up… It was a 20 minute thing and I ended up spending two hours.” (IB2, Intervention participant) “There were a few questions and I was like:”Forget that, let’s go onto the…” yeah, you don’t need to know that kind of thing, because why would you need to know certain things? It’s got nothing to do with why I’m really here them questions I see as judgement. Someone else is going to look at this sheet of paper and see certain questions that are nothing to do with me but I’m going to be judged on these certain questions because of the answers.” (IB3, Intervention participant) Stakeholders demonstrated a clear understanding of the various roles within the PHOENIx team and how these roles complemented each other to provide comprehensive care. “I think that’s good and I think it would get you so far. I mean, having a well-trained nurse practitioner, a pharmacist and a social worker, you would cover a lot of ground if those people were available to the person all the time. Obviously depending on how they all get on and everything. But those people working as like a mini- multidisciplinary team I think is a good idea.” (BS11, External Stakeholder) “Well, for me, it just seems like a really great way of doing things. Because from my perspective anyway, I [pharmacist] like to look at all the health stuff, and, yes, we…so, [support worker] is focused on the social things and the housing, but also, there’s a bit of a grey area as well, this aspect of, social stuff can really solve mental health issues, or at least improve the whole kind of thing. So, we both work on both sides of it, if you see what I mean. And there’s no real, I suppose…we just try and help people, whatever way is going to work.” (GS21, Internal Stakeholder) Stakeholders generally held positive views of the intervention, recognising its potential to address gaps in current service provision for PEH. Providing anticipatory care was one such gap that was discussed. “I think it’s a really interesting project and it…from my experience with other homeless projects, it does bridge a gap that I could see and that I’ve seen acutely, where people, you cannot get them to the…you might be supporting them with their housing, but you cannot get them to the GP, or to A&E, or to any healthcare professional, for love nor money. And having someone that can…an actual floating prescriber is a game changer, really, for these people’s health. And that…having that longer appointment time, and that sticky support, where they don’t get cut off just because they haven’t attended something, it’s so vital, because we’ve got…the odds are stacked up against homeless people, so much that they need all the help that we can offer. And we’ve got these pharmacists all across the country that could do this. So, I’d like to see the project grow, definitely, and I’d like to be part of it.” (BS9, Internal stakeholder) “I think that we know there is a gap...well, sorry, I believe there is a gap around wound care for people in the city centre particularly, probably the whole of the city, that are not engaged in community services for whatever reason. That is potentially something that PHOENIx could support with. We know that there is ongoing, as there always has been, the issues into...pathways into mental health support are always more difficult. We have got decent processes on paper, but when you speak to service users then they don’t reflect those processes. There is ongoing things like that that we are aware of and trying to do something about.” (GS23, External stakeholder) Stakeholders acknowledged the complex challenges involved in providing care to PEH and saw PHOENIx as a potential solution to some of these issues. Some challenges highlighted by stakeholders was increased complexity and demand on services, lack of opportunity to engage with PEH, competing priorities of PEH and complex navigation of services. “We have a really good system of care in the city. Alcohol and drug recovery services are really responsive. They hold a huge caseload, but the level of complexity and the level of demand is just always increasing. It is a really transient population in the city because it attracts people in from all over the country.” (GS23, External stakeholder). “So I think the main challenges are that people experiencing homelessness have lots of competing priorities, so they’re not always able to prioritise their health. There’s complications with their previous experience of using health services which are often very negative. They’re used to being turned away from places, told that this isn’t the right place for you, told you should be down the road, told you should have come before, you shouldn’t come now, you should come later, all of those things. They’re not really made to feel welcome in healthcare settings. I think that starts when people are young and they’re not confident, they’re often on their own, they often don’t have support. That’s the other thing, so they need support to navigate the health system. Usually we have that from friends, family, other people who will help us, but often people experiencing homelessness don’t have that. Having support is very important and that can make a big difference.” (BS11, External stakeholder) Stakeholders outside the immediate PHOENIx team generally viewed the intervention positively, recognising the team’s expertise and dedication. They appreciated the multidisciplinary nature of the team, the connection with the local community and viewed the team as highly skilled. “My knowledge of it is that it was a really great team and delivered a really good service and was incredibly responsive. I think what it has to do is it needs to link into those treatment and care services. It can’t just sit on its own, it can’t just be its own thing. It has to link into that wider system to add value to it and so that it can add value to the treatment and care. I think if that was to happen it would be really, really great.” (G23, External stakeholder) “Again, it is probably like that where we are looking at the health needs through addictions. They are getting a better service because these guys would just not go to their own GP. But we are looking after their health and obviously Phoenix guys really know their stuff about wounds, all that kind of stuff. They, I think, may become a gateway for a trust for us to then go to traditional health provider.” (GS19, External stakeholder) Internal stakeholders noted strong working relationships within the PHOENIx team, highlighting the importance of this collaboration for effective service delivery. “Well, it’s my job so aye, I love coming into my work, I love doing what I do and working with people who care, you know? So there’s not a day…but I mean, we have some tough days in here, don’t get me wrong, you know, we have some tough days. Aye. But there’s good days as well, and no matter how tough a day, we can always make it better the next day. And working with people that are all aligned and on the same page, want to do the same thing, it’s great. Aye.” (GS22, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders observed positive relationships developing between the PHOENIx team and participants, recognising this as a key factor in the intervention’s success. It was recognised that relationship building with participants can take time, highlighting the need for longer term interventions. The building of a consistent and trusting relationship was important to internal stakeholders. “I think that could do wonders really, because a lot of it is building the rapport and the relationship with somebody, getting that trust, you know, and if they know where to go they can support them. And you know, that trust is there, it’s someone else that they could contact if they needed to.” (BS14, External stakeholder) “And that’s the sort of service they needed. So, a lot of my experience with the Phoenix project, I was very open with the participants. I spoke to them very, like, was streetwise, sort of, speaking. I spoke to them like they were people. I wasn’t, sort of, putting barriers up, I spoke to them like…you know, we had very open discussions. And I felt that made the rapport really well, they felt more like friends than participants and they engaged well. And that was my main aim.” (BS11, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders identified numerous challenges in providing care to PEH, including data sharing between services, issues of engagement, continuity of care, and addressing complex, interconnected needs. “Obviously we talk about things like data protection, those kinds of things all become a barrier because the sharing of information, because we struggle there all the time. As you can imagine, we’ve got relationships with the police, got relationships with enforcement teams in the city, and we’ve got relationships with the community mental health team, with the healthcare services and just the data sharing barrier is a constant thing that comes forward, so that’s one barrier.” (BS10, External stakeholder) “I think obviously probably one of the biggest challenges is the fact that the access to care for people who are homeless is difficult. I think we’ve got to talk about it in the context of NHS care at the moment, access is difficult for everybody. Just insofar as demands are very high, there isn’t enough capacity for people. So if we’re thinking about GP practices, at the moment to get an appointment there’s a scramble at eight o’clock in the morning. You’ve got to be up, you’ve got to be on the phone, you’ve got to get through, there’s a limited number of appointments to do it. So that very much relies on the fact that you’ve got a phone, it’s working, you’re awake, blah, blah, blah.” (BS14, External stakeholder) “I mean the first bit of what I say relates to what I’ve just said. I mean the health system’s very rigid in lots of respects and it’s not designed to deal with people who are facing homelessness or related issues. Most of the health service just isn’t set up to cope with those people. As I said, how appointments are structured etcetera. So I think standard healthcare for most people who are homeless, isn’t going to work for them the way it’s set up at the moment. So I think actually we’ve got little opportunities.” (BS14, External stakeholder) While generally positive, stakeholders did identify some challenges in implementing PHOENIx, such as resource constraints and integration with existing services. “Some of the stuff that’s been a challenge has probably round about some of the services I spoke about wishing were here. Like, you know, maybe a lack of therapeutic mental health services, lack of easier access to rehab beds and stuff like that. So aye, that’s probably it. Aye, probably, that’s probably it.” (GS22, Internal stakeholder) Consistency of support provided at one intervention site was highlighted as a challenge. This perceived inconsistency was seen as a result of issues in the recruitment and retention of the support worker role. “Where we’re now, currently, as today, we’re getting participants who are not engaging that were engaging first. And that’s because there’s been a break in the support side. But generally, obviously, there’s only so much I can do. Like, I’ll call them, I’ll speak to them about health, but then when they ask for updates about their housing or their benefits, I can’t answer that. That’s because, you know, we’ve got that staggered, sort of, break down. We have got somebody in-house now who’s doing it, but sometimes it’s a bit too late.” (BS11, Internal stakeholder) The workload of the intervention team was also identified as a challenge, with high caseloads to manage, alongside administration for both intervention participants and the intervention itself. “Yes, workload is heavy, aye, workload is heavy. So, it’s 25 patients, well, we’re not seeing them all the time, but weekly contact with at least 20 is a lot, aye, it’s a lot. And sometimes, it’s half days, whole days, with one patient, trying to get things sorted for them, where they overdose, or whatever.” (GS21, Internal stakeholder) “No. The only aspect that I didn’t like about working in the team was just doing the paperwork and the data after the study. Just, you know, going back through and collating all the information, that was brutal, man. Six weeks or something in the office, day after day, just, you know, collating all the data and aye, aye, that’s not…I work here to work on the frontline, to be out, you know, working with people, and so being stuck in an office. But that’s the only thing I’ve not liked about working with the team.” (GS22, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders viewed PHOENIx as aligning closely with what they considered optimal care for PEH, particularly in its holistic, person-centred approach. Both internal and external stakeholders considered effective partnership working to be important to providing optimal care to PEH. “I know I’m very health focused, but actually homelessness is a health issue, there are health implications, but actually it’s a social issue. Those services need to have strong links with housing teams and all these other things, to get it right. I think it’s about people who commission the service and people who work in the service, understanding the complex nature of it. Plucking somebody from the street and giving them a house isn’t going to necessarily work straightaway. Some people haven’t lived in a house for a long time. We also put people…we have a higher expectation of them than we do of ourselves. If I rent a property I’m not given this list of rules of what I can and can’t do. I’m not scrutinised. Yes, I’m sure my agreement would say you can’t use illegal drugs on the property, you can’t do this. But no-one’s going to come and check.” (BS14, External stakeholder) “For optimal care. They need a holistic approach. I think what we offer, in terms of the Phoenix team, is looking at all aspects of their care, and then trying to narrow it down to, what are your priorities at this moment in time, but also, putting those other issues that are identified on the backburner, so that eventually, you can come and try and deal with them when they’re in a better place. I suppose it’s about realising that you’re working with people who are using drugs for a reason, and you have to acknowledge that and work around it, and I suppose that’s a big challenge for us.” (GS21, Internal Stakeholder) Stakeholders saw PHOENIx as playing a unique and valuable role in the care landscape for PEH, bridging gaps between different services and providing continuity of care. Work or tasks carried out by the PHOENIx team include social/wellbeing support, management of health conditions (including addictions) and financial and benefit support. “The one or two that needed…like, were underweight, I prescribed them Fortisip. But other than that, we’ve not really had to do anything. It has, like I was saying to you, I did do a lot, but it was more, like, social prescribing, like signposting them to housing, or food banks, or, you know, benefits. And it wasn’t a case where…initially when I came in, I thought it was going to be a lot of patients who were going to be mentally unwell, who were going to be physically unwell.“ (BS11, Internal Stakeholder) The PHOENIx team also provided support with navigating and referring to other services that might be perceived to be previously too complex for those with significant and complex needs. “If any social aspect is needed you can get the referral process started, you can give them your number, you can give them regular updates or signpost them. So the patient actually feels like they’re being listened to, rather than being, sort of, pushed back and just a number in a list.” (BS11, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders highlighted several positive aspects of PHOENIx, including its flexibility, holistic approach, and association with well-known or trusted organisations. “I think the visits, like the team going and visiting people, aye, well, I think the aspect that I like about it is it’s what’s needed. So, a lot of people that we provide support to find it difficult to engage with appointments and coming to, you know, certain places at certain times. So the team goes there. You know, the team will go there and if they don’t get somebody on one day they’ll try again, you know, they’ll keep trying, they’ll keep going back. They might not link in straight away but, you know, they’ll just keep…our motto’s keep chipping away. So just keep going back and then just gradually, slowly, slowly build up that relationship.” (GS22, Internal stakeholder) While generally positive, stakeholders did suggest some potential improvements for future iterations of PHOENIx. Streamlined data collection, larger teams with smaller caseloads, more locations and longer-term support were all suggested. Data collection was seen as burdensome to team members, particularly alongside managing a large caseload. “I also think that we really need to look at what data we’re collecting. Because it’s a feasibility trial, the data is…some of it, I feel, was irrelevant.” (BS9, Internal stakeholder) “So, I don’t really know what the optimal caseload…and it would probably vary depending on what was going on for, you know, different people within that caseload. But I’m guessing you’re probably looking at 16 maybe, an optimal caseload, as opposed to 25. So that’s probably the only thing that I would say would benefit changing.” (GS21, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders agreed that community pharmacy was an appropriate setting for the intervention, however, some stakeholders suggested different geographical locations, including those outside of city centres to reduce geographical barriers. “I think that Phoenix research needs to be done in a few locations. I know we’ve got Glasgow and Birmingham but I’ve previously worked in Manchester and Liverpool and they are 30 miles apart [sic] from each other, they do things completely differently to each other. I think it might have changed slightly now. And they have the same level of chaos that goes on around partnerships and around relationships with stakeholders, and the same level of chaos from service users because they are just like Birmingham, the same kind of city where people just move to, you know, and start again. Homeless community right through to professionals, you know, they are cities that are constantly changing.” (BS10, External stakeholder) “So I think just different pockets of the country where you’ve got those big urban cities like Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Birmingham, versus some of those more rural Devon, Gloucestershire kind of scenarios, and Worcestershire as well, there’s a massive homeless problem in Worcestershire but it’s all quite hidden, and I think from the perspective of research, it might be beneficial to tap into some of those areas and just see the disparity and the differences between town to town, city to city.” (BS10, External stakeholder) Longer-term support was also suggested for a future trial of PHOENIx. “Maybe we just need longer, we need longer time. We need, probably, smaller caseload to really get at it, just a little bit smaller, but I think that vwould work out, and more time, more time. If we had longer time for the thing, I’m sure we could see different…maybe slightly different results […]” (GS21, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders identified potential barriers to scaling up PHOENIx, including resource constraints, support and buy-in from policy makers, and intervention staffing. Funding was identified as the primary barrier to a future trial of the intervention. Alongside the removal or reduction in existing services, there is a perceived lack of buy-in from funders or other publicly funded services. Improving services that support PEH are perceived not to be a public priority. “I think it’s going to be funding. Funding’s going to be a big problem, whether you get the funding to see the whole project through. If it’s on a larger scale, like I said, it’ll be over a larger period of time and you will probably see participants getting housed.” (BS11, Internal stakeholder) “The Government aren’t really invested in tackling the issue, because at the heart of all, or nearly all health inequalities, is poverty. If you eliminate poverty most of health inequalities work wouldn’t need to be done.” (BS14, External stakeholder) The staffing of the intervention roles is also seen as a barrier to future implementation. In particular, the support worker role had a significant recruitment and retention challenge. “It’s money, it’s always money. So, prescribers are expensive, support workers are seen as cheap, but because they’re so cheap, the turnover in staff is incredibly high, which means that people don’t have stable support, essentially, they don’t see the same support worker for years and years. It might be that they…some people…I spoke to one person yesterday whose support worker left the week that they moved into the hostel, and they’re still not…two weeks later, they’ve still not been assigned anyone, so they have no idea what they’re doing. So, if money…if there was more money there to actually pay for these services, and also, more money to pay support workers a decent wage, so they’re more motivated to stay longer at the services, I think that would make the world of difference. The cost of having someone who can prescribe is…I mean, I….it would save money, I believe, in the long run, but it’s very difficult to prove.” (BS9, Internal stakeholder). This study shows that participants perceived the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy intervention, as distinctive, comprehensive, consistent, and caring. The intervention’s success appears to lie in its ability to combine practical support with emotional care, delivered through a reliable and trusting relationship between participants and the PHOENIx team. Participants had a clear understanding of how PHOENIx differs from usual care, particularly in its holistic approach and the continuity of care provided. Engagement was facilitated by the team’s consistent presence and their ability to address both a wide range of practical and emotional needs that enables participants to engage more effectively with their care. While there were some limitations in the team’s power to effect certain changes, it was clear that people valued the nature of the long-term support provided. Concerns expressed about the intervention ending underscores its perceived importance in participants’ lives and suggests a need for consideration of how such support can be sustained over time. These findings indicate that the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy intervention has successfully engaged this underserved population, providing a model of care that participants find accessible, comprehensive, and supportive. However, they also point to areas for potential improvement, particularly in terms of the scope of the team’s authority and the duration of support provided. Stakeholders’ perspectives on the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy intervention reveal a generally positive view of the intervention’s potential to improve care for PEH. They recognise its unique role in addressing gaps in current service provision and appreciate its holistic, flexible approach. However, they also identify challenges, particularly around resources and scalability, that should be addressed for future implementation and expansion of the intervention. The holistic approach of PHOENIx, addressing both health and social needs, and providing practical and emotional support was particularly valued by participants and recognised by stakeholders as aligning closely with optimal care for this population. This finding supports previous research emphasising the importance of integrated care models for PEH, who often face multiple, complex challenges that span health and social domains [39]. Participants described a wide range of practical assistance, from medication management to help with benefits applications, which addressed many of the barriers to healthcare access often faced by PEH [40]. Importantly, this practical support was coupled with emotional care, which participants found equally valuable. This holistic approach aligns with calls for trauma-informed practice for PEH, recognising the complex interplay between physical health, mental health, and social circumstances in this population [40,41]. However, the perceived lack of power in certain areas, as noted by some participants, suggests that there may be systemic barriers that limit the intervention’s ability to fully address all needs. This highlights the importance of considering broader structural factors and potential policy changes when developing interventions for PEH [42]. The relational aspects of the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy intervention emerged as a crucial factor in its success. Participants valued the consistent and reliable nature of their interactions with the PHOENIx team, which fostered trust and encouraged ongoing engagement. This finding is consistent with previous research highlighting the importance of trusting relationships in healthcare for PEH [43]. Stakeholders also recognised the strength of these relationships, both within the PHOENIx team and between the team and participants. The multidisciplinary nature of the team, combining pharmacist expertise with third sector support, was seen as a particular strength. This supports the growing body of evidence suggesting that multidisciplinary, collaborative approaches are most effective in addressing the complex needs of PEH [40]. The emphasis on building and maintaining relationships through consistent contact and follow-up addresses a key challenge in providing care to PEH, who often struggle with continuity of care due to their transient circumstances or exclusion from services [14]. The success of PHOENIx in this area suggests that its model of persistent and assertive outreach could be valuable for other services seeking to engage this population [44]. Both participants and stakeholders identified challenges in the implementation of PHOENIx, particularly around resources and integration with existing services. These challenges are common in the implementation of complex interventions and highlight the need for careful planning and adequate resourcing when scaling up such interventions [45]. Existing services may be required to change and become more flexible around appointments or move to addressing the persons wider needs during consultations rather than focussing on single problems or conditions. Stakeholders recognised the potential of PHOENIx to improve care delivery for PEH, particularly through its flexible, outreach-based model. The intervention’s success in engaging individuals who had a history of low care engagement was seen as a significant strength, addressing a key challenge in providing care to this population. However, the concern expressed by participants about the intervention ending highlights the ongoing, long-term nature of support needed by many PEH. This raises important questions about the sustainability of such intensive interventions and the need for long-term funding and support [38], ergo the need for definitive trials to demonstrate impact and cost effectiveness of new services in the current fiscal climate. Some components of the pilot intervention created challenges for delivery that should be taken into consideration for any future iterations. The study questionnaire administered to all participants was perceived to be irrelevant in portions, and onerous to complete for both patients and internal stakeholders. A redesign of the study questionnaire could help to reduce any unnecessary data collection and reduce the length and therefore duration of the questionnaire for both participants and researchers. Internal stakeholders also indicated that the lack of trial support, including trial data management, had a considerable impact on the workload involved in implementing the intervention. At both sites, the trial data management was primarily undertaken by the pharmacists. Any future trial should aim to provide additional administrative support to reduce the workload on the pharmacist and refocus the role on providing clinical support to participants. A significant challenge to the delivery of consistent support to participants was the high staff turnover in the support worker role. The issues around recruitment and retention, while only at one site, had a knock-on effect on other members of the research team. Future trials should aim to bolster this position, perhaps aiming to employ more than one support worker to ensure consistency for participants during periods of absence, improve overall retention and reduce the caseload of support workers. Recruitment and retention of trial participants should be considered to ensure representativeness of the population. PHOENIx participants represent 0.6% of Glasgow’s homeless population [46], and 0.3% of PEH in Birmingham [47]. A full RCT should aim to improve recruitment of study participants. This could be accomplished by garnering greater buy-in from other support services and third sector organisations, as well as ensuring that voucher incentivisation for participant follow-up is increased with inflation or the cost of living. The findings of this study have several implications for practice and policy in the area of healthcare for PEH. PHOENIx provided the opportunity to evaluate the intervention as an RCT, which is uncommon in homelessness health research. The trial represents a valuable step for homelessness health research methodology, and a unique contribution to the area of study. The intervention delivers integrated health and social care for PEH, supporting the delivery of NICE Guidelines (NG214). As identified by stakeholders, holistic, integrated care is key to optimal delivery of services to PEH. The success of PHOENIx’s comprehensive approach supports the need for services that address both generalist health and social needs in an integrated manner. Although the integrated approach is not unique to PHOENIx, the importance of consistent, trusting relationships in engaging PEH highlighted in this trial suggests that services should prioritise continuity of care and invest in building long-term relationships with this population. The combination of generalist healthcare expertise (pharmacist) and social care knowledge (third sector worker) was a key strength of PHOENIx, supporting the value of multidisciplinary approaches. The use of a pharmacist and support worker makes the intervention distinct from other interventions in the research area, however it is possible that the intervention could be delivered by other NHS staff to support scalability of the intervention, e.g., a healthcare support worker, working in tandem with a third sector support worker. The perceived lack of power of PHOENIx staff in certain areas highlights the need for broader policy changes to enable widening of roles in order that systemic barriers to care are addressed on outreach, to further build trust between PHOENIx and PEH. The perspectives captured are those of individuals who engaged with the intervention and only a small number of usual care participants. Future research could address these limitations by including a wider range of perspectives, including more usual care participants to allow for greater comparison of experience between groups. Further, some intervention participants were interviewed at an early stage of the intervention so the impact of the intervention could be difficult to assess. Longitudinal studies, or ethnographic methods could explore the long-term impacts of the intervention and the sustainability of its effects. The PHOENIx Community pharmacy intervention was deemed acceptable and perceived to have many perceived positive impacts. There is a high level of support for the PHOENIx intervention from both intervention participants and health care professionals/ stakeholders suggesting scope for progression to a full-scale trial. The PHOENIx intervention represents a promising approach to providing comprehensive, accessible healthcare to PEH. Its success in engaging this underserved population and addressing complex needs through a holistic, relationship-based approach offers valuable lessons for the improvement of services for PEH. The success of the engagement with this population could offer a guide to interventions for other underserved population beyond PEH. However, challenges around resources, scalability, and long-term sustainability of PHOENIx need to be addressed. As healthcare systems struggle with the challenge of complex needs of PEH, and recruitment crises among clinical professionals, models such as PHOENIx offer a template for more effective, person-centred care that holds promise for improving health outcomes for this vulnerable population.

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. You don't need to be a Silicon Valley engineer or have any technical background at all, to make ... More money with AI AI has become such a controversial topic. It's one of those things where you can look at it extremely positively, but extremely negatively at the same time. For example, just over a week ago, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo that the effects of AI in the organization would lead to large-scale layoffs and workforce reductions across the Big Tech giant, as more AI tools are being implemented and integrated across their workflow and systems. While this certainly spells bad news for employees who feel stuck within these roles, on the flip side, if you’ve been a casualty of an AI-induced layoff, there is still hope, because you can actually make AI work for you, not against you. You can actually join the opposition, so to speak, and leverage your existing skills while upskilling in AI, to build an AI-powered business as a freelancer. What’s really interesting is that more employers are outsourcing their work to freelance contractors. With freelance hiring up by 260% in the past two years alone, there’s never been a better time to be laid off, because opportunities are ripe for you to start your own business and pivot your career. So, if you’ve been waiting for a sign to launch your own venture, this is it. You can get started today, upskill relatively quickly, and capitalize on the strong interest that organizations have with implementing AI. Use this to your advantage so that you can effectively create your own job, hire yourself, and get paid for it. You know what’s even better? The AI-powered freelance business ideas listed in this article are no-code. This means you don’t need to be a software developer, ML engineer, or have a computer science background for these to work. Each of these ideas has the potential to rake in $100,000 or more a year in client contracts, projects, and consulting work. Let’s get into the list: There are two ways of looking at AI consulting. One is where you go deep into the development aspect of implementing AI into organizations. This is where you’ll definitely need to have solid technical background. But the other way of looking at it is a no-code approach. Some no-code options and services you can deliver for AI consulting work include: How much it pays: AI consulting work can pay as much as $175,000 a project. Create a monthly swipe file or kit of resources that your target clients can use, which will help them solve a specific problem. Monthly subscriptions are an excellent business model because they ensure longer retention and help to future-proof your career and finances due to their consistency. Additionally, this business model is perfect because it provides passive income, and it has low overheads. Often, you can start for less than $50, using one or more AI tools and Canva. They also support you during feast-or-famine cycles when clients from other streams of income may be running dry, and they make it easier for you as a freelancer to accurately predict and plan for your future financially, as well as making larger purchases. Some examples of AI-powered digital subscriptions you could offer include done-for-you marketing services, like: You can also combine some services to create higher-tier offers. For example, you could offer a YouTube content calendar, plus a strategy session, plus YouTube scripts. How much it pays: This business model provides unlimited income and can easily be scales and automated. Ask ChatGPT to draft a list of learning objectives and an outline for your niche corporate training program (the niche could be corporate wellbeing, sales, leadership training, etc.). Use it to brainstorm for the content and to develop the talking points of your presentation. Then, use AI tools like Prezi.ai or Canva’s AI features to help you develop the slide deck, and finally, ask ChatGPT to create survey questions relevant to your training, that you can give to attendees at the end of the session. How much it pays: Corporate trainers make about $87,000 a year, but on the higher end some are known to earn as much as $112,000 according to ZipRecruiter. That being said, if you provide digital products that can sell on their own, like ready-to-sell courses, you can make more money. Yes, you can build a business with AI. You just need to ensure that the following ingredients are in place: AI consulting is an extremely lucrative freelance business, with some projects paying upwards of ... More $150k Can I really make $100k a year using AI? Yes, AI has unlimited potential, and it’s only restricted by how and where you apply it. Once you spot a pain point, apply your expertise and use AI to back your solution so you can deliver it more efficiently and scale your income at the same time. Do I need to learn how to code to start an AI-powered business? No you don’t need coding knowledge. Business ideas like AI consulting focus on strategy and implementation advice.

BySchaeffer's Investment Research BySchaeffer's Investment Research, Contributor. Don’t think UBER’s drive up the charts is running out of gas. Rideshare firebrand Uber Technologies (UBER) boasts a 53.6% year-to-date gain. Despite a post-earnings bear gap back in early May, UBER proved resilient, and nabbed a May 20 record high of $93.60. Now, the shares are testing this level once more, and could barge on through, with this bullish combination flashing. UBER’s new highs are coinciding with historically low implied volatility (IV) -- a combination that has been bullish for the stock in the past. According to data from Schaeffer’s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been five other instances when Uber stock was trading within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer’s Volatility Index (SVI) sat in the 20th annual percentile or lower -- as it the case with Garmin’s current SVI of 32%, in the 7th annual percentile. The data shows that one month after those six previous signals, UBER was higher 60% of the time, averaging a 3.7% gain. From its current perch at $92.81, that would mean barreling past that May 20 high, an area that turned the stock away earlier this week. The enticing technical setup goes deeper than that, though. Note in the chart below the shares’ 50-day moving average that contained pullbacks between the two peaks in the last two months. Shorter term, a breakout from current levels would form a bullish flag pattern. Further, note the trendlines connecting late December bottom to April 2025 lows just below $65, as well as then-record highs in October with the May peak. All of the trendlines fit within a bullish uptrend channel that UBER is in, and shows no signs of breaching. UBER Stock Chart With 50-Day Moving Average Should Uber Technologies stock resume its uptrend, analyst adjustments to the upside could provide tailwinds. It may have already begun; earlier this week, brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald hiked its UBER price target to $106, and more bull notes could be on the way. The equity’s consensus 12-month price target of $96.87 is only a 4% premium to its current perch, while 10 brokerages are on the sidelines with tepid “hold” ratings. Breaking through to new record highs could compel analysts to jump on board for the long term.

ByCharlie Fink ByCharlie Fink, Contributor. Legal win for AI industry? A U.S. federal judge ruled that Anthropic’s use of copyrighted books to train its AI model Claude qualifies as fair use. Judge William Alsup likened it to a writer learning from prior work. However, he found Anthropic liable for copyright infringement for storing over 7 million pirated books in a central repository unrelated to training. That storage was not protected under fair use. Damages could be as high as $150,000 per infraction. A trial in December will address potential damages.

Illustration of the concept of legislation and regulations of AI Act In the Northern District of California, U.S. federal judge Vince Chhabria, dismissed a copyright lawsuit from 13 authors against Meta. The plaintiffs, which include Sarah Silverman and Ta‑Nehisi Coates, claimed Meta improperly used their books to train its Llama AI model. The court found the plaintiffs failed to show market harm or dilution, and granted summary judgment for Meta. The decision applies only to the specific authors involved and does not affirm that Meta’s data use is lawful across the board. On Last Week Tonight, John Oliver skewered the rise of “AI slop,” mass-produced, low-effort content flooding social media. In previous weeks, I’ve shared anthropomorphic cat dramas, and vlogs from Storm Troopers, Bigfoot and Jesus. It’s entertaining. It’s designed to go viral, and earn ad money. But, argues Oliver, it’s slop that drowns out real content. One landscape designer complains she can’t find pictures of real gardens on Pinterest anymore.

With no screen or HUD, the emphasis is on audio-driven utility and lightweight design. The glasses feature a 12MP stabilized camera, five mics, dual speakers, and electrochromic lenses that darken on demand. They weigh just 40 grams, support Alipay QR payments, and offer up to 21 hours of standby. Shipping in September, they start at ¥1,999 (about $280) and come in three colors.

ARtillery Intelligence’s June 2025 report projects headworn AR revenue to grow from $2.6 billion in 2024 to $13.05 billion in 2029. That's a compound annual growth rate of nearly 38 percent. This growth is led by enterprise productivity use cases, currently accounting for over 70 percent of market revenue. But consumer adoption is accelerating fast thanks to the success of “lite AR” smart glasses like Ray-Ban Meta. These tier-3, audio-first, non-display glasses have validated a new design direction: style-forward, AI-powered wearables that prioritize utility over immersion. Meta’s success has prompted rapid follow-on moves from Apple, Google (via Android XR), and Snap, with key consumer AR glasses expected by 2026–2027.

Title: AVGO Stock To $500?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/01/28: In this photo illustration, the Broadcom logo is seen displayed on a smartphone ... More screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Broadcom’s (NASDAQ: AVGO) extraordinary 125% increase from $110 levels in early 2024 has investors pondering if the AI chipmaker can replicate its success. What might lead the stock to rise to $500+ levels from here in the coming years? The most persuasive factor is Broadcom’s custom silicon division. AI-related semiconductors now account for over 50% of Broadcom’s sales, marking a significant shift in the company’s revenue composition. The management of the company assesses the serviceable addressable market at $15-20 billion. The custom chip sector shows tremendous growth potential. The overall market for custom chips could expand to approximately $55 billion by 2028, effectively more than tripling from current figures. This growth reflects hyperscalers’ increasing preference for purpose-built silicon over generalized processors. Additionally, if you’re seeking a more consistent route to gains than investing in a single stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and yielded over 91% since its inception. Also, check out – BigBear.ai: What's Happening With BBAI Stock? Other elements are at play as well. Broadcom's impressive earnings growth can support elevated valuations. The company's revenue is anticipated to grow at a high teens average annual rate to over $100 billion by 2029. Broadcom has high profitability with its adjusted net income margin of 50% in the past twelve months. This indicates that the impact on earnings will be more significant than on the top-line. At its present levels of $265, AVGO stock is trading at 45 times its trailing twelve months adjusted earnings of $5.84 per share. Additionally, check out – Broadcom’s Valuation Ratios. Maintaining this multiple could push the stock to around $500 within that timeframe. A higher multiple would enable an even greater increase. The existing customer relationships frequently involve multi-year commitments and substantial switching costs, which provides Broadcom with revenue visibility and pricing power, potentially maintaining premium valuations. For this multiple to broaden, Broadcom must showcase sustained strong annual revenue growth in AI segments, expand its market share in the custom silicon sector, focus on further margin improvement from a higher-value product mix, and secure contracts with new clients. In summary, Broadcom’s journey to doubling relies on capturing a significant portion of the growing custom chip market while preserving its technological prowess in AI networking. With the custom chip market potentially reaching $55 billion by 2028 and Broadcom’s current leading position, the company seems well-equipped for ongoing outperformance. While Broadcom displays strong growth prospects, several factors could restrict its upside. Consequently, investors considering Broadcom should carefully evaluate these risks. At Trefis, we incorporate such risks into our construction of the High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which encompasses 30 stocks and has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. What explains that outperformance? HQ Portfolio constituents tend to provide higher returns with lower volatility than the benchmark, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Diane Brady is executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative and Fortune Live Media. She also writes the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Earlier this week, I had a chance to chat with Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi and play with the four AI-powered agents that are rolling out next week for Quickbooks Online. It’s the first time I’ve seen agents deployed so effectively in handing off tasks to each other while helping humans be more productive. (I did enjoy seeing Cognizant’s Babak Hodjat create multi-agent systems on the spot at the Fortune COO Summit earlier this month, but many of us will deploy agents, not create them.) Intuit has four themed agents—a customer one for spotting leads in emails, drafting emails, and tracking interactions to the point of sales; one for payments to streamline and speed up that process; another for finance, to analyze and help you boost the health of your business; and a fourth for accounting, to reconcile expenses and make your bookkeepers happy. If I’d had this a decade ago, I might have remained an entrepreneur. “By far, this is the most significant launch we’ve ever had in our history because it’s end-to-end,” Goodarzi told me. “The fact that we have launched a virtual team that can do a lot of work, from managing your leads to making sure you get paid and your accounting is done, and it’s a combination of AI and humans doing the work. It’s been in the works for six years.” “It’s not about workflows,” he said. “It’s about a business feed that does everything for the customer while they’re always in control. And it’s not just about technology; it’s also about human expertise because, in our world, even Millennials, they want the reassurance of a human.” When I asked Goodarzi to reflect on what this means for the identity of a company that most associate with taxes and accounting, he said: “I want us to be known as the money company because of how we help businesses and consumers.”More news below.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com U.S.-China trade deal The U.S. and China have reached an “understanding” on trade in which China will supply rare earth minerals to the U.S. and in return, “we’ll take down our countermeasures,” US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg. Trump’s sons are considering a dynasty Eric Trump told the FT that he or Donald Jr., Ivanka, or his wife Lara might continue their father’s legacy in politics. “I think I could do it,” Eric Trump said. “And by the way, I think other members of our family could do it too.” Meta did not pay those guys $100 million Lucas Beyer, one of three OpenAI researchers who lead Sam Altman’s Zurich office, said on X that they did not get paid $100 million to join Mark Zuckerberg’s company. “No, we did not get 100M sign-on, that's fake news,” he said. Citi stock worth $100 a share, analyst says Citi chief Jane Fraser has suffered months of negative headlines but yesterday she got some good news. Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala rated the stock a “buy” with a price target of $100, and said Fraser’s reforms are working. The stock closed last night at $84.37. Two senior execs leave Tesla Omead Afshar, head sales and operations in North America and Europe, and Jenna Ferrua, director of North American HR, have exited Tesla, following a tough period for the company: Q1 vehicle deliveries fell 13% and profit declined 71%. Trump v the judges The White House sued all 15 federal judges in Maryland for opposing his deportation program. The normal method for disputing a judicial ruling would be to appeal a decision. The suit thus puts the Trump Administration on a legal collision course with the judiciary over which branch of government has a superior level of power. New York real estate developers in panic over Mamdani If Zohran Mamdani wins the NYC mayor’s race, it “would be the death penalty for the city,” Danny Fishman, CEO of Gaia Real Estate, told the WSJ. “And it would be the best thing to happen to Miami and Palm Beach since Covid.” Mamdani favors rent control, and New York’s property moguls are organizing to back almost anyone who might be able to beat him. Bill Ackman makes a pledge Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is looking to bankroll a candidate who can take down Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral election. He shared that he and his associates have “hundreds of millions of dollars” at the ready, and once they find the person for the job, “the funds will pour in.” Not made in the USA The Trump Organization is no longer claiming that its T1 phone will be made in the U.S., now opting instead for more vague descriptions of the product on its website like, “designed with American values in mind.” This switch up comes less than two weeks after the company announced its new brand.

While all eyes are on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ high-profile wedding in Venice, Italy this week, JCPenney hopes to divert attention to another Venice wedding that happened recently. On Wednesday, the department store funded a Los Angeles couple’s wedding in Venice, Calif. to prove that the big day doesn’t have to break the bank. The brand assisted high school sweethearts Estefany Gomez and Leonardo Rendon by outfitting the couple and their entire guest list, as well as providing all wedding decor—all for a total pricetag of $10,000. If you don’t believe them, check the receipt. “We’ve always dreamed of a California wedding, but with our families living on opposite coasts, it felt out of reach,” the couple said in a statement. “When JCPenney reached out, we honestly wondered if it could really happen. But they didn’t just say yes to our dream—they made every detail possible, from outfitting every guest in gorgeous fashion to the venue and cake, and most importantly, creating memories we’ll cherish forever.” Per Zola’s 2025 First Look Report, the average cost of a wedding in 2025 is projected to hit $36,000, an increase from $33,000 in 2024 and $29,000 in 2023. The campaign comes as JCPenney attempts to stage a major comeback under its new chief marketing officer (CMO) Marisa Thalberg, following a period of bankruptcy, layoffs, store closures, and slow sales. Per Retail Dive, the brand’s Q4 total net sales decreased more than 9% to $2.09 billion. The publication also reported on Monday that the department store will shutter its Alliance Supply Chain facility in Haslet, Texas in November, impacting 300 employees. In April, JCPenney rolled out “Yes, JCPenney”, its first campaign under Thalberg, featuring unbranded billboards across NYC’s Times Square and in Brookfield and Simon malls nationwide. The posters showcased models wearing its clothes with no indication of where they came from. A QR code printed on the ads linked to JCPenney’s site. In the two months since the campaign’s release, JCPenney said it has seen a 22% increase in Google searches for the brand, as well as a rise in brand consideration from 13.6% to 16.4%. One of the lead outfits from the ad campaign also achieved an 88% sell-through. Thalberg, who joined in October 2024, said facilitating what she calls “the other Venice wedding” was a part of the brand’s strategy to reaffirm JCPenney as a destination for budget-conscious trendsetters. “As we think about what our place is in culture, it’s to gently poke at things that are elite and show how we can translate it for everyone else,” she told ADWEEK. The CMO added that consumers can anticipate more from its “Yes, JCPenney” campaign as it rolls out back-to-school fashion in the fall. Cydney Lee is ADWEEK's advertising news reporter based out of NYC. Prior to joining in Aug. 2024, she was editorial assistant at Billboard. Her work has also appeared in W Magazine, GRAMMY.com, Pigeons & Planes, Vulture and more. By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .

Chief Executive Marc Benioff says his company is doubling down on the use of artificial intelligence, using the technology to automate dozens of workloads that were, until recently, done by humans. In an interview with Bloomberg, Benioff (pictured) said AI agents are now performing as much as 30% to 50% of all the work at his company. “All of us have to get our head around this idea that AI could do things that before, we were doing, and we can move on to do higher-value work,” Benioff said. The problem for some Salesforce employees is that they’ll need to find another employer who’s willing to pay them to perform that higher-value work. Earlier this year, the company announced it’s laying off about 1,000 of its staff. Although it has also announced plans to hire another 1,000, these new employees will be focused on selling its Agentforce technology. What that means is that those new workers will be tasked with urging other companies to adopt AI that can automate work normally done by humans, potentially encouraging them to replace some of their own employees. It’s a worrying trend that seems to be catching on. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote a letter to employees where he discussed the company’s increased adoption of generative AI tools and admitted that it will likely need “fewer people” in future than it currently employs. The rise of AI comes at a time when technology companies are looking for new ways to try and cut costs and boost efficiencies, and many have already announced plans to achieve that by sacrificing human workers. For instance, Microsoft Corp. had already cut more than 6,000 jobs in May and is now reportedly undergoing a second round of layoffs while investing more in AI, according to Fast Company. Google LLC has also reportedly trimmed people from various departments. The website Layoffs.fyi says more than 63,000 jobs have disappeared in the tech industry so far this year, and there are growing reasons to think AI is at least partly responsible for this trend. In his latest newsletter, Brian Merchant, author of “Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech,” writes that he has spoken with dozens of tech industry workers who have been affected by the adoption of AI. He claims that the technology is rapidly reshaping Silicon Valley’s workforces. According to Merchant, an employee at CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. told him that his company’s recent round of layoffs saw many new hires booted out and replaced with AI, despite saying publicly it was about cutting underperforming staff. “AI has literally killed many jobs at CrowdStrike this week,” the employee said. An employee at Dropbox Inc. made similar claims about his employer, saying that during its recent round of layoffs, the entire team focused on improving the reliability of its products was let go in favor of AI tools that can automate this work. Benioff told Bloomberg that the workforce is now undergoing a “digital labor revolution” and said his company’s AI agents can perform work with an accuracy of about 93%. “It’s pretty good, but it’s not realistic to hit 100%,” Benioff said, pointing out that other companies are at “much lower levels because they don’t have as much data and metadata.” Support our open free content by sharing and engaging with our content and community.

Title: Monster and CareerBuilder, once popular with job seekers, file for bankruptcy

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/26/2025 3:14:47 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Monster and CareerBuilder, once two of the most popular websites for job seekers at the height of the dot-com era, have filed for bankruptcy. The two sites, which merged last year to become one entity named Monster + CareerBuilder, voluntary filed for Chapter 11 Tuesday, announcing that the company is selling various parts of its businesses to several buyers as part of a court-supervised process, a press release said. Monster and CareerBuilder were some of the biggest companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the former brand so popular that it often bought Super Bowl commercials promoting its services. However, both have fallen out of favor for job hunters with the rise of competitors like Indeed, Glassdoor and Microsoft-owned LinkedIn in recent years. Jeff Furman, CEO of CareerBuilder + Monster, said in statement that its “business has been affected by a challenging and uncertain macroeconomic environment” and determined that “initiating this court-supervised sale process is the best path toward maximizing the value of our businesses and preserving jobs.” The most recognizable part of CareerBuilder and Monster — their job boards — is being sold to JobGet, a platform for gig and hourly workers searching for jobs. Monster Government Services, which provides software to state and federal governments, is being sold to Canadian-based Valsoft Corporation. Also, its media division — the two companies own Military.com and FastWeb.com — is being sold to Canadian media company Valnet. All purchases require court approval, with the sales subject to higher offers. Furman said the company is “making difficult but necessary decisions to reduce costs and help ensure a seamless transition of our businesses,” including layoffs. It has received $20 million in financing to keep operating during the bankruptcy process. (Excerpt) Read more at cnn.com ...

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Radio broadcaster and podcast company Audacy is shuttering Pineapple Street Studios, which had produced original audio shows and companion podcasts for TV shows like “House of the Dragon,” “Severance” and “The Last of Us.” With the shutdown of Pineapple Street, nearly 30 employees are being laid off, according to sources familiar with the company. Audacy, previously known as Entercom Communications, had acquired Pineapple Street for a reported $18 million in 2019.

He Treats His Employees With Disdain... He Is Not a Nice Man' An Audacy spokesperson said in a statement, “This difficult decision aligns our resources with our core strengths and the most promising growth areas for our podcasting business. We’re sorry to say goodbye to talented colleagues and are grateful for their contributions.” Popular on Variety Audacy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year as it looked to reduce its debt load. The one-time publicly traded company emerged from bankruptcy in September 2024 under a new ownership group led by controlling shareholder Soros Fund Management. In March, Audacy conducted a broad round of layoffs, cutting about 200 employees across divisions. Pineapple’s shows for TV networks included official podcasts for HBO and HBO Max series “And Just Like That…,” “Chernobyl,” “Dune: Prophecy,” “Hacks,” “House of the Dragon” and “The Last of Us.” Its companion shows for Apple TV+ include podcasts for “Foundation” and “Severance.” According to its website, Pineapple also sold multiple originals for TV and film development, including “Wind of Change” to Hulu, “Missing Richard Simmons” to Amazon Studios, “Heaven’s Gate” to HBO Max and “The Clearing” to Chernin Entertainment. Audacy plans to continue producing podcasts in association with other media companies. Pineapple Street had produced the first two seasons of Apple TV+’s official “Severance” podcast. Going forward, that is now being produced by Audacy Podcasts, in partnership with Red Hour and Great Scott. Five new episodes of “The Severance Podcast With Ben Stiller & Adam Scott” will be released weekly on Thursdays beginning June 26, available across all podcast platforms. In addition, a set of new episodes is slated to be released in the fall of 2025. According to the Pineapple Street Studios site, the company was founded in 2016 by Jenna Weiss-Berman and Max Linsky. The studio has staff based in Brooklyn, Los Angeles and Atlanta. In March, Audacy named Kelli Turner its permanent president and CEO while also announcing the departure of four top execs. The shutdown of Pineapple Street was first reported by Bloomberg. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

June 26, 2025 17:45 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a forward share split for the GraniteShares 2x Long PLTR (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of these splits. After the close of the markets on July 08, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a forward split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: As a result of the share split, shareholders of the Fund will receive fifteen shares for each share held as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the number of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares will increase by the approximate percentage indicated above. The ticker and CUSIP will not be affected by the transaction. The share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on July 08, 2025 (the “Record Date”), payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a split-adjusted basis on July 09, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately one-fifteenth. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical fifteen-for-one split on a shareholder’s investment. 15-for-1 forward split About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City.

This agreement is effective until December 31, 2025, and it may be terminated before that date only by the Trust’s Board of Trustees. GraniteShares Advisors LLC may request recoupment of previously waived fees and paid expenses from the Fund for three years from the date such fees and expenses were waived or paid, if such reimbursement will not cause the Fund’s total expense ratio to exceed the expense limitation in place at the time of the waiver and/or expense payment and the expense limitation in place at the time of the recoupment.(2) Estimated total cost in the absence of fee waiver or reimbursement.Contact Information:William Rhind, CEOGraniteShares Inc+1 646 876 5049william.rhind@graniteshares.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the GraniteShares funds (the “Funds”) carefully before investing.

Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses.

June 26, 2025 17:45 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a forward share split for the GraniteShares 2x Long PLTR (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of these splits. After the close of the markets on July 08, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a forward split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: As a result of the share split, shareholders of the Fund will receive fifteen shares for each share held as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the number of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares will increase by the approximate percentage indicated above. The ticker and CUSIP will not be affected by the transaction. The share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on July 08, 2025 (the “Record Date”), payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a split-adjusted basis on July 09, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately one-fifteenth. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical fifteen-for-one split on a shareholder’s investment. 15-for-1 forward split About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares offers the following leveraged single stock ETFs: In addition, GraniteShares’ ETF suite includes the following ETFs: (1) GraniteShares Advisors LLC has contractually agreed to waive its fees and/or pay for operating expenses of the Fund to ensure that total annual fund operating expenses (exclusive of any (i) interest, (ii) brokerage fees and commission, (iii) acquired fund fees and expenses, (iv) fees and expenses associated with instruments in other collective investment vehicles or derivative instruments (including for example options and swap fees and expenses), (v) interest and dividend expense on short sales, (vi) taxes, (vii) other fees related to underlying investments (such as option fees and expenses or swap fees and expenses), (viii) expenses incurred in connection with any merger or reorganization or (ix) extraordinary expenses such as litigation) will not exceed 1.15%. This agreement is effective until December 31, 2025, and it may be terminated before that date only by the Trust’s Board of Trustees. GraniteShares Advisors LLC may request recoupment of previously waived fees and paid expenses from the Fund for three years from the date such fees and expenses were waived or paid, if such reimbursement will not cause the Fund’s total expense ratio to exceed the expense limitation in place at the time of the waiver and/or expense payment and the expense limitation in place at the time of the recoupment.(2) Estimated total cost in the absence of fee waiver or reimbursement.Contact Information:William Rhind, CEOGraniteShares Inc+1 646 876 5049william.rhind@graniteshares.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the GraniteShares funds (the “Funds”) carefully before investing.

June 26, 2025 17:45 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a forward share split for the GraniteShares 2x Long PLTR (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of these splits. After the close of the markets on July 08, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a forward split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: As a result of the share split, shareholders of the Fund will receive fifteen shares for each share held as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the number of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares will increase by the approximate percentage indicated above. The ticker and CUSIP will not be affected by the transaction. The share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on July 08, 2025 (the “Record Date”), payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a split-adjusted basis on July 09, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately one-fifteenth. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical fifteen-for-one split on a shareholder’s investment. 15-for-1 forward split About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares offers the following leveraged single stock ETFs: In addition, GraniteShares’ ETF suite includes the following ETFs: (1) GraniteShares Advisors LLC has contractually agreed to waive its fees and/or pay for operating expenses of the Fund to ensure that total annual fund operating expenses (exclusive of any (i) interest, (ii) brokerage fees and commission, (iii) acquired fund fees and expenses, (iv) fees and expenses associated with instruments in other collective investment vehicles or derivative instruments (including for example options and swap fees and expenses), (v) interest and dividend expense on short sales, (vi) taxes, (vii) other fees related to underlying investments (such as option fees and expenses or swap fees and expenses), (viii) expenses incurred in connection with any merger or reorganization or (ix) extraordinary expenses such as litigation) will not exceed 1.15%. This agreement is effective until December 31, 2025, and it may be terminated before that date only by the Trust’s Board of Trustees. GraniteShares Advisors LLC may request recoupment of previously waived fees and paid expenses from the Fund for three years from the date such fees and expenses were waived or paid, if such reimbursement will not cause the Fund’s total expense ratio to exceed the expense limitation in place at the time of the waiver and/or expense payment and the expense limitation in place at the time of the recoupment.(2) Estimated total cost in the absence of fee waiver or reimbursement.Contact Information:William Rhind, CEOGraniteShares Inc+1 646 876 5049william.rhind@graniteshares.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the GraniteShares funds (the “Funds”) carefully before investing.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved. None of the Funds should be relied upon as a complete investment program.

The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses.

Title: CoreWeave revives bid for Core Scientific causing shares to surge 33%

CORZ shares jumped nearly 34% on intraday fueled by the acquisition rumors. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. CoreWeave is negotiating to acquire Bitcoin (BTC) miner-turned-compute host Core Scientific, the Wall Street Journal reported on June 26, citing people familiar with the matter. The cloud infrastructure company attempted to acquire the miner for $5.75 per share in June 2024 but withdrew after Core Scientific’s board deemed the price inadequate. Core Scientific and CoreWeave have not issued public statements on the negotiations. Core Scientific’s CORZ stock was trading at $16.44 as of press time, up 33.7% on the session and more than 3x from last year’s proposal. The rally followed a year-to-date slide of about 15% that left the miner trading well below the all-time high it set after emerging from bankruptcy protection in January. CoreWeave, which went public in March with a $75 billion capitalization, lists Microsoft as its largest customer, accounting for 62% of 2024 revenue, and rents Nvidia GPUs to corporate clients that include Meta Platforms and IBM. Executives at Core Scientific dismissed last year’s $1 billion overture as “unsolicited” and below intrinsic value, then signed 12-year hosting agreements that commit the miner to deliver 200 megawatts (MW) of power for CoreWeave’s high-performance-computing clusters. Board members stated at the time that the arrangement would generate approximately $3.5 billion in cumulative revenue and help diversify income away from block subsidies after the April 2024 Bitcoin halving. Core Scientific already hosts 16 MW of CoreWeave GPUs at its Austin campus, and plans staged expansions across several sites in Texas and Oklahoma. The parties allegedly aim to finalize terms within weeks if talks stay on track, the sources said. Yet, neither side disclosed price parameters. Core Scientific’s rapid pivot toward AI infrastructure, combined with a power-constrained data-center market, could justify a premium well above the miner’s undisturbed value, bankers following the situation noted. CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator seeks to expand capacity to meet the cloud-AI demand that exceeds current inventory across hyperscale providers. Core Scientific controls about 724 megawatts of contracted power across its US footprint and ranks among North America’s top owners of immersion-cooled mining rigs. The miner’s ability to repurpose part of that load for GPU computing aligns with CoreWeave’s push to secure low-cost electricity and ready-built shells, avoiding multiyear greenfield construction. If negotiations succeed, CoreWeave will absorb a fleet of Bitmain S21-class miners and a pipeline of brownfield sites that can flip to GPU racks. Core Scientific shareholders would receive cash or stock at a yet-to-be-determined ratio.

Title: Grads facing tough job market

Time Published: 2025-06-26T20:00:13Z
Full Content:
WASHINGTON — While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn’t found a job in the industry that surrounds her. “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration’s tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artificial intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government’s monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company’s corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”

Black Friday is one of the biggest sales events of the year. Last year, Shopify merchants drove a record-breaking $11.5 billion in sales during the Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) weekend. With so many consumers open to shopping during the holiday weekend, leaning on tried and tested marketing channels can open the floodgates to more revenue in the fourth quarter. For many retailers, that’s email marketing. Email is the third-most influential channel on holiday purchase decisions, beating influencer endorsements, in-person experiences, and conversations with retail associates in-store. But when so many retailers rely on this direct line of communication to promote holiday sales, it’s difficult to stand out in a subscriber’s crowded inbox. This guide shares innovative Black Friday email marketing strategies to try this year, with best practices and examples from leading retailers. Customer data is the most valuable asset any ecommerce business has. It allows you to tailor email outreach and deliver on customers’ expectations for a personalized shopping experience. Yet 85% of internet users want to do more to protect their online privacy, meaning this strategy can be difficult to implement. Before the holiday season arrives, take stock of the customer data you currently have. If your email list is small or you don’t have supplementary information to personalize campaigns to existing subscribers, deploy lead generation campaigns to gather more holiday season customer data. For example: Because Shopify offers a customer data platform (CDP) by default, any first-party data you’ve collected on your customers gets combined in a unified customer profile. Whenever they share their email address or phone number, this data—such as their order history, loyalty points they’ve earned, previous emails they’ve opened, and/or customer service tickets they’ve raised—all funnel back to one place, giving you one source of truth for every shopper. Black Friday might only last one day, but consumers are still open to making holiday purchases in the run up to the big event. Klaviyo found that more than half of consumers think a month earlier than November is the ideal time for brands to initiate their holiday shopping season sales. Most retailers start seeding their Black Friday email promotions 21 days before the big event—a strategy dubbed “Black November,” which includes other holiday shopping dates: The majority of consumers look for discounts and sales during this period—so much so, 7 in 10 consider price the top factor in their holiday purchase decisions, beating quality (61%), variety (34%), and warranties or returns policies (31%). Take advantage of consumers’ openness to pre-Black Friday promotions by creating a holiday calendar. Perhaps you give your email list early access to your sale, or build hype around a new product drop by teasing it to subscribers, with an automated series like this: Not all holiday shoppers are the same. Some might be looking for gifts for a loved one—others might want to take advantage of a hefty discount to buy a product that’s been on their wishlist for months. Segmentation allows you to identify these buyer preferences and deliver personalized Black Friday email marketing campaigns. Key Black Friday customer segments to email include: Customers who’ve visited your New Orleans store within the last six months, for instance, could receive an email that invites them to your retail store’s exclusive holiday sale which starts two days before Black Friday. Yet instead of relying solely on historical data to forecast each segment’s next steps, lean on predictive analytics. These tools digest large datasets using machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately predict what a customer will do next. 💡Tip: Shopify’s segmentation features pull data from unified customer profiles to group customers based on qualities they share. Choose from prebuilt segment templates, or build your own with the ShopifyQL query editor. All segments are dynamic—subscribers will move in and out of segments automatically when data from their unified profile changes. Segmentation isn’t the only way to personalize emails around the Black Friday weekend. Dynamic content blocks adjust smaller sections of your email, instead of sending the same email to everyone who fits your segmentation criteria. Let’s say, for example, that you’ve defined a segment of VIP customers to target during Black Friday. Subscribers have one thing in common—they have a customer lifetime value of over $500—but they don’t all share the same buying behaviors. Some have saved the loyalty rewards they’ve earned—others have made a portion of their purchases in-store. Further personalize the Black Friday emails that each subscriber in this segment receives with dynamic content blocks. That could be: Black Friday sales are effective because they’re exclusive—either in terms of product quantity (for example, a limited amount of inventory) or because the promotion ends at a specific time. Lean into this time sensitivity and encourage Black Friday subscribers to take advantage now rather than later. This scarcity can induce the fear of missing out, a psychological phenomenon that influences people to buy even when they didn’t intend on doing so. Effective marketing techniques to create urgency in your Black Friday emails include: reMarkable, for example, has a countdown timer in their email to announce Black Friday is ending. It offers visual representation of when the deal ends, instead of just a generic “Sale ends tonight!” message. Email inboxes are a crowded place to be at the best of times—never mind on Black Friday, when every retailer wants to capitalize on consumers’ willingness to buy. Email marketing platform Omnisend processed 1.13 billion emails in the week surrounding BFCM. Klaviyo reported similar figures: at its peak, merchants sent 420 million messages in a single hour on Black Friday. An email subject line is the first thing that subscribers see when your campaign lands in their inbox. A best practice is to split-test strategies such as: Here are some real examples that incorporate these best practices and stood out to me during the Black Friday weekend last year: Promotions and flash drops can incentivize holiday shoppers to make impulsive purchases. Remove the biggest barrier to them doing so—finding the money to pay for their order—by offering buy now, pay later (BNPL). During the BFCM weekend last year, consumers spent over $686.3 million on BNPL purchases, up 8.8% from the year before. Of those who have used this type of service, almost a third say they’d be more likely to spend money on discretionary goods if the retailer offered BNPL as an option. Shop Pay Installments offers an easy way to add BNPL options at checkout. Customers can choose to divide their purchases into smaller, more manageable installments. Combined with Shop Pay, the best-converting checkout on the internet, it’s no surprise that Shop Pay Installments has been proven to reduce cart abandonment by 28% and increase average order value by as much as 50%. Email might be the only direct line of communication you have with Black Friday customers, but it’s not the only way to command their attention. SMS marketing is the easiest integration since most email marketing platforms, including Klaviyo, offer SMS integration as standard. For example, you could send an email campaign to a particular segment, then use SMS to follow up with those who haven’t yet redeemed the offer or opened the email. It’s an approach proven to get results: Klaviyo reports that merchants who integrated SMS into their Black Friday email marketing strategy experienced a 20% YoY increase in ecommerce revenue during BFCM, accounting for more than $100 million in gross merchandise value. Email can also complement paid advertising strategies as costs skyrocket throughout Black Friday season. Shopify Audiences builds custom retargeting lists to export to platforms like Meta, Google Ads, and TikTok. It’s helped merchants like Happy Hippo achieve a 4.7x return on ad spend (ROAS) while cutting customer acquisition costs (CAC) by 72%. “Shopify Audiences is a huge benefit for Plus merchants,” says CEO and lead product designer Adam Biel. “It has helped lower customer acquisition costs so our investments can stretch much further with Facebook ads.” Transactional emails tend to be overlooked when marketers attempt to compete with other retailers for attention during Black Friday. Yet they’re an opportunity to strengthen relationships with the customers you’ve already acquired. Comb through the automated emails you send as standard when customers complete a certain action. Here are some examples and ideas to optimize them: Black Friday, Cyber Monday regularly break records, but not all of them are good. Most customers acquired during BFCM have a lower lifetime value. This occurs partly because these customers were being opportunistic and taking advantage of your promotions, but also because your brand loses mindshare throughout the year. Design an email retention sequence to retain holiday shoppers after Black Friday ends. You could: 💡Tip: Shopify Flow takes the logistical hassle out of these holiday marketing automations. Work from prebuilt templates—such as inviting shoppers to your loyalty program when their unified customer profile meets specific criteria—or custom code your own. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of new promotions and segmentation strategies that turn email subscribers into paying customers—so much so, that retailers often forget the fundamentals. Here’s a quick reminder of the email optimization best practices to keep in mind while writing Black Friday emails: If you’re in the midst of a creative lull and are searching for ideas on how to make your Black Friday emails stand out, draw inspiration from these examples. Shoppers are especially prone to abandoning online carts in search of better Black Friday deals. This cart recovery email from Pulp & Press reminds each individual customer of the products they abandoned, with a reminder that it’s the biggest sale of the year—and that they should take advantage now, before the deal ends. Black Friday might be the biggest online sales event of the year, but it’s not always the most profitable. Discounts tend to lure in low-value customers who might only purchase from you when products are heavily discounted. Detox Market’s Black Friday email is a great example of how to combat this with tiered promotions. The more customers spend, the bigger the discount. Freaks of Nature leans into scarcity with their “almost gone” Black Friday email. The call to action button tells people to “secure” their shirt—more strategic than just “get yours today.” Plus, it uses price anchoring to showcase the before and after sale price of each bestseller. There are also direct checkout links for email subscribers to complete their purchases without searching the online store for the perfect item. It’s tempting to shout about your bestselling products or hefty discounts with innovative email designs. Home furnishings brand Revival takes a different approach. Instead, the brand shares a letter authored by their founder, which wishes them a wonderful holiday weekend with a gentle nudge to buy the item on their wishlist. The email also features a note beneath the sign-off that teases the following day’s email. This tactic can increase open rates during Black Friday—subscribers are already on the lookout for the campaign. With so much competition to reach your target market during Black Friday, leaning into your brand values can attract conscious consumers who care more about sticking to their morals than impressive discounts. Deodorant brand Fussy, for example, is a certified B-Corp that sells deodorants made with natural ingredients and refillable cases designed to reduce plastic waste. Their target audience cares about sustainability, hence why the retailer’s Black Friday email marketing strategy was to rename the event “Green Week.” Email marketing spans every stage of the customer journey, from aiding initial product discovery to encouraging customer retention. Shopify has everything you need to personalize this end-to-end experience, including unified customer profiles and segmentation to put your data to work. Plus, when holiday email campaigns drive record levels of website traffic, you don’t have to worry about outages or downtime. Shopify’s infrastructure handled over 57.3 PB of data, 1.19 trillion edge requests, and 10.5 trillion database queries during the last BFCM. It’s why leading brands like Represent, Knix, and Muscle Nation trust Shopify to capitalize on Black Friday sales. “Black Friday can be nerve-wracking,” says Stefan Lewis, chief digital officer at Represent. “But Shopify has always helped us in terms of increasing bandwidth and we’ve never run into any issues around site speed.” Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) email is a marketing strategy where retailers reach their target customers through targeted emails. These holiday campaigns typically include promotions, sales, discounts, gift suggestions, and product recommendations. To write an effective Black Friday email, lead with a time-sensitive offer in the subject line and header. Use mobile-first design, highlight bestsellers or exclusives, and include urgency-driven CTAs like “get yours before it’s too late.” The best time to send Black Friday emails is in the runup to the big event. Most consumers start holiday gift shopping before Black Friday arrives. A pre-launch campaign can ensure your brand is top of mind when they’re ready to buy. Use targeted emails to announce a Black Friday sale. Divide your audience into segments based on traits they share, and include contextual recommendations—for example, discounts on products similar to those they’ve bought.

Title: Salesforce CEO Claims Half of the Company’s Work Is Now Done by AI

While many companies that went all in on AI have since pulled back, Salesforce is going full steam ahead. In an interview with Bloomberg, CEO Marc Benioff claimed that as much as 30% to 50% of the company’s work is now completed by AIâthough no word on how much of his role personally has been made redunant or how much of his $39.6 million in compensation that he’ll be giving up. âAll of us have to get our head around this idea that AI could do things that before, we were doing, and we can move on to do higher value work,â Benioff said. In the case of some of Salesforce’s employees, the whole “move on to do higher value work” thing will have to happen somewhere else. Earlier this year, the company announced that it was laying off 1,000 people. It also reportedly plans to hire another 1,000 who will be focused on selling the company’s own AI agent technology, Agentforce. Put another way, Salesforce is hiring real people to sell other companies on adopting AI to replace some of its human workforce, which certainly seems like it would be one of the ten plagues of late-stage capitalism. Benioff and Salesforce are far from the only firm that is signaling that they will push for the AI revolution, whether it’s ready or not. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sent a letter to employees talking up the use of generative AI across the company’s workflows, while slipping in a little note about how AI will lead to Amazon needing “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” That seems to be the underlying message of much of tech’s embrace of AI: get ready for layoffs. Silicon Valley has gone from bragging about how many jobs it can create to bragging about how small it can shrink its workforce. Microsoft is in the midst of a second round of layoffs, per Fast Company, after already cutting its staff by 6,000 in May and shifting lots of money into AI investments. Other companies like Google and Bumble have been trimming people from departments within their firms, as well. According to Layoffs.fyi, the tech industry has laid off more than 63,000 workers in 2025 so far. Oftentimes, whether it’s made explicit or not, corporate adoption of AI is the underlying reason for the cuts. Brian Merchant, author of Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech, recently spoke with tech workers who have been affected by AI and found that the technology is reshaping jobs and workforces as a whole. An employee of CrowdStrike told Merchant that while the company positioned its recent layoff as cutting underperforming employees, many of them were new hires who the company decided were replaceable. “AI has literally killed many jobs at CrowdStrike this week.” Another at Dropbox said that their team that focused on improving the service’s reliability was let go in favor of promoting a new AI-powered tool. artificial intellienceLaborlayoffsmarc benioffSalesforce Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Starlink rival AST SpaceMobile is pitching its satellite-to-phone technology to US military groups, a sign that AST and SpaceX are poised to go head-to-head in competing for defense contracts. Texas-based AST SpaceMobile has already demonstrated that its giant satellites can power voice and video calls on consumer smartphones in cellular dead zones. But on Thursday, the company touted a successful demo of its technology for "tactical satellite communication" purposes. The demo, conducted in Hawaii, involved using AST's BlueBird satellites to beam communications to a Tactical Assault Kit (TAK), which is usually mapping-related software designed for military operations. TAK can also be installed on smartphones. "The field test showcased key defense-related use cases, including real-time connectivity to the Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) over a VPN, multimedia streaming via TAK, and secure multi-party video calls, all executed on standard, unmodified smartphones,” AST said in the announcement. Importantly, representatives from the US Navy, Marine Corps, Army, US Space Command, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD R&E) FutureG team attended the demo. AST currently only has five satellites in orbit when it needs between 45 to 60 for global coverage. Still, the company says the demo showed how its satellites can supply connectivity to phones configured for military purposes. "This was the first in a series of planned prototype demonstrations to evaluate space-based mobile broadband for defense applications, with additional testing, including over open ocean environments, planned in the coming months," AST said. The news also shows how the company will try to compete with SpaceX’s Starlink for defense funding, in addition to serving consumers through mobile carriers. SpaceX has already received millions from various governments for providing Starlink broadband access to military forces in Ukraine. The US Navy has also adopted Starlink across its fleet and bases.

Starlink rival AST SpaceMobile is pitching its satellite-to-phone technology to US military groups, a sign that AST and SpaceX are poised to go head-to-head in competing for defense contracts. Texas-based AST SpaceMobile has already demonstrated that its giant satellites can power voice and video calls on consumer smartphones in cellular dead zones. But on Thursday, the company touted a successful demo of its technology for "tactical satellite communication" purposes. The demo, conducted in Hawaii, involved using AST's BlueBird satellites to beam communications to a Tactical Assault Kit (TAK), which is usually mapping-related software designed for military operations. TAK can also be installed on smartphones. "The field test showcased key defense-related use cases, including real-time connectivity to the Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) over a VPN, multimedia streaming via TAK, and secure multi-party video calls, all executed on standard, unmodified smartphones,” AST said in the announcement. Importantly, representatives from the US Navy, Marine Corps, Army, US Space Command, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD R&E) FutureG team attended the demo. AST currently only has five satellites in orbit when it needs between 45 to 60 for global coverage. Still, the company says the demo showed how its satellites can supply connectivity to phones configured for military purposes. "This was the first in a series of planned prototype demonstrations to evaluate space-based mobile broadband for defense applications, with additional testing, including over open ocean environments, planned in the coming months," AST said. The news also shows how the company will try to compete with SpaceX’s Starlink for defense funding, in addition to serving consumers through mobile carriers. SpaceX has already received millions from various governments for providing Starlink broadband access to military forces in Ukraine. The US Navy has also adopted Starlink across its fleet and bases. In AST’s case, the company has partnered with Maryland-based Fairwinds Technologies, which specializes in bringing commercial tech to military customers. In 2023, AST reached an agreement with Fairwinds to explore marketing the satellite technology to the military market.

Title: Why Companies Need To Institute Stricter AI Policies

ByMegan Poinski andCIO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCIO, Forbes Staff. As the hype grows around AI and more people try it out, many are using it at work to see how it can help them become more efficient. But there’s a real problem: Some employees are using public instances of chatbots, putting proprietary company data at risk by giving an open LLM access. Others use the company’s access to AI, but input highly sensitive and personal data, like Social Security numbers and financial data. A new study from technology security company Kiteworks found that 27% of companies reported that nearly a third of all of the data sent to AI systems is the type of information that should be kept private, like company records, employee information and trade secrets. (It could be more; 17% of companies don’t know how much private data ends up getting sent to AI.) It’s a problem that’s growing. A Stanford University report on AI found a 56.4% increase in security incidents with the technology last year. While it may seem obvious to the tech savvy, many employees might not know the risks of this kind of AI sharing, and 83% of companies only rely on training or warning emails to let them know. Kiteworks found that just 17% have automatic controls that keep employees from uploading sensitive information to public AI tools. Further, most companies don’t have much of an AI governance structure—only 9%, according to Deloitte research cited by Kiteworks. The study results show that companies need to add policies and infrastructure to control employee use of AI and protect their own data. This kind of use can cause real damage to companies—not to mention their employees and clients. The study concludes that companies need to acknowledge the threat, deploy controls that can be verified, and ensure that they can stand up to regulatory scrutiny. “With incidents surging, zero-day attacks targeting the security infrastructure itself, and the vast majority lacking real visibility or control, the window for implementing meaningful protections is rapidly closing,” Kiteworks CMO Tim Freestone said in a statement. Many people still haven’t grasped how to truly use AI to benefit their company—we all know its practical business functions go beyond asking a chatbot for advice. I talked to Lindsay Phillips, cofounder and COO of tech change coaching firm SkyPhi Studios, about how to bring AI to your company and get people using it. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang speaks at the VivaTech technology startup and innovation fair in Paris earlier this month. Nvidia is back on top, pulling ahead of Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company. A research note on Wednesday from Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised his price target for Nvidia’s stock from $175 to $250. Baruah wrote that Nvidia will lead the next “Golden Wave” for generative AI, and will see “stronger-than-anticipated demand.” The research note—as well as Nvidia’s annual shareholder meeting, where CEO Jensen Huang laid out an optimistic view of the company’s future—drove the company’s stock to hit a record high of $154.43. While share prices dropped somewhat before markets closed, it was a banner day for the chips company. Chips and robotics company, that is. At the annual meeting, Nvidia positioned itself squarely in the robotics and physical industrial AI spaces. In the company’s annual report, Huang wrote that so far this year, Nvidia has fundamentally transformed itself from a chip maker to a builder of infrastructure. While AI data centers will continue to be important, AI-powered robots in factories, hospitals, farms and cities will be what moves society forward in the not-so-distant future. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” Huang said at the meeting, according to CNBC. An Iranian man stands in his apartment in Tehran, which was destroyed by Israeli attacks. While it seems for now that the physical conflict between Iran and Israel—which the U.S. inserted itself into by bombing Iranian nuclear facilities—is on hold, the war will likely still be bitterly fought online. Forbes’ Thomas Brewster writes that Iran, which has a “robust cyber apparatus” according to Middle East cybersecurity experts, is likely to launch disruptive attacks on U.S. and Israeli interests. For the U.S. government, this could be especially challenging. Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency has lost many experienced employees and does not even have a permanent director. Insiders told Forbes that CISA already is stretched thin, but coordinated attacks from Iran could make it much worse. The PR war over how the attacks are seen is also riddled with conflicting imagery. AI-generated Iranian propaganda showing a rocket launch and a convoy of tanks and missiles have racked up millions of views, writes Forbes’ Emily Baker-White. These videos, which were seen throughout social media, abruptly disappeared. None of the platforms have any policies against releasing propaganda, and the videos didn’t appear to be labeled as AI-generated. getty AI can be a force for good, but it can also be nefarious. New research from Barracuda, Columbia University and the University of Chicago found that AI writes more than half of all spam email now, writes Forbes senior contributor Davey Winder. This includes the vast majority of messages in your personal account’s spam folder—but it’s also getting prevalent in business emails as well. About 14% of business inbox attacks, in which often senior people in organizations are targeted with requests for financial transactions, are written by AI. Winder writes that it makes sense to use AI for spam. It tends to do a passable job of writing with proper grammar and spelling across a variety of languages. It can also write in a convincing way to provoke a recipient to respond. The study found that attackers seem to be using AI to draft different versions of spam and hacking emails, searching for the best way to get a recipient’s attention. SkyPhi Studios cofounder and COO Lindsay Phillips. AI truly can transform the way we do business, but in order for it to make a difference, employees actually need to use it. AI is unlike any other tech shift in recent years, and it can be difficult for everyone at a company to embrace it. I talked to Lindsay Phillips, cofounder and COO of tech change coaching firm SkyPhi Studios, about the best way to get your employees through these challenges. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What is the biggest hurdle that you see to widespread AI adoption in companies? Phillips: The biggest hurdle is companies approaching AI as a software shift, and AI is really a mindset shift. It’s not just about teaching people how to do the same work in a different tool. They have to completely change how they think about work, how they think about the value that they’re bringing to the workplace, how they approach their workflows. Companies that are just trying to make tools available and don’t help people understand how to use it, how to adopt it successfully and how to integrate it, are running into adoption challenges. How do you get past that roadblock? Understanding how you want people to change to use the tool. Understanding how roles and responsibilities need to change, the RACI [responsibility matrix] that’s required so that folks adopt this tool and integrate it into their workflows. You want to also make sure that leadership across the org understands that strategy. Most folks want to get guidance from their manager, so you want to leverage leadership cascades and really make sure they’re carrying that message forward and reinforcing it. The other thing that we’re seeing with companies that are successful is a community of practice: Creating ambassadors throughout the org, at the ground level, boots on the street, that are supporting their team members and adopting these tools and helping them make that mindset shift. How does the move toward AI compare to other technology shifts in the past, like moving to the cloud and increasing cybersecurity? It definitely feels like we’re driving the car while we’re building the car, so we need our team members to be very collaborative in helping us figure out how to use these tools. Experts are going to be able to tell you how AI is going to be able to make their jobs more productive and be able to help them do their work better. Leadership’s not necessarily going to know that, so it really does need to be a lot more collaborative and agile than it needed to be in the past. In the past, you find requirements, you help people adopt those new ways of working, you meet those requirements. This we’re figuring it out as we go, and it’s much more experimental. What sets the companies that are most successfully integrating AI apart? A comfort with experimentation and a certain amount of comfort with uncertainty of saying, ‘We’re going to give it a try. We’re going to see how it goes, and we’ll pivot as we need to.’ Companies that are very attached to clarity and certainty and always having the right answer are going to struggle with AI adoption. It’s not a linear straight path. It is going to be something you have to figure out as you go. What advice would you give to executives that are trying to get their employees to use AI? The more accessible we can make it, the better. There’s companies doing weekly challenges. Just start to encourage your folks to incorporate it into their daily lives. Encourage folks to share wins. You want to hear about how other people are using these tools so that it can give you ideas of how you can also use it in your day-to-day. It is a massive mindset shift. Approach it with little tiny bites that you can take to start to shift habits daily. As more companies adopt enterprise AI packages, several trends in what they are using and how are coming to the surface. Here are 10 trends that are shaping enterprise LLM use today. While part of business advancement today is all about personal branding and showing the world your expertise and strategic viewpoint, you may feel more comfortable quietly sitting in front of a screen. The good news is that you don’t have to be an extrovert. Here are some tips for shy people who want to build personal brands. After Meta’s deal to take a 49% stake in data-labeling company Scale AI, another company with a very different main business stepped up as a potential giant in data labeling. Which company is it? A.

Title: Gold is Money Good, Brace for Deep Recession

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/26/2025 9:11:06 AM PDT by delta7 Former Wall Street money manager and financial analyst Ed Dowd of PhinanceTechnologies.com has been forecasting “Danger of Deep Worldwide Recession in 2025.” It looks like his thesis is turning out correct. He predicted interest rates would be declining. They did. And inflation has been going down right along with the economy as illegal immigration was being stopped and deportations ramped up. Dowd says, “Our friend Joe Biden spent anywhere between $500 billion to $2 trillion to bring these people in and set them up. Now, that’s all going the wrong way. Trump has shut down the border crossings, and as deportations heat up, that will only add to the problem. There will be a lot of supply, and prices have already started coming down in certain regions, and that is going to accelerate. Inflation is going to be coming down. Chairman Powell is dead-ass wrong. Tariffs are actually deflationary, and he’s holding rates higher for longer. That is going to end up being a big policy error. We think interest rates have peaked for the year. . .. We think the Fed will be forced to cut rates when the hard data comes in the wrong way.” What is Dowd looking at most? Dowd says, “If we did have an oil shock, our thesis of a deep world-wide recession would trigger even faster. During the last twelve days of this Iran/Israel war, I said to my followers, I am watching one thing and one thing only, and that is the price of oil. The price of oil did go up . . . I said if oil breaks out above $80 per barrel, then we’ve got problems. Oil has collapsed, and the oil markets are telling you the Iranians are not going to close the Strait of Hormuz. So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.” That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

Kay and Marco Migueis Ex-ante cost-benefit analyses and other impact assessments are now a standard part of the rulemaking process. Yet some important effects of regulation are difficultâor impossibleâto assess before a rule takes effect. In such cases, ex-post (or retrospective) evaluation, conducted after a rule is in effect, offers an opportunity to measure real-world outcomes that could not reliably be predicted in advance. Such an evaluation can help determine whether a rule achieves its intended goals, whether the imposed costs are justified, and whether any unintended consequences have emerged. However, when rules are not designed with ex-post evaluation in mind, measuring certain impacts may be difficult or impossible in practice. This article discusses options to revise the rulemaking process to avoid this problem. Designing rules with ex-post evaluation in mind would facilitate such evaluations, ultimately leading to better rules. One rationale for evaluating rules is that they can impose costs on the public. To promote efficiency and minimize unintended harm, policymakers may prefer rules that are simple where complexity is unnecessary, inexpensive where high costs can be avoided, and designed to avoid adverse side effects. Recognizing these tradeoffs, the U.S. Congress has required federal agencies to conduct impact analyses for certain rulemakings.2 In addition, a standing executive order mandates that agencies perform cost-and-benefit analyses before issuing major new rules.3, 4 The ex-ante assessments help ensure that regulatory costs are justified and prevent some of the least cost-effective rules from being implemented. However, rules can prove more costly, yield fewer benefits, and produce more undesirable consequences than analysts anticipate in ex-ante assessments. These estimates are inherently uncertain, as they depend on future economic conditions and the reactions of regulated entities. Moreover, behavioral and political factorsâsuch as bureaucratic optimism (Krause and Corder, 2007; Liu, Stoutenborough, and Vedlitz, 2016), ideologically motivated policymaking (Hogwood and Gunn, 1984; Prendergast, 2007), and regulatory capture by special interests (Dal Bo, 2006)âcan cause analysts to overestimate the net benefits of new rules. Current U.S. executive branch policy requires agencies to conduct retrospective analyses to support the periodic review of regulations.5 Similarly, an executive order issued by President Obama encourages independent agencies to conduct retrospective analysisâa recommendation that remains in effect.6 In addition, Section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act mandates that federal agencies periodically review regulations that have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Banking regulators are also required to regularly perform a systematic review of their regulations under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA). While these motivations for ex-post evaluation are evergreen, interest in such evaluations has grown in response to legal and political shifts over the past decade. During the first Trump administration, Executive Order 13771 (2017) required that "â¦any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations." Although the executive order was rescinded during the Biden administration, that rescission was itself reversed in the second Trump administration.7 Executive Order 14192 now requires that the "â¦total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, being finalized this year, shall be significantly less than zero."8 For policymakers aiming to meet such cost-reduction mandates, ex-post evaluation may help quantify regulatory cost changes and track progress toward aggregate cost targets. Further contributing to a changing policy environment, oversight bodies are increasingly pressing federal agencies to provide stronger analytic justification for their rules. For example, guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructs agencies to quantify the total incremental costs or savings of each new and repealed significant regulatory action or guidance document.9 The instructions in this guidance amount to establishing a regulatory cost budget for each agency. If agencies are expected to meet cost targets for new rules, they may be incentivized to identify regulations with high costs and low benefits to repeal or replace. Because retrospective evaluations often yield more accurate estimates of realized costs than ex-ante projections, they can be useful in quantifying current burdens and informing regulatory cost budgeting. Separate from this recent guidance on regulatory cost budgets, the OMB has historically encouraged agencies to plan for ex-post review of regulatory outcomes. In its 2017 annual report to Congress, OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) advised that "Rules should be written and designed to facilitate retrospective analysis of their effects, including consideration of the data that will be needed for future evaluation of the rules' ex-post costs and benefits."10â The currently effective OMB Circular A-4 (2003) similarly supports using retrospective analysis to assess whether a regulation's costs have changed after implementation. The now-rescinded 2023 version of Circular A-4 went further, stating that "â¦agencies may consider the benefits and costs of regulatory alternatives that would facilitate data collection to support future analyses or retrospective review. These alternatives may be especially valuable if there are significant uncertainties about benefits or costs, or if benefits or costs may change over time." In practice, agencies are expected to estimate a rule's costs and benefits before issuance and, in some cases, to design regulations in ways that facilitate later evaluation of their realized impacts. When agencies seek to support their rules with empirical evidence in legal proceedings, ex-post analyses can help demonstrate whether predicted benefits and costs materialized. The need to defend regulations in court may be growing. Two Supreme Court decisions in 2024 significantly increased the legal risks for federal rulemaking. In Corner Post, the Court held that the six-year statute of limitations under the Administrative Procedure Act begins when a regulated party is first subject to the rule, rather than when the rule is finalized, which had been the prior interpretation. In Loper Bright, the Court overturned the Chevron doctrine, which had required courts to defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. This decision shifted interpretive authority from agencies to the judiciary and may lead to greater scrutiny in litigation. While these are only two among many legal risks agencies face, ex-post evaluation may strengthen a rule's legal defensibility by providing evidence that its benefits outweigh its costs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has consistently emphasized the importance of retrospective review in strengthening regulatory quality. In reports from 2007, 2014, and 2018, the GAO called for expanding or improving the use of ex-post evaluation across federal agencies.11 Despite such calls, challenges persist. For example, a 2024 GAO review of independent federal financial regulators found that they had conducted few retrospective reviews of their existing rules.12 Finally, some policymakers may view ex-post evaluation as a tool to promote public trust in the government. Demonstrating that regulatory decisions are reviewed and evidence-based can signal accountability and responsiveness. Research suggests that transparency, such as disclosing government performance, can positively influence citizens' perceptions of government.13 When conducted, ex-post evaluations can help identify rules that are underperforming or no longer justified. In some cases, this evidence may support repeal. In others, evidence of strong performance and low costs could justify expanding a rule's scope: for example, by extending it to additional firms, increasing its stringency, or replacing alternative policies based on demonstrated effectiveness. This article proposes strategies to improve the government's capacity to conduct meaningful ex-post evaluations, supporting such analysis in contexts where policymakers choose to pursue it.14 While ex-post evaluations are incredibly valuable for improving the regulatory environment, conducting them can be difficult. Key challenges include identifying an appropriate counterfactual, gathering data on outcomes, and attributing these outcomes to the rule itself. Fortunately, these challenges can be mitigated when regulations are designed and implemented with evaluation in mind. The sections that follow explore organizational and implementation choices that can support ex-post evaluation.15 Staffing rulemakings with an eye toward ex-post evaluation Ex-post evaluation benefits from the early involvement of evaluation staff in the rulemaking process. Such staff can help identify opportunities to design rules in ways that support future evaluation. The marginal costs of such an assignment are likely to be modest. Under current practices, evaluation staff are often already engaged in the rulemaking processâmaking suggestions to reduce burdens and increase benefits. Asking them to also identify opportunities to support ex-post evaluation is unlikely to add significant cost. However, embedding economic analysis staff in the rulemaking process poses tradeoffs. Their economic expertise can improve the quality of rules, but their participation may also reduce the independence of the evaluation process from policy development. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mitigates this issue by assigning different cost-benefit analysts participate to the drafting and evaluation phases of a ruleâan approach that requires more personnel and increases agency costs.16 But staff responsible for ex-ante impact analysis are often already engaged in the rulemaking process. Asking them to identify opportunities to support ex-post evaluation is unlikely to further reduce their independence. Therefore, the incremental cost of this added responsibility is likely modest, particularly when compared with the broader compliance costs and regulatory burdens of major regulations. To the extent that designing for ex-post evaluation leads to more such evaluations being conducted, costs may rise relative to the current baseline, where formal ex-post analyses are relatively uncommon. However, the cost of conducting these evaluations is typically modest compared to the potential benefitsâsuch as improving the efficacy and efficiency of existing rules. Moreover, by designing rules to support evaluation, agencies may create natural experiments that external researchers can study at no additional cost to taxpayers. In some cases, this could reduce the incremental cost of evaluation to nearly zero. Policymakers should weigh these cost considerations alongside the potential political, procedural, and reputational benefits of ex-post evaluations. Differentiated implementation and application of rules Ex-post evaluation can be facilitated by differentiated application of rules across similar firms. Applying different rules to otherwise comparable entities creates natural treatment and control groups, improving the ability to identify regulatory effects.17 Two commonly used forms of differentiation that support such analyses are: (1) tiered application of rules based on firm size or other relevant criteria and (2) staggered implementation.18 In addition, while pure randomization of regulatory policies across firms is uncommon and poses several challenges, it has been used in public policy and will be discussed at the end of this section. Many regulations apply only to firms that exceed a certain threshold of activity, leaving firms below that threshold exempt.19 This tiered approach can be appropriate because imposing stricter requirements on to certain entities, such as those that are larger and more complex, often yields greater benefits than applying the same rules to other entities.20 Also, regulatory compliance costs tend to increase less than proportionally with activity levels (Brock and Evans, 1985).21 However, tiering can also create incentives for firms to remain below regulatory thresholds to avoid compliance costs, which may discourage growth and reduce economic efficiency.22 In addition to these potential costs and benefits, tiering enables regulators to compare outcomes between firms above and below the threshold, helping to identify the effects of regulation. Ex-post analyses that utilize regulatory thresholds have provided valuable insights into the effects of financial regulations. Examples include Acharya et al. (2018), who found that the introduction of stress testing for large banks led to reductions in credit to risky borrowers; Kay et al. (2014), who found that banks subject to the Durbin amendment experienced substantial declines in interchange income relative to exempt banks, though they offset more than 90 percent of the lost income through higher deposit fees);23 Alvero, Ando, Xiao (2023), who used bunching of banks around Dodd-Frank size thresholds to estimate the costs of the act's regulatory burdens; Bindal et al. (2017), who studied the effects of the $10 billion and $50 billion thresholds that trigger increased bank merger scrutiny; and Wood (2023), who examined how the 2005 amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act and the Community Reinvestment Act affected bank liquidity creation. In addition, many studies use regulatory thresholds to evaluate non-financial regulations.24 These examples demonstrate that ex-post evaluation can provide insights at a limited marginal cost when rules apply differently across otherwise comparable firms. Using tiered thresholds to identify the effects of regulations typically presents several challenges. Ideally, policy implementation would be unanticipated, preventing firms from strategically adjusting their behavior to remain out of scopeâbut this is rarely the case in practice. Still, reducing activity to avoid regulation can be costly, limiting firms' ability to respond.25 And while firms may have some discretion in staying above or below a threshold, ex-post comparisons between those either side of the cutoff can still shed light on how rules affect firm behavior and incentives. Even when firms do not strategically avoid regulatory thresholds, anticipation effects may arise as firms adjust behavior well before formal implementation, in response to rules they expect to face because of speeches, draft proposals, investor pressure, or other signals. Such adjustments are especially likely when compliance is complex, time-consuming, and costly. A firm may also adjust in response to rules that currently apply only to others, anticipating that similar requirements will extend to them in the future. These dynamics complicate causal inference by blurring the timing of firm responses. A related phenomenon is the announcement effect, in which other entities respond immediately when information about rules is publicly disclosed. For instance, securities prices may adjust on the day a regulation is announced, regardless of when it takes effect. Both types of effects can complicate causal inference by shifting behavior away from the formal implementation date, but they differ in timing, observability, and the clarity of the policy signal that drives the response. Another challenge in using tiered requirements to identify policy effects is that certain thresholds trigger multiple regulations simultaneously. For example, under the Dodd-Frank Act, crossing the $50 billion asset threshold subjects banks to several prudential standards, including enhanced stress testing, liquidity, and risk management requirements.26 Because these requirements were implemented concurrently, isolating their individual effects is difficult. Nevertheless, even when multiple rules are triggered at once, comparing firms above and below the threshold can provide useful insightsâespecially when estimating the most direct and distinct effects of a requirement, such as the impact of liquidity rules on holdings of high-quality liquid assets. In addition, when new requirements are layered onto an existing threshold, it may be possible to identify their marginal impact if the new rule was not anticipated at the time threshold was originally introduced. For example, while the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act established prudential liquidity requirements for large firms, a key element of the liquidity frameworkâthe net stable funding ratioâwas proposed in 2016, finalized in February 2021, and become effective in July 2021. Tiered application of regulations can support a long-term strategy of expanding regulations that demonstrate positive net benefits and scaling back or eliminating those that do not. Policymakers can (1) apply a rule initially to a narrow set of firms, (2) conduct an ex-post evaluation of the rule's costs and benefits, and (3) adjust the scope of the rule based on the findings.27 Arguably, certain expansions of banking requirements have followed this pattern. For instance, the long-term debt requirement for large banking organizations proposed in 2023 was influenced by the perceived successes of similar mandates for global systemically important banks introduced in 2016.28 Still, regulators could benefit from applying this approach more consistently, regularly reassessing whether to expand or narrow regulations in response to ex-post evidence. Staggered implementation, whether based on predetermined criteria or random assignment, is another common feature of rules that can support ex-post evaluation.29 Like tiering, applying a rule to similar firms at different times enables comparisons between early and late adopters, helping to assess a rule's impact. Therefore, regulators may benefit from using staggered implementation more often to evaluate the effectiveness of new policies. In some cases, staggered implementation has been deliberately designed to test policy effects. For instance, the SEC used staggered rollout in 2000 to evaluate the decimalization of stock market prices in 2000, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employed a staggered approach to distribute stimulus payments during the Great Recession.30, 31 Thanks to these clever implementation strategies, we now know far more about the consequences of these policies.32 In other cases, staggering implementation has resulted from practical considerations, such as prioritizing the most relevant entities or varying levels of readiness. For example, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's (FINRA) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE), mandated by the SEC for broker-dealer trade reporting, was initially introduced in 2002 for investment grade corporate bonds with large issuances. Over time, its scope was expanded to cover a broader range of securities, including those with smaller issuances and lower liquidity. This gradual rollout enabled researchers to assess TRACE's effects by comparing securities subject to the requirement with those that remained exempt.33 Staggered implementation has also enabled policy evaluation in cases where the staggering was not intended for that purpose. For example, Bremer and Sommer (2025) evaluated the costs and benefits of the European emission trading regime using incidental variation in implementation timing. Similarly, Barreca, Neidell, and Sanders (2021) used staggered rollout to estimate the benefits of the U.S. Acid Rain Program. Comparable setups exist in U.S. policies on long-term care staffing and overtime protections, but, to our knowledge, no ex-post evaluations have yet exploited this variation.34 Staggered implementation has also been employed in bank regulation and by quasi-regulatory organizations in the private sector. Notable examples include the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard,35 stress-testing requirements for large banks,36 and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).37 These staggered rollouts have enabled valuable ex-post analyses. Some examples include Loudis et al. (2021), who assessed the impact of early CECL adoption during the COVID-19 stress and found that reserves were substantially more responsive to the economic outlook among early adopters; and Banerjee and Mio (2018), who examined the staggered rollout of liquidity regulation in the UK and its effects on bank balance sheets. Staggered implementation also has limitations as a tool for policy evaluation. Because the units serving as controls are typically treated within a short time frame, often a year or two, analyses based on staggered rollout are more informative for short-term outcomes than for outcomes that depend on the long-term state of the regulation. For example, the decimalization of stock prices allowed researchers to assess impact on trading costs, which materialized quickly. By contrast, most banking regulations affect outcomes over longer horizons, and firms may begin adjusting their behavior in anticipation of rules before they take effect. Also, just as with identifying a regulation's effect through tiered application, possible anticipation and announcement effects limit how much staggered implementation can reveal about a regulation's true impact. For these reasons, evaluations based on staggered implementation require caution in interpreting results and modesty about the strength and generalizability of their findings. Although the staggered implementations of TRACE and CECL were not designed for evaluation purposes, they enabled valuable ex-post policy analysis. Like tiering, staggered implementation supports the evaluation of regulatory effectiveness and can inform iterative improvements. Problematic or costly implementations can be slowed or abandoned, while successful ones can be accelerated and expanded when early evidence indicates strong positive effects.38 A more modest alternative to randomized staggered implementation is the use of small-scale pilot programs, in which a regulation is applied, potentially on a voluntary basis, to a limited number of firms for a defined period. These pilots can reduce the cost of experimentation while providing useful comparisons between treated and untreated firms. The SEC has conducted several such pilots, including during the rollout of TRACE, the "up-tick" pilot (which removed a short-sale price test), and the "tick-size" pilot (which increased the minimum price increment for stocks from one to five cents). These experiments have generated multiple studies evaluating the effectiveness of the associated regulatory changes.39 However, the voluntary nature of many pilot programs can limit their value for casual inference (see Harris et al. (2021) for a discussion of these limitations in financial regulation). Beyond short-term randomized staggering, such as the decimalization of stock prices or the IRS stimulus payments, a long-term strategy for evidence-based regulation would involve more open-ended policy experiments using randomization.40 Randomly assigning treatments to comparable units remains the gold standard for identifying causal effects, which is why it has long been used in clinical trials. Experimental economics has similarly used controlled trials to explore economic questions in lab-like environments. Although fully controlled trials are rarely feasible in the context of firm regulation, regulators may still seek opportunities to adopt similar approaches where possible. Policy randomization can result in unequal treatment among regulated entities. Still, society accepts randomization in high-stakes decisionsâsuch as the military draft, jury selection, and clinical trialsâwhen randomization is grounded in ex-ante fairness.41, 42 Governments have also used randomization to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs and the benefits of Medicare coverage.43 Credible evidence on policy effectiveness can require accepting some temporary inequities among regulated entities or individuals; this tradeoff may be justified when the resulting knowledge has the potential to substantially improve long-run outcomes. This does not mean that arbitrarily large inequities should be introduced solely for the sake of experimentation. Instead, the potential benefits of policy experimentation should be weighed against the potential costs associated with any resulting inequities. In general, policy randomization is more ex-ante justifiable when there is greater uncertainty about a policy's effects (including on the bottom line of regulated entities) and when the costs of unequal treatment are relatively low. Bank supervision is one area where policy randomization could be used to learn more. Given that appropriate baseline levels of supervision are in place, the incremental costs and benefits of different supervisory approaches could be studied through randomized assignment. For example, supervisors could test the efficacy of varying examination frequencies, team sizes and compositions, triggers for examinations, or areas of focus. Over time, such experimentation could help regulatory agencies allocate their limited resources more efficiently. The socially optimal scope of a regulation may not align with the scope that best enables evaluation of its effects. While employing a suboptimal scope for the sake of evaluation may involve some theoretical cost, there is generally little empirical evidence that current scopes of application are optimally efficient. Therefore, experimentation with regulatory scope may be feasible without demonstrable loss of efficiency at the outset. Even with greater use of randomization, pilot programs, tiering, and staggering, ex-post evaluation can be difficult for certain policies. As discussed earlier, the application of multiple regulatory requirements at the same threshold can challenge efforts to isolate individual effects. These challenges highlight the importance of designing policies with evaluation in mind: by embedding variation in implementation, improving opportunities for measurement, and reducing overlap across rules. Still, in practice, stakeholders may struggle to agree on a structure that is both legally defensible and cost-effective while also supporting rigorous ex-post analysis. When policies are implemented in ways that preclude meaningful evaluation, more fundamental concerns arise, including ethical ones. For example, Campbell (1969) argued, "To be truly scientific we must be able to experiment. We must be able to advocate without that excess of commitment that blinds us to reality testing." Similarly, Boruch (1975) warned that, "[A] failure to discover whether a program is effective is unethical. Insofar as a failure to obtain unequivocal data on effects then leads to decisions which are wrong and ultimately damaging, that failure may violate good standards of both social and professional ethics." Or as Karl Popper put it, "â¦ we make progress, if and only if, we are prepared to learn from our mistakes: to recognize our errors and to utilize them critically instead of persevering in them dogmatically." (Popper 1957). Careful examination of policy effects helps ensure that government decisions are responsible, accountable, and guided by evidence. Dual reporting Identifying the costs and benefits of rules requires more than clear identification of treatment and control groupsâit also depends on having good data, a concern sometimes overlooked in the rule making process. For example, the definitions of capital and risk-weighted assets have changed several times since the Dodd-Frank Act. Yet regulatory reporting typically requires firms to provide data only under the latest definitions, making it difficult to measure whether changes in reported capital or assets reflect changes in behavior or shifts in definitions. New rules can avoid this issue by requiring firms to report data using both old and new definitions for a limited time. This approach is similar to how banks report the value of securities under both mark-to-market and amortized cost valuations. Such parallel data proved invaluable in understanding the banking problems that emerged in March 2023, helping regulators identify banks with significant unrealized losses from interest rates changes that were not reflected in regulatory capital. Similarly, when revising questions in its Current Population Survey, the Census Bureau asks the old and new versions of a question to maintain consistency and data usability over time.44 Dual reporting can also be useful when the scope of a rule is being narrowed. Maintaining data from firms that were previously covered can help evaluate whether regulatory simplifications and burden reductions achieve their intended outcomes. Failing to collect overlapping data often creates problems. Famously, the Census Bureau changed its annual health insurance survey at the same time the Affordable Care Act was implemented, making it much harder to evaluate the law through ex-post analysis.45 Another example was the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 1994 introduction of the concept of discouraged workers and other major changes to the U-4 through U-6 unemployment measures.46 These changes made comparisons with earlier data more difficult and complicated analysis of laws such as the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Dual reporting would temporarily raise compliance costs. Still, when reporting under old definitions can rely on existing systems, the marginal costs may be low. In such cases, the potential benefits of dual reporting are likely to outweigh the costs. Effective ex-post evaluation of rules can offer substantial benefits. This paper outlines two rule design strategies to support such evaluation. First, expanding the use of tiering, randomization, and staggered implementation can improve the identification of a rule's effects by creating treatment and control groups. Table 1 illustrates several applications of these techniques in public policy, showcasing how they can yield insights across a range of settings. Second, dual-reporting requirementsâwhere both new and legacy data are collected during a transitional windowâhelp distinguish the true effects of rules from changes in measurement. In addition, analysts tasked with ex-post evaluation could be brought into the rulemaking process early to help identify ways to enable meaningful evaluation. Once designing rules for ex-post evaluation becomes standard practice, policymakers and researchers are likely to discover more tools to support it. With a broader toolkit, many more ex-post evaluations will become possible. Many have argued that policymakers may resist this approach, worrying they have more to lose by exposing poor performing policies than they have to gain from highlighting successful ones (Wolf, 1979; Hogwood and Gunn, 1984; Twight, 1991; Weiss, 1993; Rossi, 1987; Hanson, 2003; Prendergast, 2003; Prendergast, 2007; and Bovens, Hart, and Kuipers, 2009). Policymakers may also be concerned about the costs of ex-post evaluations or worry that designing for evaluation could slow down the rulemaking process, delaying public access to well-crafted policies. Still, the benefits of strengthening ex-post evaluation are worth serious consideration. The regulatory community has managed the discomforts of ex-ante impact analyses by normalizing them. Today, nearly every major rule includes such an analysis, offering valuable information to both policymakers and the public. Similarly, normalizing ex-post evaluation could reduce the stigma of admitting that some rules underperform, and in turn encourage more independent, timely, and accurate evaluations. Better ex-post evaluation would help the public understand the real impacts of government policyâand support reform or repeal of rules that fall short.

Two key laws here are the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to consider the impact of their rules on small entities. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act requires agencies to assess the costs and benefits of any regulation that has a material impact on state, local, or tribal governments. Both laws define agencies according to Title 5, Section 551(1) of the US Code; however, the Regulatory Flexibility Act includes independent regulatory agencies, while the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act excludes them. Return to text 3. See Executive Order No. 12866, 58 Federal Register 51735 (October 4, 1993) and Circular A-4: Regulatory Analysis, Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President (final-2003 and proposed-2023 versions). Return to text 4. Historically these requirements did not apply to independent regulatory agencies. However, recently issued Executive Order No. 14215, 90 Federal Register 10447 (February 24, 2025) mandates that "â¦all executive departments and agencies, including so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA)â¦" along with their cost-benefit analyses. OIRA traditionally reviews agency submissions of the potential costs and benefits of "significant" rules (Congressional Research Service, 2024). Return to text 5.

Alessandro, Cardinale, Lagomarsino, Scartascini, and Torrealday (2019) show that government transparency, and particularly transparency about government performance (e.g., implementing effective rules) promotes citizen confidence in government. In a metanalysis of 49 studies, Qiushi and Guan (2022) show that government transparency has a positive and significant effect on citizen trust in government. Return to text 14. See Herrick and Sarewitz (2000), Kovacic (2006), and de Jong et al. (2018) for a discussion of the benefits of ex-post evaluation of policies in the context of environmental policy, competition policy, and infrastructure projects, respectively. Return to text 15. The Department of Energy previously highlighted a related motivation, stating that it would "consider how regulations might be designed and written" to better support retrospective evaluation and measurement of outcomes (DOE 2011). Although DOE's subsequent actions regarding this specific goal are uncertain, our work explicitly advances this approach. Return to text 16. Even with this separation of drafting and analysis roles, both sets of analysts ultimately answer to SEC leadership. Skeptics could still justifiably worry about the analysts' independence when they have the same bosses. Return to text 17. The typical identification assumptions used in measuring the effects of regulations do not require that firms be "similar." Rather, the (partly non-testable) assumptions needed for causal identification are exchangeability (i.e., there is conditional mean independence of treatment and control units), positivity (i.e., the probability of a unit being treated is positive but below one), and stable unit treatment value (i.e., potential outcomes of each unit are unaffected by the treatment assignment of other units). Similarity of treated and control units is one way to satisfy these assumptions but is not necessary. A potential objection to using differentiated application of regulations to similar firms to identify treatment effects is that, by changing the conditions of competition across firms, introducing a regulation for a subset of firms can also affect outcomes for the non-treated firms â which would violate the stable unit treatment assumption. This is a potential limitation to consider when applying the identification methodologies discussed below. Return to text 18. Differentiated application of regulations is often mandated by statute. This article focuses on the ex-post evaluation of regulations issued by the executive branch agencies, but similar approaches can be followed by Congress to evaluate the effectiveness of statutes ex-post. Return to text 19. In the banking regulation context, regulations with thresholds of application abound (see Congressional Research Service (2017) for a listing of all the thresholds that were in place at that time). Several regulations include enhanced requirements for large firms, complex firms, or both, including capital, liquidity, and resolution requirements. Return to text 20. Large banking organizations tend to pose proportionally more systemic risk to the financial system than smaller banking organizations (see, for instance, Lorenc and Zhang (2020)). Return to text 21. Given the same regulatory requirements, a firm with $1 billion in activity may be able to use the same systemâand incur a similar absolute costâas a firm that performs $2 billion of the activity. Return to text 22. France imposes numerous regulations on firms once they employ 50 or more workers, resulting in an unusually high number of firms with exactly 49 employees. Such "bunching" has been estimated to reduce French aggregate productivity by 3.4 percent of gross domestic product (Garicano et al., 2016). Return to text 23. The Durbin amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the Federal Reserve to limit fees charged to retailers for credit card processing. Return to text 24. See, for example, Leonardi and Pica (2006) and Vaccro (2017). Return to text 25. For example, consider that the average domestic banking organization subject to Category III requirements had $550 billion in assets as of 2023:Q4. Given a typical return on assets of 1 percent, these banks would have to give up $3 billion in returns to be subject to Category IV requirements instead. Given observed growth in balance sheets, the current regulations have not caused banks to downsize in this way. Return to text 26. See Congressional Research Service (2017) and Labonte and Perkins (2017). The $50 billion threshold was generally increased to $250 billion in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018. Return to text 27.

See Federal Reserve System (2016) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2023). Return to text 29. The idea of using staggered implementation for causal identification has long been a standard practice in policy analysis (Meyer, 1995). The earliest reference we know of calling for expanded use of staggering to promote policy evaluation is Leuz and Wysocki (2016). Return to text 30. Between August 2000 and January 2001, the New York Stock Exchange, in a series of incremental steps, began trading and quoting all its listed securities in increments of a penny. See SEC (2000) for additional details. Return to text 31. The primary component of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 was a $100 billion program of economic stimulus using tax rebates. The IRS implementation of this stimulus was randomized based on the last two digits of the filer's Social Security number. See Parker et al. (2013) for details. Return to text 32. Chung et al. (2004) studied the staggered roll out of decimalization. The Nasdaq Stock Market and the New York Stock Exchange have also performed ex-post analyses of this policy. As predicted, these analyses found that decimal pricing reduced bid-ask spreads. There were concerns the rule would reduce market liquidity, but the analyses failed to find evidence that liquidity declined. Chung, Lee, and Rösch (2020) and Werner et al. (2022) look at a related policy experiment involving a stratified random sampling process that assigned different quote and trading price increments in 2016 called the tick size pilot program. Parker et al. (2013) studied the effect of the staggered IRS roll out of the economic stimulus payments of 2008. This paper helped establish the efficacy of fiscal stimulus spending, finding a marginal propensity to consume of 50 to 90 percent in the first three months after stimulus payments were received. These results imply that such payments are highly effective stimulus. Return to text 33. See Bessembinder et al. (2006) and Goldstein et al. (2007). Return to text 34. The 2024 CMS staffing rule for long-term care facilities phases in nurse staffing minimums across facilities at different times, based on geographic and facility-specific factors, allowing for future comparisons across rollout cohorts. Similarly, the Department of Labor's 2024 overtime rule raises salary thresholds in two steps, creating a time-based regression discontinuity that could support evaluation of labor market effects. To date, neither rule has been the subject of published ex-post evaluation exploiting this variation. Return to text 35. The CECL accounting standard was required for entities that meet the definition of an SEC filer as of January 2020, and all other entities were required to adopt CECL by January 2023 (see Financial Accounting Standards Board, 2016). Return to text 36. Stress tests were initially implemented for the largest 19 banks in 2009 (under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program) and later extended to all banks with more than $50 billion in total assets in 2013, following on the statuary mandate from the Dodd-Frank Act; see Board of Governors (2009, 2013). Return to text 37. In an implementation that combines staggering and tiering, the LCR was initially introduced for the largest firms in 2015:Q1, and, later, a modified LCR was applied to a set of smaller yet large firms starting in 2016:Q1 (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 2014). Return to text 38. This occasionally happens in medical trials where a treatment is so effective that the study is ended early over ethical concerns about denying potentially life-saving treatment to the control group. See Mueller, Montori, Bassler, Koenig, and Guyatt (2007) for a discussion of this issue. Return to text 39. See Harris et al.

The Mexican anti-poverty program Progresa/Oportunidades was designed for evaluation using a randomized design. The ongoing program provides cash transfers to poor families based on school attendance and doctor visits (Parker and Todd, 2017). Due to lack of available funds to cover all eligible citizens, Oregon randomized who was covered by a Medicaid expansion in 2008, giving important insights actual benefits of government health insurance (Allen et al, 2010; DeVoe et al, 2015). Return to text 44. The Census Bureau frequently asks multiple versions of a question when introducing a potential question to the American Community Survey. In addition, extensive effort typically goes into the revision of existing questions to validate when and if the new and old series are comparable. See Census Bureau (2020). Return to text 45.

Title: BMO Capital’s AV Expert: Tesla Remains “Significantly Behind” Waymo

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. While Tesla has done its best to create a relentless hype cycle around its just-launched robotaxis, with a curated bunch of Tesla-supporting influencers receiving the first invites to test the service, and their ensuing flowery reports playing an important role in supporting Tesla's share price, the reality is much more nuanced, and lies somewhere in the middle of the sunny optimism emanating from the EV giant's quarters and the literal death knells that its opponents are sounding with an alarming frequency. Now, BMO Capital's Autonomous Vehicle (AV) expert has chimed in with a less-than-flattering view of the performance of Tesla's robotaxis over the past few days. BMO Capital's AV Expert: 'Waymo Is Miles Ahead’ We hosted an autonomous vehicle (AV) expert who previously worked at Waymo and now collaborates with policymakers to advance the AV industry. Our expert suggested that the industry is in the early innings of its commercialization… — Kaushik (@BigBullCap) June 26, 2025 To wit, BMO Capital has now disclosed in its latest note that it recently hosted an AV expert who had previously worked at Waymo and currently advises governments on advancing the AV industry. While conceding that the industry was still in the "early innings" of the ongoing commercialization race, this expert boldly pronounced that Waymo was "miles ahead of the AV competition," ranking Chinese players - Baidu and Pony.ai - as distant seconds, followed by Amazon's Zoox and May Mobility. Critically, according to the AV expert, Tesla remained "significantly behind" Waymo in the rapidly heating AV commercialization race. The expert then points out that a typical driver associated with a given ride-share service undertakes between 15 and 20 rides per day. This contrasts sharply with Waymo's current cadence of between 20 and 25 rides per day. To unlock the economies of scale, however, Waymo will have to scale to 50 rides per day per vehicle, according to this expert. As a refresher, Waymo currently operates an autonomous ride-hailing service in 5 US cities via a fleet of around 1,500 Jaguar I-Pace vehicles, with each such vehicle equipped with an expensive array of sensors, including LiDAR, 360-degree view cameras, and a radar, all feeding into onboard compute resources. On the other hand, Tesla's robotaxis leverage an interconnected neural network along with cameras that are supposedly capable of counting individual photons, although some experts doubt that these cameras are capable of such a feat. Coming back, BMO Capital's AV expert concedes that the expensive LiDAR sensors, which are critical for depth perception, currently remain "a key cost constraint to scaling AVs." The expert asserts that Tesla would be at a distinct advantage if its camera-based, vision-only AV solution were to ultimately prove as effective as Waymo's multiple sensors-based approach. After only 4 days, Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin has already logged one incident of "Safety Concern", giving it a rate of 0.25/day so far. Waymo has 22 Safety Concern incidents since testing began 359 days ago (0.06/day) & 14 since service began in March (0.12/day).$TSLA pic.twitter.com/LryAHvLToX — Motorhead (@BradMunchen) June 26, 2025 We noted in a previous post that the NHTSA has now reportedly contacted Tesla after various videos recently surfaced, showing robotaxis committing various traffic violations, which include failure to adhere to lane discipline as well as speed limit violations. For context, do note that Waymo has logged fewer critical errors over its 10 million completed miles than Tesla has over the past few days, and that too, with a fleet of just 11 robotaxis operating in a geofenced area of Austin, replete with an employee stationed in the front passenger seat and supported by a dedicated team of teleoperators, who are mandated to take over in case of an emergency! Of course, despite all the hype surrounding Tesla's FSD, it is still widely considered a Level 2 autonomous driving system, as opposed to Waymo's, which is classified as a Level 4 system. Not everything is doom and gloom around Tesla, however. For one, the brokerage firm Benchmark has just hiked its target for Tesla shares from $350 to $475, citing the EV giant's demonstration of a "controlled and safety-first approach" to its robotaxis, which can speed up the regulatory approval process. Benchmark goes on to note: "We are a believer in TSLA’s camera-focused approach that is not only cost effective but also scalable." Do note that Tesla has given up the entirety of this week's gains, and is currently trading flat on a 5-day basis. Over the past month, the stock is down around 10 percent.

Title: College graduates face toughest job market in more than a decade as hiring slows

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn’t found a job in the industry that surrounds her. “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration’s tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artifical intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government’s monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came. “Nobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,” Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. “My resume is full, there’s no gaps or anything. Every summer I’m doing something. It’s just, ‘OK, so what else are you looking for?’” She has returned to Clark for a master’s program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She’s hopeful it will lead to a job next year. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company’s corporate work force over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Zahid worries that AI is hurting her chances. She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, “Why hire a human when you could use AI?” Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology. Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn’t, said Kory Kantenga, the firm’s head of economics for the Americas. “We don’t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,” Kantenga said. He added that the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes have also slowed hiring in tech. Many IT firms expanded when the Fed pinned its short-term rate at nearly zero after the pandemic. In 2022, the Fed began cranking up rates to combat inflation, which made it harder to borrow and grow. In fact, IT’s hiring spree when rates were low — fueled by millions of Americans ramping up their online shopping and video conferencing — left many firms with too many workers, economists say. Cory Stahle, an economist at the job-listings website Indeed, says postings for software development jobs, for example, have fallen 40% compared with four years ago. It’s a sharp shift for students who began studying computer science when hiring was near its peak. Zahid, who lives in Dublin, California, has experienced this whiplash firsthand. When she entered college in 2019, her father, who is a network engineer, encouraged her to study IT and said it would be easy for her to get a job in the field. She initially studied psychology but decided she wanted something more hands-on and gravitated to data analysis. Her husband, 33, has a software development job, and friends of hers in IT received immediate job offers upon graduation a few years ago. Such rapid hiring seems to have disappeared now, she said. She has her college diploma, but hasn’t hung it up yet. “I will put it up when I actually get a job, confirming that it was worth it all,” she said.

Title: College graduates face toughest job market in more than a decade as hiring slows

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn’t found a job in the industry that surrounds her. “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration’s tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artifical intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government’s monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came. “Nobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,” Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. “My resume is full, there’s no gaps or anything. Every summer I’m doing something. It’s just, ‘OK, so what else are you looking for?’” She has returned to Clark for a master’s program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She’s hopeful it will lead to a job next year. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company’s corporate work force over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Zahid worries that AI is hurting her chances. She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, “Why hire a human when you could use AI?” Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology. Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn’t, said Kory Kantenga, the firm’s head of economics for the Americas. “We don’t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,” Kantenga said.

How many leather jackets can this amount of money buy? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The leather jacket-toting CEO sold 100,000 Nvidia shares last Friday and Monday, marking the start of a planned sale of up to six million shares announced in March of this year. The company’s stock price around that time hovered at $144.56 per share, meaning Mr. Huang just made nearly $15 million over the weekend. Nvidia recently hit a record stock price of $154.31, so the total sale, if the company’s stock price holds, is potentially valued at almost a billion dollars — $925,429,000 to be exact. Despite that massive amount, it is but a drop in the bucket as his estimated net worth is $135 billion, says CNBC, putting him at number 10 on the Forbes list of the world’s richest people (at least at the time of writing). This sale was planned months earlier with the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which helps avoid corporate insiders from being accused of insider trading. Huang’s timing is impeccable, though, as his stock sale started execution just as Nvidia’s value hit record highs. This also isn’t the first time that Nvidia’s C-suite has executed an 10b5-1 plan and benefited from its sky-high stock prices. Just last year, its executives and directors sold over $1.8 billion in Nvidia stock, with Jensen raking in $713 million in cash after selling six million shares — the same amount planned for this year. Despite those sales figures, Jensen still owns a substantial amount of Nvidia. According to the SEC filing, he still has over 75 million shares in his direct ownership, plus another 783,375,400 shares owned indirectly through trusts and LLCs. Aside from that, he also received $49.9 million last year in total compensation, which was higher than the $44 million he received in 2023. Nvidia’s massive growth happened within the last couple of years, when the AI boom propelled its stock price to the stratosphere. Its stock price hovered around $5 in the late 2010s, before jumping to around $25 to $30 in 2021 due to the GPU shortages. It dropped back down to $15 in late 2022 before skyrocketing in the years after that due to AI advancements. By late 2024, Nvidia overtook Apple as the world’s most valuable company, making it worth more than Amazon and Meta combined.

Title: 4 Popular Dividends For The Geopolitical Conflicts Unfolding Now

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Military Mission at twilight Let’s talk about oil and gold dividends. Whether or not the new peace in the Middle East holds, there are some high-quality dividends worth owning anytime. These generous payers (up to 8%) provide peace of mind just in case the geopolitical Jenga set gets knocked loose again. We’ll start with crude, which had rallied to one-year highs. I was originally going to advise not chasing the Strait of Hormuz oil rally. Futures indicated (and still do) that lower prices are likely ahead. January 2026 still trades cheaper—suggesting temporary disruption at worst. Back at home, you’ve probably heard (not least from me, often) that President Donald Trump wants a lower fed funds rate To achieve this, he and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are targeting lower oil (“drill baby, drill”) so that inflation continues to cool and the Fed can ease. Given policymakers’ penchant for deregulation and drilling, it’s best to sidestep the producers here. We have done well owning Exxon Mobil (XOM) in the past but the time to buy the stock is when oil prices are likely to rise. Exxon has grinded sideways since we sold it from our Contrarian Income Report portfolio. Let’s consider Kinder Morgan (KMI) and its 4.2% yield instead. Kinder funds its dividend by “collecting tolls” on its 79,000 miles of pipelines. Crude oil and most notably natural gas flow through Kinder’s North America pipelines. As long as energy moves, the cash flows. A huge 40% of U.S. natural gas flows through Kinder’s systems to 139 company-owned terminals storing petroleum products, chemicals and renewables. With market share like this, Kinder can raise its pricing regularly and therefore boost dividends often too. When the company was founded back in 1997 (or “back in the 1900s” as my kids say) by Richard Kinder and William Morgan, they structured it as a master limited partnership. MLPs issue K-1 forms at tax time, which can be a bit of a headache. Instead of forcing shareholders into a lifetime of tax-time headaches, Kinder converted into a simpler corporation in 2014. Corporations issue a traditional 1099, which is easier for accountants and users of tax software. This move made Kinder more popular and awarded it a perennially higher valuation. For those of us who prefer lower valuations (and higher yields), Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP) is an elite 8% dividend play. Alerian buys MLPs and packages them into one fund, consolidating messy K-1s into a neat 1099 at tax time—a “cheat code” for easy 8% energy dividends. These are salad days for Alerian, too. The fund has raised its dividend for three straight quarters! AMLP Dividend Let’s move on to gold, the “barbarous relic” that investors buy when they feel nervous. We contrarians are bullish because: Creditors will be paid back, because the U.S. owns the global printing press. But they will ultimately receive depreciated dollars due to some “monetization” of this massive debt load. The U.S. dollar is already eroding, falling 28% versus gold year-to-date — 28%! A shiny sign of capital flowing into assets immune to central bank printing. VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) is a one-click way to play higher gold and lower oil prices. Energy is the main cost input for gold miners. Profit margins will expand from here if gold stays high and oil slumps. A high-quality discounted alternative is GAMCO Global Gold, Natural Resources & Income Trust (GGN), a closed-end fund trading at a 2% discount to its net asset value. About half of the fund’s portfolio sits in mining stocks—both gold and non-gold plays like iron miner Rio Tinto (RIO). Thanks to the deal we can snag these stocks for 98 cents on the dollar. GGN pays a steady 3-cent monthly dividend (8% annualized), giving investors income stability with upside potential. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

June 26, 2025 08:36 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Bitcoin and crypto have rocketed higher over the last year, surging along with stock markets despite fears of a “Doomsday” scenario for the markets and the bitcoin price. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has soared back toward its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, up around 50% from its April lows and helped by U.S. president Donald Trump surprising traders with a “massive” crypto prediction. Now, as the crypto market braces for a Congress game-changer predicted to “unleash” trillions, a legendary billionaire has said he expects global “de-dollarization" to catapult the bitcoin price to a $5 trillion market capitalization by 2030—putting it alongside technology giants Nvidia and Microsoft. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run The "de-dollarisation of the world [and] the end of U.S. exceptionalism" has been named as the ... More driving force behind a huge $5 trillion bitcoin price prediction. Philippe Laffont, the billionaire founder of hedge fund Coatue Management, has added bitcoin to his Fantastic 40 list, a collection of investments he thinks will be the biggest winners over the next five years. Laffont’s list, which features Microsoft, Nvidia, bitcoin, Amazon and Meta as the top five and doesn't include tech giants Apple or Google at all, can be seen in full here. "I wake up every day at three in the morning and I’m like, ‘why am I such an idiot? What have I been waiting for, not being involved in [bitcoin]?' And it just goes up and up," Laffont told CNBC, adding that, “sometimes you have to change your mind and you have to say, well, 'I made a mistake.'” According to Laffont, who claims he hasn't bought bitcoin yet, its price could more than double to give bitcoin a market capitalization of over $5 trillion by 2030, with Microsoft forecast to soar to $5.7 trillion and Nvidia to $5.6 trillion. "I always thought, bitcoin's amazing, but it's double or triple the volatility of the Nasdaq," Laffont said. "It seems its volatility as an asset class is coming down."

Laffont pointed to the gold's $22 trillion market cap as justification for bitcoin's performance over the next few years, along with "the de-dollarisation of the world [and] the end of U.S. exceptionalism." The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the value of the dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, has declined 10% year-to-date, hit by growing fears over the $37 trillion U.S. debt pile and that inflation, which spiraled out of control in the aftermath of Covid-era money printing and lockdowns, could return. Earlier this month Jim Esposito, the president of market maker Citadel Securities, called U.S. debt a “ticking time bomb” as it revealed plans to ramp up its bitcoin and crypto trading.

(Photo Illustration by Algi Febri Sugita/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Advanced Micro Devices stock (NASDAQ:AMD) rose nearly 7% during Tuesday trading and approximately 15% year-to-date, as investor confidence grows regarding its role in the AI chip market, with several analysts raising their price targets for the stock. So what exactly has shifted for AMD in recent months? The AI semiconductor industry is vast and continues to grow rapidly. Nvidia has a stronghold in the market and has more than doubled its revenue over the last two years, with the data center GPU market exceeding $100 billion annually. However, AMD does not need to surpass Nvidia to further enhance its stock—it simply needs to increase GPU sales, and an opportunity may be emerging. In the past three years, the AI market has been characterized by significant investments from major tech companies and hyperscalers aiming to create the most advanced frontier AI models. These organizations have focused on performance and training speed, as training large language models necessitates substantial computational resources. This trend has favored Nvidia, which produces the leading chips available and possesses a well-established hardware and software ecosystem among major cloud service providers. Nonetheless, there is a genuine possibility that the rapid enhancements in frontier AI models will eventually reach a plateau. A broader array of AI workloads will transition to inference—essentially applying the developed models to real-world scenarios—where efficiency and cost are more critical than sheer computing power. This situation could represent a chance for AMD. Not all organizations require or can afford Nvidia’s premium GPUs. Many may choose older Nvidia models or more budget-friendly alternatives like AMD’s MI series, which provide adequate memory and solid performance for inference and fine-tuning of models. Additionally, open-source models like Llama from Meta may enable more companies to run their AI workloads on-site, decreasing dependence on costly cloud computing fees. This could also benefit AMD. Meanwhile, Intel is attempting to stage a comeback Can Intel’s 18A Break TSMC’s 2nm Stronghold? At its AI Day event, AMD introduced its MI350 series, set to launch in the second half of 2025, which it claims will deliver four times the AI compute capacity of its predecessor. The company also provided a preview of its MI400 and MI450 chips, furthering its evolving product strategy. Beyond hardware, AMD is developing its AI software and systems stack, positioning itself as a comprehensive AI provider—through its acquisitions of Brium, focused on compiler and AI software optimization, and Enosemi, specializing in silicon photonics. These strategies could also bolster AMD’s ROCm software stack, which follows an open-source, standards-based methodology, contrasting with Nvidia’s proprietary CUDA environment. This could attract enterprises seeking flexibility and lower costs for large-scale AI deployment. AMD recently announced a partnership with Oracle to make its MI355X GPUs available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, offering over two times the price-performance advantage compared to previous generations for large-scale AI tasks including inferencing. Nevertheless, risks persist. Cloud providers such as Google and Amazon are developing their own custom AI chips, which could restrict long-term demand for third-party hardware solutions. Nvidia may also intensify focus on more efficient mid-tier chips as the market shifts toward inferencing. Refer to our analysis on AMD Valuation: Is AMD Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for additional insights regarding AMD’s valuation and its comparison with competitors. The significant rise in AMD stock may restrict its potential in the near to medium term. Alternatively, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), has produced impressive returns for investors.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Micron Technology shares rose 2 per cent in premarket trading on Thursday, after a robust forecast from the chipmaker for fourth-quarter revenue on booming demand for its memory chips that power AI data centers. The company saw a nearly 50 per cent jump in sales of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips for the third quarter compared to the previous three months. Micron is one of the providers of HBM chips besides South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung "AI servers are giving Micron an over-caffeinated growth spurt... (and) Micron is the only kid on the block shipping HBM3E at scale," said Michael Ashley Schulman, partner at Running Point Capital Advisors. Micron said it will continue to invest in HBM chips which reflects the growing demand from AI chip front runners - Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, who are customers of the company.

by Mike June 26, 2025 Get ready to cringe and laugh as we unveil the tales of 40 people who received gifts at work that were more bewildering than wonderful. From thoughtlessly re-gifted items to presents that made them question their colleagues’ sanity, these stories of disappointing and downright rude gifts are a hilarious reminder that sometimes, it’s truly the thought that counts (or the lack thereof). Imagine unwrapping a box of expired chocolates, or finding a regifted pen with someone else’s name on it â these are just a sneak peek of the gift-giving blunders waiting inside. So, grab your popcorn and prepare for a journey through the wacky world of workplace gifting gone wrong. You’ll either be grateful for your considerate coworkers or find solace knowing you’re not alone in the office gift-giving Hall of Shame! My momâs boss gave everyone a pen (a really cr*ppy, normal pen) with their names printed on normal white printer paper that was scotch taped down the side of the pen. This sounds made up even to me as I type it, but itâs still in our junk drawer. A small, nickel-sized, heart-shaped rock sent in the mail. It was supposed to represent their appreciation for the extra work during Covid. All I could think of was Charlie Brown trick or treating, âI got a rock.â Not me, but one year the company my brother works for gave each employee a CD of the owner playing Christmas songs on the harmonica. A letter from the CEO telling us how he is going to celebrate Christmas with his family up north to go skiing. That was all. Two free tickets to a cinema. The issue was that the closest cinema in that particular chain was about 800 miles away from me. That year the company decided it wasnât going to provide basic office supplies for the break room. Coffee, tea, eating utensils, napkins, nothing. That year for Christmas we all got a brown paper bags fashioned like lunches. Inside was a metal straw, cloth napkin, a child sized set of plastic cutlery that fit in a travel case, a copy paste printed piece of paper with food puns in relation to our job, and a single fun sized hundred grand candy bar. This Fortune 500 company had over a billion in raw profit that year. Oh, and the cutlery ended up getting recalled due to some terrible forever chemicals in them. An email that only upper management would be getting the end of year bonus (sent to entire company by accident instead of just upper management). Then laid off 2 weeks into the new year. Found out from a friend in the company a little while later that the board of directors held a vote. They keep their car allowances at the expense of a wave of layoffs, or lose their car allowances and 10-15 people get to keep their jobs. Pretty sure it was unanimous. No matter how many times a company says youâre family, just remember that itâs the type of family that would gladly cut your throat to make sure the fat cats get to eat. – strike-when-ready Noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones. I’m sure they were good and useful to some people, but I’m legally deaf. We were told we were receiving our Christmas bonuses soon, and then we were all given a poinsettia. The poinsettia in itself wasnât so bad, mine is actually still alive years later, but the fact that they had the audacity to call it a bonus was absurd. Jelly of the Month membership instead of my Christmas bonus. I wanted to put a pool in the backyard but nope. – inkyblinkypinkysue I was gifted a ham for the holidaysâ¦..Iâm Jewish. Not me but a friend – all staff at the hospital received a kitchen scrubby for Christmas. Not even themed. Just random browns, greens, pinks, and yellows… seems like the boss bought dollar store multi-packs and opened them to give everyone one piece. Nurses Week 2022 (height of Delta wave COVID). We were given rocks on a keychain. The rock was engraved with the word âHopeâ. We might have gotten some chapstick too. New owners this year. Old owner gave us 10% of our salary as a year end bonus. New guys gave us $100 amazon cards that were drained by the time we got them. Everyone was pissed but didn’t wanna say anything so I did. He asked everyone and they claimed to be delighted with their cards. Spineless bastards. Lmao. – dankasaurus710 Company coffee mug with the company name misspelled. It was a large company. Teacher here. One year, as our Christmas bonus, we got a defective plastic keychain that read “I love teching!” Spelled exactly like that. Normally, I’m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.. but after the s**t we had been through, with zero support from admin, s**t pay, disrespect, etc. the keychain set us all off. It was adding insult to injury. Like, not only is our “bonus” a keychain that didn’t even work (the hasp had no spring), but the spelling error meant that a) someone didn’t even check them when they arrived, and b) someone put them in every teacher mailbox without looking at them. Admin sent out an email that basically said turn your keychains back in so they could send them back and get corrected ones. So, adding insult to injury. I appreciated the sentiment, but all of us could’ve done without that. An ultra-religious self-help book so we could become less miserable, incompetent and immoral. During the pandemic, my partnerâs company sent employees each an envelope through the mail with a sticker in it for some appreciation week I laughed so hard at that. It literally was a sticker that said âhappy appreciation weekâ. A coin commemorating a billion dollars in sales. I was re-gifted a gift basket given to my boss by a client and he forgot to remove the card that was addressed to him. Starbucks gift card that had no money on it and they had no receipt for it. Not me but a coworker at last year’s raffle got a Nintendo DS cleaning kit. For a normal Nintendo DS, not even a 3DS. They aren’t being made anymore. A pack of 10 tissues at the onset of COVID. Expired food. My last job the company broke all sorts of financial records and gave everyone a very expensive glass thing with a decal of the refinery. Not only did it suck but all employees ended having to pay 75 dollars in taxes on it. So the ‘job well done’ cost 75 bucks. – Logic_rocks I used to work in a record shop in the UK and usually got a bottle of wine as a Christmas bonus. Then the company was bought by Virgin and our Christmas bonus was a copy of Richard Branson’s (Virgin’s CEO) autobiography. 5 dollar Subway gift card. My boss made me come in on an off day to pick up because, âshe did not want me missing the company bonusâ. I really wonder if our managers need how much was on the cards? We talked about it for months. A long sleeve denim shirt with the company logo in the front above one of the front pockets.. In Florida. Plus we couldnât wear denim at work so the only time weâd be able to wear the company shirt is on our own time (not happening) or when weâd have dress down day (again not happening). When a coworker inquired where we could wear this since we canât wear it to work they listed places (like a BBQ joint, the movies, etc.) and said we should be grateful since most places donât give their employees gifts. It was a call center. Couldâve given a blanket (since it was cold in the center), travel mug, anything except a shirt we canât wear. – jennabellie A compulsory invitation to the holiday party. Technically, I wasn’t required to attend but it was a career-killer if you didn’t. I had to spend money on a dress just for the party since I didn’t have anything that was suitable, so not only did it cost *me* money, but I had to spend a precious evening pretending I liked my coworkers. – Particular-Natural12 A pink slip. And I don’t mean lingerie. TableAssault: A pink slip (in the US anyway) can be a notice of termination of employment or the title to a vehicle. Iâm guessing OP didnât get a new car as a gift, soâ¦ got fired. – ElvinBishop A cheap plastic key ring with the company logo on it after working 16-hour days for months to win a massive contract. No overtime paid either. An email from the boss saying he is donating “on behalf of the company” to a charity he is a chairman of. At a company Christmas party they would raffle off prizes; one prize for each person. They guy in front of me won a Budweiser mini fridge with LED lights. The guy after me won a LG flat-screen TV. My prize? A Pepsi baseball hat with broken snaps. – startinearly The first company I worked for out of college gave everyone a âfree turkeyâ around the holidays. It wasnât really a free turkey, it was a $25 gift certificate to a grocery store that was inconvenient for 75% of the people working there. And $25 didnât cover a turkey, of course. Turns out, the company owners had a stake in the store. – truthcopy A bottle of our restaurantâs âsignatureâ steak sauce that no one really liked and that we all had free access to all day, every day at work. This was instead of the standard $100 cash bonus we normally got yearly. – LadyLixerwyfe Welcome back in office postcard after the pandemic work from home period. Weâve got it minutes after receiving termination letters. Like I was fully expecting it but still it was in a poor taste. – jivow Nothing. And I work for a giant company. Not surprised though. The MD of the company bought himself a boat âfor the companyâ. We didnât get a bonus that year. – Thisoneissfwihope Worked for FritoLay.

Title: College graduates face toughest job market in more than a decade as hiring slows
URL: https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/college-graduates-face-toughest-job-market-decade-hiring-123221189

Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade WASHINGTON -- While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn't found a job in the industry that surrounds her. “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artificial intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government's monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came. “Nobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,” Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. "My resume is full, there’s no gaps or anything. Every summer I’m doing something. It’s just, ‘OK, so what else are you looking for?’” She has returned to Clark for a master's program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She's hopeful it will lead to a job next year. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company's corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Zahid worries that AI is hurting her chances. She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, “Why hire a human when you could use AI?” Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology. Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn't, said Kory Kantenga, the firm's head of economics for the Americas. “We don’t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,” Kantenga said. He added that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have also slowed hiring in tech. Many IT firms expanded when the Fed pinned its short-term rate at nearly zero after the pandemic. In 2022, the Fed began cranking up rates to combat inflation, which made it harder to borrow and grow. In fact, IT's hiring spree when rates were low — fueled by millions of Americans ramping up their online shopping and video conferencing — left many firms with too many workers, economists say. Cory Stahle, an economist at the job-listings website Indeed, says postings for software development jobs, for example, have fallen 40% compared with four years ago. It's a sharp shift for students who began studying computer science when hiring was near its peak. Zahid, who lives in Dublin, California, has experienced this whiplash firsthand. When she entered college in 2019, her father, who is a network engineer, encouraged her to study IT and said it would be easy for her to get a job in the field. She initially studied psychology but decided she wanted something more hands-on and gravitated to data analysis. Her husband, 33, has a software development job, and friends of hers in IT received immediate job offers upon graduation a few years ago. Such rapid hiring seems to have disappeared now, she said. She has her college diploma, but hasn't hung it up yet. “I will put it up when I actually get a job, confirming that it was worth it all,” she said. ___ AP Writer Matt Sedensky in New York contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

The market is expected to rise further, reaching $9.52 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 6.18% and projecting continued growth to $12.42 billion by 2034 with a CAGR of 5.46%. Historically, growth drivers included aerospace expansion, increased demand for cold chain logistics, and governmental policy support. However, the market faced challenges from stringent insulation material regulations. Looking forward, the market is poised to benefit from rising LNG demand, expanding industrial gas applications, and clean energy initiatives, although high initial investment costs and supply chain disruptions could pose challenges. In 2024, Asia-Pacific dominated the cryogenic insulation market, contributing $2.87 billion (40.67%) of the total. Continued growth is anticipated in Asia-Pacific and Western Europe, with CAGRs of 7.47% and 6.09% respectively. Other promising markets include the Middle East and South America, expected to grow at CAGRs of 5.78% and 5.45% respectively. The market landscape remains fragmented, with the top ten competitors holding a combined 24.15% share in 2023. BASF SE led the sector with a 3.57% market share, closely followed by players like Armacell International Holding GmbH and Lydall Inc. Product segmentation includes cellular, fibrous, flake, granular, reflective, and other types, with cellular being the largest segment (50.73% in 2024) and reflective expected to show the fastest growth (CAGR of 7.90% from 2024 to 2029). In terms of application, storage tanks represented the largest segment (36.75% in 2024), while the terminals segment promises rapid growth (CAGR 6.96%). The energy and power industry remains the primary end-use sector, with the anticipated accelerated growth at a CAGR of 7.25% by 2029. Significant opportunities exist across segments, particularly in the cellular market (projected $1.3 billion gain by 2029) and storage tanks ($1.0 billion). The energy segment alone could see a $1.14 billion increase by 2029. Notably, China is poised to gain $606.38 million within the sector. Strategic approaches for market players include developing partnerships to enhance innovation, advancing hydrogen storage solutions, and launching high-performance insulation panels. Companies are advised to implement pricing strategies, expand digitally, and leverage partnerships for added value.

Title: How Amazon, Duolingo, Spotify, and Others Say AI Will Reshape Staffing
URL: https://www.adweek.com/media/amazon-duolingo-spotify-ai-reshape-staffing/
Time Published: 2025-06-26T07:02:23Z
Full Content:
Tech companies once blamed layoffs on overhiring and market shifts—now it’s AI. Recent statements from firms like Amazon, Shopify, British Telecom, Duolingo, and Klarna suggest that automation is reducing demand for human workers. As these companies pour heavily into AI, they’re simultaneously streamlining costs mostly through layoffs. In 2024, 549 tech firms laid off approximately 152,000 employees, according to Layoffs.fyi. At the same time, many CEOs are championing “AI-first” strategies and touting productivity gains. But the workforce may not be ready, with only 62% of employees having received any AI-related training, even as companies push to scale AI across their operations, according to Gartner. “We’re at this moment where making big statements is about getting attention and drawing focus to the fact that AI is being used for real business impact,” Gartner vp analyst Nicole Greene told ADWEEK. “Rather than the tangible, long-term conversation around what does it really look like to re-skill and up-skill talent for a modern workforce.” Former Publicis chief strategist and growth officer Rishad Tobaccowala said the shift is also about rebalancing power. Companies may need 20% to 25% fewer people for the same output, he said, but that future will rely on a new kind of worker, one who can collaborate with AI. “People are talking about AI strategy… that’s the stupidest thing in the world,” he said. “You need to figure out how your entire strategy is changed because of AI.” Here’s what company leaders have said publicly about how they believe AI will impact their workforce, in alphabetical order. Amazon Action: Since 2022, Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 employees across multiple divisions. While the company initially cited macroeconomic uncertainty, recent statements from leadership suggest AI is becoming a key factor in how it envisions future staffing. What it said: In a June blog post, CEO Andy Jassy pointed to the company’s deep investment in generative AI—highlighting over 1,000 services and applications in progress—and signaled a shift in how work gets done. “As we roll out more generative AI and agents,” he wrote, “it should change the way our work is done… [and] we’ll need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” While Jassy didn’t specify which roles would be affected, he noted that the company expects to see workforce reductions in the coming years as it leans into AI-driven efficiency. Jassy also pointed to advertising as a clear example of AI integration, citing Amazon’s suite of tools that help brands plan, onboard, create, and optimize campaigns, used by over 50,000 advertisers in Q1. British Telecom Action: British Telecom plans to cut 55,000 jobs by 2030, roughly 40% of its 130,000-person workforce. Of those, at least 10,000 roles could be replaced by AI, according to The Financial Times. What it said: CEO Allison Kirkby told FT the company is exploring the full impact of AI and suggested that, “depending on what we learn from AI … there may be an opportunity for BT to be even smaller by the end of the decade.” The company has already begun integrating generative AI into customer-facing roles, including sales and support operations. Duolingo Action: Cut around 10% of its contractor workforce in 2023, as it turns to AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 to streamline content production and translations. What it said: CEO Luis von Ahn has positioned the company as “AI-first,” saying that achieving that vision means rethinking “much of how we work,” and “making minor tweaks to systems designed for humans won’t get us there.” As part of the shift, Duolingo is placing “constructive constraints” on hiring: headcount will only be approved if a team “cannot automate more of their work.” The company is also experimenting with AI in hiring and performance reviews. Klarna Action: Klarna has reduced its workforce by about 40%, with CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski telling CNBC in May that the cuts are largely due to AI. The Swedish fintech company previously said it planned to shrink its headcount from 3,800 to 2,000 employees over the next few years. The company posted a $99 million loss in Q1, attributing it to one-off costs related to depreciation, share-based payments, and restructuring. What it said: In marketing specifically, CMO David Sandström told ADWEEK that team size reductions were driven in part by the growing capabilities of generative AI, and that further cuts could follow as the technology evolves. Shopify Action: Shopify has trimmed its workforce in the last two years, first by 14% in 2022, followed by another 20% in 2023. The company ended 2024 with 8,100 employees, down from 8,300 the previous year, per the company’s filing. What it said: In a memo to employees, which CEO Tobi Lütke posted on X, Shopify laid out a new baseline: “Reflexive AI usage,” in other words, all staffers tinkering with AI, is now expected across the company. Teams requesting headcount must first explain why the work can’t be done with AI. “What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?” Lütke wrote. The company also said it plans to add AI-related questions to its performance and peer review processes. Trishla is an Adweek staff reporter covering tech policy.

Title: Will AI really shrink workforces as Amazon boss says?

Andy Jassy is not the first executive to warn about the broader adoption of artificial intelligence and how it will fundamentally reshape the workforce. Are the doomsayers right? Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently announced that his company would reduce its workforce as artificial intelligence (AI) replaces human employees. He also warned that AI will affect a wide range of jobs and sectors. Jassy is not alone, as many other tech firms have issued similar warnings about how AI breakthroughs could reshape their workforce. In May, the CEO of the AI startup Anthropic told the Arlington, Virginia-based American news website Axios that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five years. US public companies have reduced the number of their white-collar staff by a collective 3.5% over the past three years, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing employment data provider Live Data Technologies. Over the past decade, one in five companies in the S&P 500 have shrunk, it said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Several tech companies, including Microsoft, Hewlett Packard and Procter & Gamble, have announced layoffs of thousands of workers over the past several months. Recently, retail service provider Shopify said teams requesting additional staff would first need to prove that AI could not perform the tasks. Duolingo, a language-learning app, also plans to gradually replace its external workers with AI. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has estimated that a quarter of jobs worldwide are at a high risk of being replaced by AI automation. But AI is also expected to create new opportunities and boost productivity. A report by the World Economic Forum earlier this year forecast that technological transformation would displace about 92 million existing jobs by 2030, while creating 170 million new ones. Jobs in developed economies will likely be more affected by AI than those in developing ones. A study published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last year found that the technology could affect 60% of jobs in developed economies — around half of them negatively, while the other half will see a positive impact. The report concluded that about 40% of jobs in emerging markets and 26% of jobs in low-income countries would be hit. But while these labor markets may see a smaller initial impact from AI, they are also less likely to benefit from the increased productivity that AI promises. During past technological breakthroughs, lower-skilled and blue-collar workers bore the brunt, such as workers on factory floors being replaced by robots. However, broad AI adoption is expected to hit higher-educated, white-collar workers hard, particularly those with tasks that AI could perform at a similar or better quality than a human worker. A study conducted by the Pew Research Center in the US found that occupations involving information gathering and data analysis, such as web developers, technical writers, accountants and data entry workers, among others, would be at high risk of being replaced by AI. Labor-intensive jobs that can't be easily automated, like construction workers, child care workers and firefighters, are expected to remain the most resilient. The possibility of massive job losses has triggered concerns over the disruptive effects of AI on employment and society, drawing the attention of politicians and even religious leaders. Pope Leo XIV, who became the head of the Catholic Church in May, has warned of the threat posed by AI to jobs and human dignity. Labor market expert Enzo Weber from the Institute of Employment Research in Nuremberg, Germany, believes the concerns over job losses are misplaced. Speaking with DW, he said AI advancements open up a wide range of economic possibilities and are more likely to help workers than cause mass unemployment. "AI primarily changes work, but it does not fundamentally eliminate it," said Weber, adding that the technology in most cases helps human workers "develop new tasks and perform their tasks better rather than just replacing them." A paper published in January by Harvard economists David Deming, Christopher Ong and Lawrence H. Summers shared a similar view. The economists argued that the automation of individual job tasks "does not necessarily reduce employment" and may even lead to "job gains in some sectors" of the economy. "In principle, being able to automate a previously onerous task could make workers so much more productive that the increased output offsets the fact that some of their work is now being done by a machine," they stated in the paper. Stressing that the impact of AI is likely to be "widespread and long-lasting," they also wrote that "history teaches us that even if AI disrupts the labor market, its impact will unfold over many decades." Given that artificial intelligence technology is still in its early stages, its precise longer-term impact on global labor markets remains uncertain.

If workers refrain from making full use of AI out of concern for their jobs, it could compromise the productivity boost the new technology promises. Labor market expert Weber urged companies and workers to adapt to the changing technology landscape and seize the opportunities because for him AI technology is a "game changer." "This [technology] presents opportunities, but they need to be seized. Further development and active training of workers are essential. Not just to keep pace, but to get as far ahead as possible."

Title: How To Care About Your Job When It Doesn't Care About You

We all want to do awesome things and make an impact at work. However, what we call “work” is a relationship between employer and employee that’s inherently and persistently designed to benefit the former over the latter. How do we meaningfully contribute, earn a living, and maybe even enjoy ourselves when the organization simply does not care about us? It’s harsh, but that’s captialism, baby! Any organization (“org”) exists for a purpose that’s greater than the individuals within it (e.g., profit, public service). We are a means to that end. Same goes for anything we personally get out of the arrangement be it salary, experience, foosball tables, or free lunches. This precarious and lopsided power dynamic manifests itself in our day-to-day in a variety of weird ways we often take for granted. Even if it never gets to something as extreme as layoffs or restructuring we still have to navigate this as best we can. We need to do our best work possible all while one tiny fact looms in the back of our minds. At the end of the day we’re just line items on somebody’s spreadsheet. One prevailing assumption that crumbles under the slightest scrutiny is that an org is a cohesive entity. We all know deep down it’s merely a collective made up of people, and yet we overlook this all the time. Heaven help us all if the company refers to itself as family. Ugh! If an employer ever says “We’re like a family here” what they mean is they’re going to ruin you psychologically The head of the collective—executive leadership—isn’t a single brain. It could be 3, 5, or 7 brains all trying to act like a cohesive unit. But if you personally had 7 brains inside your head how do you think you’d come across to others? Companies are not rational actors. Anything an org does is just an emergent property of humans trying to work together. Organizations, especially large ones, are not optimizing for complete or perfect decisions. They’re optimizing for as much alignment and consensus as they can get to keep moving (sometimes by fiat). By necessity these decisions will always be suboptimal and that will infuriate workers who care about what they do. Most of these decisions will not make sense because we can’t interpret a collective action as if it came from an individual. Rich Gilbert nails it in his great video “Caring Less About Work can get us what we really want”: If you’re going to work and and you’re getting frustrated and you’re intelligent and you’re looking around at all the dummies around that are not making the right decision, that is by design. We can plead, “How could they DO this?” or complain, “This is a dumb decision,” but executive leadership really is at arm’s length to us and our work. Leadership lacks the detail we regularly see in the course of our work and they’re dealing in the abstract. Actions from leadership will therefore often feel extreme, sudden, swift, half-baked, reactive, fickle, or temperamental. The ultimate effect is that the org doesn’t care about us. One could even argue that it cannot care about us. An org is operating on another plane of reality entirely. Whatever it “does” says nothing about the individuals along for the ride. We’re better off not trying to interpret its actions too closely, lest we break our brains. Most of the time Hanlon’s razor explains the dysfunction we see, but the nature of orgs can also provide temptation or cover for some willful disregard and gaslighting. A good example of gaslighting might be a lack of true upward mobility. Does the company promote often? Or does it say it will and then take forever to actually do it? How about raises—do they even happen and how are they calculated? Does the company promote from within or does it recruit a higher position with a new joiner? That’s the carrot, but the stick is far worse! We’re always on the chopping block whether we know it or not. Not even management or the CTO are safe. Layoffs are ever-present and come in several forms. If we’re unlucky enough to work somewhere that does stack ranking (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Shopify) we can kinda sorta at least see it coming. Yay? Despite all evidence to the contrary CEOs absolutely love this shit. They definitely do not care who’s let go and for those who remain—until the next quarter—they don’t care about the paranoia or distrust it causes. When I interviewed at Meta, they had me do interviews with four engineers, seemingly chosen at random from within the company. The last guy had been there by far the longest. I asked him “What’s it like to work there?” and he said “Oh, working here will rewire your brain.” Maybe stack ranking is too cumbersome… Probably best to just do layoffs arbitrarily. The company doesn’t even need to be in trouble! Entirely profitable companies can do layoffs, often more than once and with impunity. It’s a great flex for shareholders—so trendy that the stock price might go down if CEOs don’t do it. WTF? As Anil Dash notes this is more than just cutting costs: Big tech CEOs and VCs really love performing for each other. We know they hang out in group chats like high schoolers, preening and sending each other texts, each trying to make sure they’re all wearing the latest fashions, whether it’s a gold chain or a MAGA hat or just repeating a phrase that they heard from another founder. The “return to office” push is another such trend. There’s no positive intepretation for it that has any basis in our post-2020 reality. Even supposing it’s not a “quiet layoff” it’s still not good. Executives continue to poke this bear—up to a full 5 days a week in a physical office—and when we go along with it then the org knows it can do almost anything it wants to us. And perhaps the darkest trend in recent times is the holy grail for CEOs—not hiring people in the first place. when a leader says human workers are a source of “bottlenecks”, and that automation is the source of “solutions”, pay very, very, very close attention If people think “AI” can meaningfully replace human developers, we’re in for a reckoning very soon. For one, we need junior developers and senior developers cannot exist in a vacuum. A generational talent gap is coming. For another, worsening software quality will erode and ruin companies. We’re left to ride this wave until orgs finally comprehend that developers do more than just produce code. Ahem, that last section got a little negative! However, a sober acknowledgment of the circumstances around us is the first step in loving our jobs. Yes, really. We can throw up our hands and lament that we’re just cogs in the machine, but I prefer to turn that idiom on its head a bit. It’s an apt metaphor. I’m just one gear of many. I have limited capabilities as do my neighbouring gears—I can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. When I do something my neighbours react in turn, and vice versa. We come in different sizes and shapes resulting in differences in torque transmission, rotational speed, and so on. My direct neighbours are very obviously cooperating with me as our teeth are interlocking. Conversely, the further away a gear is from me the less direct, and evident, our influence on each other becomes. The overall machine from my point of view begins to act strangely, resists me, or jams up completely. This actual machine would certainly be useless if it were real. The point is there’s little sense in struggling over the distant cogs but there’s plenty to focus on right around us. The concentric circles of concern, influence, and control, popularized by Stephen Covey, is a famous framework for personal effectiveness and decision-making that translates extremely well to the context of an org. The org overall is our circle of concern—it completely surrounds us but is so far removed that we can only observe and adapt to it in relatively minor ways. What this means is we can put the overall organization and its shenanigans in the back of our minds while we optimize our local relationships and maximize our job satisfaction with real people and meaningful tasks. This is within our circle of influence. Namely, this is our manager, our reports, and our peers or teammates. We should figure out what our manager needs in order to perform their job and then become their ally towards those causes. This feedback loop builds trust very quickly and we’ll feel more empowered. Our boss also acts as a “canary in the coal mine”—if they’re comfortable in the org maybe we can be, too. Quick note: the advice above only works if our boss is a true leader and has our backs. If they’re driven by ego or more interested in licking executives’ boots, fuck 'em. If we ourselves have direct reports, then we practice servant leadership and put as much energy into these relationships as we can. Listen to them every day, figure out what they need, and collaborate with them on those actions. I know I became the leader I am today thanks to my reports. Obviously we spend most of our time with our fellow developers, designers, architects, QAs, product managers, analysts, and so on. These are the people, on a daily basis, that we want to impress and be impressed by. Ideally, they’re just plain fun to hang out with, too! Never underestimate how much job satisfaction can be derived from the mutual respect and admiration among people who like each other and are operating at the top of their game. This is the real company that we work for, as it were. It’s a subset of the overall org that we can readily interpret because none of it is abstract. It also means we don’t have to withdraw or disengage under the crushing weight of organizational nonsense. There will always be a venue where we can practice core principles—empathy, support, excellence, collaboration, camaraderie—and that means we can still grow our careers and our networks. Once we’ve drawn our local boundaries we know where to best apply ourselves. However, we also need to understand our individual boundaries, or rather how much we apply ourselves. This is within our circle of control. We start by not volunteering at work. We already have a job that we get paid for, so anything beyond that is extra work and in case I haven’t been clear so far—the org won’t care. Despite our best intentions, such work will be thankless and the law of diminishing returns will slap us in the face so hard we’ll get whiplash. We can do ourselves some serious lasting damage if we don’t exercise a healthy level of self-discipline. If you push yourself to your limits and burn out for a company, you are trading years of your future productivity for minor gains in the present. This isn’t the same as coasting, holding back, or phoning it in. There are plenty of ways to do a lot of good work within our circle of control. Indeed, it’s the only thing we truly control—applying our skills and abilities and getting direct satisfaction from that. There will always be times where we feel an urge to do more than asked, show some initiative, or simply seek appreciation from those beyond our circle of influence. We can indulge these urges, if we want, but we must be mindful. Whenever we’re doing extra work it should be clear to us why we’re doing it. The simplest (and least likely) reason to “volunteer” ourselves is because the org compensates us for it. What? It could happen! Maybe. Telling my boss “yes,” when they asked if I speak Spanish fluently and following it up with, “but not for free,” has been the highlight of my day, so far. Alternatively, we can “compensate” ourselves. We can always do extra work as long as we’re getting something out of it. This runs the gamut from acquiring a new skill to optimizing an annoying workflow bottleneck to securing our team’s delivery of a long-awaited feature. Whatever the reason or result, any extra work is a courtesy we extend to ourselves or our circle of influence. We should always assume that only we (or our teammates) will appreciate it. If that’s not enough to justify the effort then we don’t do it. This threshold of what constitutes extra work (or if we should do it) will be personal. The calculation will vary per person. Some can tolerate a great deal if the pay is good, while others can’t. Others will risk burning themselves out doing small favors for everybody, and others won’t. To each their own, I say. We can’t feel guilty or less of ourselves when we see somebody else’s circle of control is different than our own. We can only define it for ourselves and work happily within those confines. We should be careful about counting any vague, top-down forms of recognition as fair exchange for extra work or validation that we’re doing a good job. If we’re doing great work everyone will know because our circle of influence (manager, reports, peers) will be singing our praises. Word will spread. We don’t need to actively seek out credit or accolades by trying to do more. Either way, the slippery slope here is that an understanding of your contributions loses valuable detail at the org level. By definition, the wider our reputation the less control we have over its interpretaton. The org doesn’t care about us, so when all is said and done even the brightest star at the company will still be a resource. If you always deliver, they’ll always lean on you. And the more efficient you are? The more you get exploited. This perverse form of “recognition” could backfire on us in several ways. We might become the subject matter expert for some arcane legacy system or a new feature that requires constant maintenance. We risk getting typecast as “The Only Person Who Knows How To Do X”. We’ll get saddled with an additional workload or a new role we don’t actually have the bandwidth for. Again, we might actually be OK with such recognition—some could be legitimate career opportunities—but let’s not fool ourselves into thinking it’s true gratitude on the part of the org. However much we ingratiate ourselves with the org nothing is guaranteed. Despite the many YouTubers who naively pontificate on how to become recession-proof or dodge layoffs whenever the org flinches, no single company is going to save us. We have to be ready to save ourselves, and at any moment. This means job seeking on a casual and continual basis. Treat it like a hobby. Yes, even if we have a job already. And yes, even if we love that job. Think of the activities we do almost exclusively when we’re between jobs and do them on a smaller scale more regularly. Keeping our resume up to date, for instance, is far easier if we document our accomplishments as they happen. We can also practice other activities like staying in touch with colleagues, researching companies and their cultures, attending meetups or networking events, and even doing interviews! A low key job search can help in a few ways. For one, should we suddenly find ourselves unemployed we’re better prepared. We’ve already done some of the legwork that’d feel much harder to do in the moment. Any practice we’ve done also comes across as confidence to potential recruiters and interviewers. Second, it’s a chance for introspection and self-awareness. We’ll come to know more clearly what we like or dislike about our current job. It will also help to identify what we’re capable of and what we expect of ourselves or others. Useful for future jobs, yes, but this understanding makes us better at our current job, too. If nothing else, it might just cheer us up from time to time. I’ve had more than one Very Bad Day that found me cruising jobs on LinkedIn during my lunch break. And at one particularly toxic company I had a draft resignation letter open for a couple of months. Whenever the job wore me down I’d edit it a bit more. You know, as a treat! By the time I actually sent that letter it was bulletproof and very satisfying. Ultimately, proactive job seeking like this provides us with confidence, autonomy, and options. I’ve tried very hard to describe organizational behavior on its own terms and not as the deliberate intent of specific people. Just like us, executives have a role to play as part of the org, too. They may benefit from the system more than we do but they’re subjected to it all the same. Your CEO might actually be a nice human being. Most of them are! Elon Musk, on the other hand, is a demon wearing a meat suit. It’s the billionaires—and leaders who emulate them—that we need to worry about. So, I don’t have any useful advice for Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, or Altman. For anyone else in a leadership position I can only hope you looking into every nook and cranny of your org, seeing the people working for you, and doing right by them as best you can. I’ll admit I started writing this while in a somewhat bitter mood. However, it was a good exercise in helping me firm up some positive and actionable lessons. I find it reassuring that how I navigate an org doesn’t have to contradict my personal principles or how I work. In fact, they’re the very tools I need. I firmly believe that we can find a way to exist—flourish, even—without the org eroding our personal values. We don’t want to be naive, but that doesn’t mean we just give in to cynicism. I hate my job. The work sucks. The people suck. The pay sucks.looks up and sees motivational poster on wallWell this changes everything The steps seem simple enough. Make peace with the fact that any org is an irrational entity that always exists on the periphery. Focus our attention and effort on our circle of influence. Maintain rigorous and healthy personal boundaries. Always be ready to move on. It sucks that we have to do so even if we like where we work or feel like we’re doing well. It’s human nature to worry less about our well-being when the risks or costs are not evident or immediate. However, things are lovely until suddenly they’re not. Protect yourself. My promise to you is that there will be far more good days than bad days. Ultimately, the fact that your job doesn’t care about you is liberating! It’s not personal. You do you. My promise to myself is that I’m going to spend less time accommodating the company and more time empowering myself. Less time worried about what the CEO thinks and more time worried about how my coworkers feel. Less energy trying to save the world and more time simply being proud of myself and my work. We all want to do awesome things and make an impact at work. However, what we call “work” is a relationship between employer and employee that's inherently and persistently designed to benefit the former over the latter. How do we meaningfully contribute, earn a living, and maybe even enjoy ourselves when the organization simply does not care about us? Matt Hogg FYI Web developer. Technical leader. Husband. Father.

Use the controls in the far right panel to increase or decrease the number of terms automatically displayed (or to completely turn that feature off). Archives Increased sea-level contribution from northwestern Greenland for models that reproduce observations, Badgeley et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences The Greenland Ice Sheet has been thinning over the past several decades and is expected to contribute significantly to sea-level rise over the coming century. Ice flow models that make these projections, however, tend to underestimate the amount of mass lost from the ice sheet compared to observations, which complicates adaptation and mitigation planning in coastal regions. Here, we constrain a model of northwestern Greenland with a time series of satellite-derived surface velocity data and time-dependent physics to infer unknown ice properties. The model reproduces observed mass loss over the past 13 y within uncertainty. This model—constrained by more data—leads to about 8 to 17% greater sea-level rise contribution from this region by 2100. Evidence of Emerging Increasing Trends in Observed Subdaily Heavy Precipitation Frequency in the United States, Mascaro et al., Geophysical Research Letters The magnitude and frequency of heavy precipitation are expected to increase under warming temperatures caused by climate change. These trends have emerged in observational records but with much larger evidence on a daily rather than a subdaily scale. Here, we quantify long-term changes in heavy precipitation frequency in the United States using hourly observations in 1949–2020 from 332 gauges. We demonstrate that, when analyzed collectively, the frequencies of heavy precipitation at multiple durations from hourly to daily exhibit an increase that cannot be explained by natural climate variability. Upward trends are significant at ∼20%–40% of the gauges throughout the country except for the coastal western and southeastern regions, with higher percentages for longer durations. We also show that the frequency of hourly heavy precipitation has mainly grown after ∼2000, thus explaining the limited evidence of trends at the subdaily scale reported in past studies. Giuseppe Mascaro thanks funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) awards #2212702: “CAS-Climate: A Novel Process-Driven Method for Flood Frequency Analysis Based on Mixed Distributions” and #2221803: “Collaborative Research: CAS—Climate: Improving Nonstationary Intensity-Duration-Frequency Analysis of Extreme Precipitation by Advancing Knowledge on the Generating Mechanisms.” Battery electric vehicles show the lowest carbon footprints among passenger cars across 1.5–3.0 °C energy decarbonisation pathways, Šimaitis et al., Communications Earth & Environment Passenger car carbon footprints are highly sensitive to future energy systems, a factor often overlooked in life cycle assessment. We use a time-dependent prospective life cycle assessment to enhance carbon footprints under four 1.5–3.0 °C decarbonisation pathways for electricity, fuel, and hydrogen from an energy-based integrated assessment model. Across 5000 comparative cases, battery electric vehicles consistently have the lowest carbon footprints compared to hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell vehicles. For example, battery electric vehicles show an average 32 to 47% lower footprint than hybrid combustion in 3.0 °C and 1.5 °C climate-compatible futures, respectively. This is driven by greater projected decarbonisation of electricity compared to fossil-dominated fuels and hydrogen. Battery electric vehicles meaningfully retain their advantage for mileages over 100,000 km, even in regions with carbon-intensive electricity since these are anticipated to decarbonise the most. Although our study supports battery electric vehicles as the most reliable climate-mitigation option for passenger cars, reducing their high manufacturing footprint remains important. Can dissent be meaningfully measured in an overwhelming consensus? A citation network case study in climate change research, Grunert, PLOS Clim ate In scientific discourse, the prevalence of overwhelming consensus obscures the presence of dissenting views as well as their characteristics. This paper explores the potential to meaningfully measure dissent within the context of such a consensus, using climate change research as a case study. Using citation analysis to explore the dynamics of scientific publications and the reception of dissenting opinions, this project questions whether there may be a methodological framework for quantifying dissent. This study employs analysis of citation networks to assess the visibility and impact of minority viewpoints, as well as the viability of such a study. The findings indicate that because dissent in climate change research is miniscule such measurements are limited. Despite that finding, researchers on the fringe of scientific consensus have an outsized impact on social viewpoints. This project has potential to disrupt the ways researchers critically consider the relevance of dissenting research in their own fields, and to think of ways to embrace the impact of research that expands their fields. In the face of anti-science politics, silence is not without cost, Editors, Nature We recognize that not all scientific leaders are in a position to be able to speak out, particularly those in countries where doing so could incur a penalty — or even punishment. That is why our call is to international scientific organizations. Academies in countries where the freedom to dissent is protected should also make their concerns known. All need to be aware that silence is also not without cost.

Title: Bernie Sanders Slams Job Cuts, Says AI Should Give Workers More Time Off: 'Instead Of Throwing You Out On The Street...'

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is advocating for a 32-hour workweek, citing the potential for advancements in artificial intelligence and automation to provide workers with more personal time. What Happened: Sanders, in a recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, outlined his vision for a future where AI and automation drive increased productivity and efficiency, leading to reduced working hours for employees. “Instead of throwing you out on the street, I’m going to reduce your workweek to 32 hours,” Sanders stated. Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share. The Vermont senator underscored the potential benefits of technology for workers, suggesting it could offer more time for family, friends and education. Sanders introduced the “Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act” last year, which mandates overtime pay for any work beyond 32 hours in a week. The proposed change would be gradually implemented over a four-year period. See Also: Peter Thiel turned $1,700 into $5 billion—now accredited investors are eyeing this software company with similar breakout potential. Learn how you can invest with $1,000 at just $0.30/share. Why It Matters: The proposal comes at a time when the impact of AI and automation on the workforce is a hot topic. Just days before Sanders’ podcast appearance, Microsoft MSFT announced its third round of layoffs for 2025, primarily targeting the sales team and other customer-facing roles. This move was attributed to AI-driven workforce shifts. Similarly, Amazon AMZN CEO Andy Jassy recently warned that AI would reduce the company's corporate workforce due to efficiency gains, sparking backlash from employees. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase JPM CEO Jamie Dimon admitted that U.S. companies are short on workers who can code software, secure networks and run complex projects.

Title: Xbox and Meta officially release limited edition black and green Meta Quest 3S bundle

Though if you want a quality VR headset, perhaps saving for a Quest 3 is a better plan. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A few days ago we were treated to a sneak peak of the recent collaboration between Xbox and Meta Quest. The Xbox themed virtual reality headset was leaked by a BestBuy employee earlier this week, but now the official news blast is out. This limited edition black and green Meta Quest 3S is now available for purchase on Meta's website, or at Best Buy for folks in the USA, Argos and EE for UK readers. The headset looks almost exactly how we pictured it, harkening back to the original Xbox design. The matt black finish is highlighted with vibrant green trimmings, which I have to admit do look pretty cool. There's something to a VR setup that's giving Matrix aesthetics, just as long as I don't also have to be held in a weird gooey egg thing while machines harvest my life force. The headset would have to be a little bit cooler before I sign up for that. The special Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition bundle is going for $400 USD, but includes a bit of extra kit. Alongside the black and green 128 GB Meta Quest 3S, you also get Meta Touch Plus controllers, a limited-edition Xbox Wireless controller, and a Meta Quest Elite strap all themed to match. Alongside the bundled hardware are also a couple of subscriptions to help let you try out some VR games. You get 3 months of Meta Horizon+ and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to try. This will let folks try games like Asgard's Wrath 2, which has been a highlight for VR gamers since its release. Judging by the included Xbox Wireless controller, this bundle isn't intended to limit folks to VR games on the headset. Instead it looks designed to be used as sort of theatre room replacement, where you can play all your Xbox games from the comfort of your headset. It's also worth noting if you already have GamePass these extra 3 months should stack and give you a bit of extra time on your subscription. The thing about this bundle I struggle with, however, is you'll never see it when using it. Half the joy of a limited edition fancy looking console or controller is looking down at it and smiling smugly to yourself during use. Thinking how it's cool that you have this nifty version of a thing you love that's just a little bit different to what's out there. This is really hard to do while wearing a VR headset. If you are keen on this collaboration, you might want to get in fast; stock is said to be super limited for this bundle. Personally, I'd forgo this and work on getting a full Quest 3 instead. Those heightened specs are well worth the price difference—which is why that's our pick as best VR headset right now—and that's certainly more beneficial than a black and green colourway.

in Disney, Entertainment Credit: Disney In a recent report by TheWrap, it has been revealed that The Walt Disney Company is once again reducing its workforce, this time within its Entertainment and ESPN product and technology divisions. According to an unnamed source familiar with the matter, approximately 2% of the staff in these divisions has been let go as part of a broader rebalancing of resources. Despite the layoffs, Disney has emphasized that this move will not slow down its commitment to investing in product and technology growth. The company has been taking steps to streamline operations and adjust to the evolving media landscape, even as it continues to expand in other areas. This round of layoffs marks the fifth such occurrence in just a year at Disney. However, sources suggest that these cuts are distinct from previous ones, as they are not directly tied to any of the earlier rounds of job reductions. The decision is seen as part of Disney’s broader effort to optimize resources across its divisions, ensuring long-term success in the face of a rapidly changing entertainment environment. Led by Adam Smith, who joined Disney in 2024, the product and technology division has undergone significant changes under his leadership. Smith’s team has been actively working on enhancing Disney’s streaming platforms, particularly Disney+ and Hulu, with a focus on improving user experience and expanding subscriber perks. Notably, Disney has recently cracked down on password sharing for its streaming services, introduced new benefits for subscribers, and made strides in improving ad targeting through a new partnership with Amazon. Disney has also been exploring new ways to enhance the viewing experience. One of the latest initiatives includes the introduction of virtual “concessions stands” and “storefronts” within its streaming platforms, allowing viewers to purchase products directly related to the shows they are watching. Additionally, Disney is gearing up for the launch of a new ESPN streaming service later this fall, a move that marks the company’s continued push into the digital and sports streaming space. While these ongoing restructuring efforts are reshaping Disney’s internal operations, the company’s strategic goals remain focused on growth and innovation, particularly in the product and technology sectors. This wave of job cuts follows a larger trend of layoffs at Disney. Just earlier this month, the company laid off hundreds of employees from its entertainment and corporate financial divisions. Back in early 2025, under 200 employees from ABC News Group and its entertainment networks were also let go. This followed a series of cuts last fall that saw hundreds of corporate employees and ABC staff members losing their jobs. As Disney continues to adapt to the changing media landscape, the company’s commitment to innovation and product development remains a central focus, despite the ongoing workforce reductions. As the year progresses, Disney fans and industry observers alike will be keeping a close eye on how these changes will affect the company’s future growth and strategic direction. in Disney, Entertainment Eva was born and raised in the beautiful state of Oregon but has since relocated and lives in New York City.
