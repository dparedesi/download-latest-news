This week was marked by trade tensions and tariff newsflow, with barbs being exchanged between the US and Brazil. Dollar was steady, but Bitcoin surged to levels not seen before. There were other news, including results flow in India as well as corporate developments. In corporate news, Delta Air Lines soared on strong quarterly results and a raised outlook, while WK Kellogg's shares jumped on reports of a $3 billion acquisition by Ferrero Group. Meanwhile, the EU is urgently seeking a trade deal with the US to avert further tariffs, and the UAE was formally removed from the EU's high-risk list for money laundering. Here are the key talking points this week: Trade Tensions The Biggest Event Global trade tensions just got a whole lot worse! The US is leading the charge with a slew of new tariff announcements that are sparking outrage worldwide. Canada's getting slammed with a 35% tariff on a bunch of imports, effective Aug. 1, because the US claims they're not doing enough to stop fentanyl trafficking. And that's not all - over 20 other countries are in the crosshairs, with tariffs ranging from 15% to 20%. Brazil's getting hit with a whopping 50% tariff, and copper imports are facing a 50% tariff. The US is also threatening a 200% tariff on pharma imports if companies don't move production to the US. This is all about "reciprocal tariffs," but it feels like a full-on trade war. Affected countries are already vowing to fight back and protect their workers, naturally so. Expert Opinion S Naren's insight that "every stock is discovered" reflects India's maturing stock market, where intense competition among brilliant stock pickers has left few undervalued opportunities, pushing investors toward contrarian picks in hated sectors like oil and gas, supported by a 2023 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research showing market efficiency increases with analyst density. The shift from value to momentum investing in a late-cycle economy aligns with historical patterns; a 2021 Journal of Finance study found momentum strategies outperform value strategies by 6% annually in late economic cycles, a trend potentially amplified by India's current earnings revisions and strong domestic flows. Conversation with Sajjid Chinoy and Chetan Ahya suggest that Asia will have to brace for a slowdown, and that may make it difficult for higher growth countries like India to deliver growth too. The lone ranger was JP Morgan's Rajiv Batra, whose note suggests that this quarter will serve as a transition from underwhelming earnings to a decent recovery, driven by the low base from the previous year and a resurgence in economic momentum. Batra expects the Nifty to trade at a level between 26,500-30,000 in the next 6-9 months. When It Rains, It Pours The week had a lopsided newsflow, with the second half standing true to the adage that 'when it rains, it pours'. TCS beat earnings expectations with a better than expected delivery in net profit, but a sluggish revenue growth and a wobble around demand. CEO K Krithivasan is optimistic about new services and deal wins, despite global economic uncertainty. And this weighed in on the stock price, with the IT index coming off for three days on a trot. Meanwhile, Hindustan Unilever is shaking things up with Priya Nair set to become the first female CEO and MD in the company's 92-year history. And Glenmark Pharmaceuticals is celebrating a massive $2 billion deal with AbbVie for its cancer treatment, with a cool $700 million upfront payment. The stock has gained 25% this month, with a 15% move coming in post the announcement. Assumptions Of Dollar Dominance Forever, Are Shaky The past 25 years has seen the UK, France and US issue far too much debt, which Asian countries stacked up in their foreign exchange reserves out of fear for a new Asian crisis. The next question is whether this imbalance can endure. And, if not, how will it be resolved. The answer to the first question is increasingly obvious: Asian countries are becoming ever less fond of US treasuries, gilts and OATs. So what happens next? History shows that such imbalances usually spur an important shift in the value of exchange rates. The country that has issued too many bonds sees its currency fall, while the one that has saved too much sees its currency re-rate. Imagine what will happen to the dollar ahead! Lastly, a (not so) personal question. Fed up with your paycheck? How does $200 million-plus sound? As per a Bloomberg article, that’s what Meta is apparently paying Ruoming Pang, who used to run Apple’s AI models team. More importantly, it is in line with the compensation of other members of Meta’s new “superintelligence” group. Why is this happening? Well, we know AI is all pervasive. But there are minds like Eric Schmidt who believe that the AI revolution is 'underhyped'. If this is an indication that you are assuming that it is overhyped, maybe you should rethink your estimates or assumptions. Have a great weekend. Until Next Time... Niraj Shah

Title: Exclusive: Crypto and stablecoin infrastructure startup zerohash to raise $100 million at almost $1 billion valuation
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/07/11/zerohash-stablecoin-fundraise-interactive-brokers-100-million-1-billion-valuation/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T18:03:43Z

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. Stablecoin fever is still running hot. Zerohash, a crypto and stablecoin infrastructure startup, is set to raise about $100 million at nearly a $1 billion valuation, according to two sources familiar with the deal. The publicly traded online brokerage Interactive Brokers is leading the funding round, said the two sources, who spoke to Fortune on the condition of anonymity to discuss private business dealings. Spokespeople for Zerohash and Interactive Brokers declined to comment. The fundraise follows Zerohash’s Series D from 2022, when the company raised $105 million from investors including Bain Capital, Nyca, and Point72 Ventures. The Series D valued the company at $340 million, according to data from PitchBook. Founded in 2017, Zerohash (formerly styled as Zero Hash) provides backend infrastructure that helps banks, brokerages, as well as fintech companies offer cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other digital assets to their customers. Now, the company has become an influential player in the hot sector of stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar. Zerohash partnered with Stripe to help the fintech giant’s customers go from cash to stablecoins through Zerohash’s network of banking relationships and regulatory licenses. It has also worked with Securitize, another crypto startup, to help traditional finance titans like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton enter the tokenization race, or when issuers put traditional financial assets like money market funds into blockchain wrappers. Zerohash lets customers exchange stablecoins for tokenized assets. Other Zerohash clients include prediction marketplace Kalshi as well as neobank MoneyLion. Zerohash isn’t the only stablecoin startup to attract tens of millions of dollars in venture capital over the past year. After Stripe announced its acquisition of the stablecoin company Bridge for $1.1 billion in October, similarly positioned startups have raked in investor funds. In December, BVNK raised $50 million in a Series B that valued it at around $750 million. In March, Mesh said it had raised $82 million. And on Thursday, Nick van Eck, son of noteworthy investment management CEO Jan van Eck, announced that Agora, a stablecoin company he cofounded, had raised $50 million in a round led by longtime crypto investor Paradigm. The Bridge acquisition is just one reason why investors are piling into stablecoins. The crypto markets are frothy again as Bitcoin has repeatedly notched new all-time highs in 2025. In early June, the stablecoin issuer Circle went public in a gangbusters IPO. Its shares have more than quintupled since its stock started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company’s market capitalization is around $46 billion as of Friday morning. And in mid-June, the Senate passed a bill that would regulate crypto assets. The House is now considering the legislation. Amid the regulatory push and crypto boom, Fortune 500 companies have shown interest in the technology. Retailers like Walmart and Amazon are looking into stablecoin adoption. And Big Tech firms like Meta, Apple, Airbnb, and Google have all spoken with crypto companies since January about integrating stablecoins into their payments infrastructure. As opposed to issuers like Agora, which has its own stablecoin and creates white-label tokens for its partners, Zerohash acts as the connective tissue for the stablecoin ecosystem. Its tools for developers let customers more easily go between cash and stablecoins, serving as an intermediary amid skyrocketing demand for the sector. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Preorder NOW to get Meta's Limited Edition Oakley smart glasses before everyone else
URL: https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/preorder-now-to-get-metas-limited-edition-oakley-smart-glasses-before-everyone-else

These 24K gold-accented glasses arrive July 22 but could easily sell out before then; the rest of the Meta Oakley collection arrive later this summer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has launched preorders for its Meta Oakley HSTN Warm Gray Prizm 24K Polarized smart glasses, the first version of these glasses available. And given how quickly they're likely to sell out, you'll want to grab them while you still can! This is Meta's second Limited Edition launch in recent days, after the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition that sold out quickly on many retail sites. So far, these Meta Oakley HSTN Limited Edition glasses are only available on Meta, and there's no saying how much stock is available or if resellers will snag them all. You can wait until "later this summer" for the other HSTN frames — Desert with Ruby lenses, Black with Polar Black, Shiny Brown with Polar Deep-Water, Black with Transitions Amethyst, or Clear with Transitions Grey — and spend only $399, but without the gold accents. The Meta Oakley HSTN glasses offer portable Meta AI insights, a built-in 12MP ultrawide camera with 3024 X 4032 resolution photos, open-ear speakers, IPX4 water resistance, and eight hours of battery life — double what the Ray-Ban Meta glasses offer. This limited-edition version comes with gold accents and isn't likely to stay in stock for long! These striking Meta AI glasses measure 147 mm hinge-to-hinge or 158mm temple length, with no alternate sizes, so check your current glasses to see if they'll fit you well. Meta also doesn't seem to be selling a prescription version of the Limited Edition glasses, unfortunately. They confirmed to us that the $399 glasses pairs will be "Rx-ready" with -6.00 to +4.00 lens power, so you may want to skip this Limited Edition if you want to add some clarity to your AI glasses. If you compare the Meta Oakley HSTNs vs. the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, these Oakley glasses have faster charging, higher video resolution at 3K vs. 1080p, and double the battery life at eight hours. That last point is what makes these Meta Oakley glasses so compelling: They're much less likely to die on you during an all-day outing, especially if you use battery-burning features like Meta AI. We'd hoped that Amazon Prime Day would bring prices down on Ray-Ban Meta glasses, but they've remained stubbornly full price, up to $379. So the price gap between these and the Ray-Bans isn't that great, considering the golden flourishes that Oakley and Meta added. Overall, these Meta Oakley HSTN Limited Edition glasses are striking with their gold finishes and light frames, but some people will prefer to wait for models that aren't quite as flashy, or grab one of the cheaper Ray-Ban models for $299. Alternatively, you can wait for the third-gen Ray-Ban glasses that leaked yesterday, which are rumored to feature a battery boost.

Title: Bitcoin ETF IBIT Sees Surge In AUM, Marking New Institutional Peak

Time Published: 2025-07-11T16:30:40Z

Since its inception early last year, Bitcoin Spot ETFs have become a crucial part of its market dynamics. During inception, several spot BTC ETFs were launched, but BlackRock’s IBIT has turned out to be quite successful, which currently stands as the biggest BTC spot exchange product. While Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) continue to record inflows, BlackRock’s BTC ETF, IBIT, is witnessing substantial growth compared to other products. Presently, the product appears to be leading the charge with a surge to new levels, surpassing other funds. In a post on the X platform, The Kobeissi Letter, a leading commentary on the global capital market, announced that the Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has hit a new milestone in terms of assets under management. The assets under management have surged to a value of $76 billion, highlighting the quickening rate of institutional acceptance in the cryptocurrency industry. According to the Kobeissi Letter, total assets have tripled over the past 200 trading days, as per ZeroHedge. This fresh milestone by IBIT cements BlackRock’s dominant position in the broader spot BTC ETF sector. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust generates unprecedented AUM, it demonstrates the increasing belief among major investors that Bitcoin merits a crucial place at the global investment table. BlackRock’s IBIT sharp rise in AUM to a new high appears to be exceptional, as many funds took several years to experience this growth. It is worth noting that it took more than 15 years for GLD, the biggest gold ETF, to achieve the same feat. The Kobeissi Letter also reported that the IBIT’s Bitcoin holdings have increased substantially during the period. Data from the market expert shows that IBIT BTC holding has grown to over 700,000 BTC for the first time in history. Comparing this amount of Bitcoin acquired with that of MicroStrategy, a firm that is mainly recognized for its strategic accumulation of BTC, it is 100,000 BTC more than the total holdings of the company. Given the stunning growth of the IBIT, the Kobeissi Letter believes that the overall “crypto markets are making history.” Lark Davis, a crypto expert and entrepreneur, has outlined a new trend in buying activity among institutional players. Despite the continuous capital inflows into ETFs, many investors appear to be more interested in acquiring Bitcoin directly than through ETFs. The expert revealed that BTC purchases by public businesses are outpacing those of ETFs. In addition, Davis stated that the number of Bitcoin Treasury businesses is growing every week, as institutional investors continue to hoard BTC in unprecedented quantities. Considering this mass accumulation by public institutions, the expert is confident that the market is about to go insane from here. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

U.S. equities were lower at midday after President Donald Trump made more tariff announcements. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all declined. Trump's plan to slap 35% tariffs on Canadian imports dragged shares of Canada-based companies, including Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and Spotify Technology (SPOT). Shares of lithium producer Albemarle (ALB) dropped on a UBS downgrade, with analysts pointing to an oversupply of lithium threatening to reduce prices.

Shares of cryptocurrency-related firms Strategy (MSTR), MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) gained as bitcoin traded at an all-time high. Shares of military drone makers AeroVironment (AVAV) and Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (KTOS) were lifted by comments from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who announced steps to remove government red tape to boost more Pentagon spending on drones produced in the U.S. Oil and gold futures surged.

Despite pushback from rival SpaceX, AST SpaceMobile has received FCC approval to launch the company’s massive prototype satellite for phone connectivity from space. On Friday, the FCC granted AST SpaceMobile an experimental license to essentially test FM1, a giant square-shaped satellite that the company has been aiming to launch this month. Although the experimental license prohibits AST from “conducting any commercial operations” through the satellite, the FCC's approval brings the company a step closer to building its satellite-to-phone internet system —avoiding what could have been a prolonged delay The FM1 marks AST’s first attempt at sending up a second-generation BlueBird satellite, which spans around 200 square meters — or about three times the size of the company’s first-generation BlueBirds. The FM1 weighs in at nearly 13,000 pounds and features a "phased array antenna" at about 199 square meters, letting it operate as a cell tower in space. The FM1’s increased size and capability promises to help the Texas-based AST SpaceMobile deliver even better satellite internet connectivity to everyday smartphones through carriers including AT&T and Verizon. The satellite connectivity is designed to power voice, video calls and data to users in cellular dead zones. But the company has been facing a growing rivalry with SpaceX, which has been developing its own competing solution in the cellular Starlink service, set to officially launch through T-Mobile on July 23rd. Earlier this year, SpaceX criticized AST’s plans to launch the FM1, pointing out alleged flaws in the company’s application, including its orbital safety plan for the satellite. Last month, the Elon Musk company also seized on the paperwork problems with AST’s application, and urged the FCC to dismiss it. “The inconsistencies, discrepancies and inadequacies of AST’s orbital debris showings suggest its system will not promote sustainable operations in low-Earth orbit as the Commission’s rules intend,” SpaceX told the FCC on June 27th. But in response, AST told the Commission days later that SpaceX’s objections were baseless and a sign of “anticompetitive behavior aimed at impeding AST SpaceMobile’s progress toward deploying its groundbreaking space-based cellular broadband network.” The FCC itself also found many discrepancies and minor errors in AST’s application, asking them to be corrected. However, the Commission's new head, Republican Brendan Carr, has signaled his overall support for the US to expand and dominate in next-generation satellite services. In April, Carr posted pictures of his visit to AST’s headquarters in Midland, Texas. AST’s goal is to kick off its own beta service to consumers early next year. But doing so will depend on whether it can launch enough second-generation BlueBird satellites in the coming months. Currently, the company only has five first-generation BlueBird satellites in orbit when it needs at least 45 to 60 to begin offering continuous service across the US and other markets. AST also still needs to secure regulatory approval from the FCC to operate the BlueBirds for commercial phone activities. To fly up the satellites, AST has tapped both SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin. Meanwhile, the FM1 is slated to launch through India’s national space agency.

Title: Big Tech Is Making Big Money. Time for More Layoffs?

Early this month, Microsoft confirmed it was axing 9,000 employees, or about 4 percent of its workforce, in its third staffing cut of 2025. One might suppose a company that’s been laying people off for three years straight isn’t performing well or is under pressure from shareholders to reduce costs and return to profitability. But that’s not the case here: In April quarterly earnings, Microsoft reported $25.8 billion net income on $70.1 billion in revenue, with optimistic guidance for Q2. Analysts have since improved their forecasts, and on Wednesday, the company’s stock hit an all-time high. Microsoft isn’t alone in cutting workers while things are going great. Since 2022, and most recently in January, Meta has been letting thousands of employees go; it, too, has been beating expectations and reporting massive profits. Google, after layoffs in 2023 and 2024, is now offering buyouts. But the Microsoft example might be the starkest. As recently as five years ago, America’s largest tech companies represented stable, lucrative, and futureproof employment. Collecting just the right qualifications might land you a role at Google or Facebook, where you’d have some of the best and broadest prospects in the entire job market, much of which was starting to look dreary in comparison. (They made an entire movie about being Google interns! Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson were terrible in it!) Microsoft, the oldest of the bunch, represented stability twice over: a massive organization with a foot in the future, but also a place where you’d meet people who’d worked there for 30 years. As former employee Daniel Sada writes, some employees saw an implied pact. Microsoft didn’t quite pay as much as some of its peers, but it paid fine, and in exchange, “you [got] stability, reasonable work-life balance, and most importantly, no layoffs.” Now, he says, “the pact is fundamentally broken.” At Microsoft — and across formerly safe big-tech firms — it’s been replaced with new feelings of precarity. From outside the industry, one might see this as an inevitable regression to the American employment mean: an industry where workers were temporarily distracted from, or just mistaken about, the true nature of their relationship with their employers. Things were good, workplace organizing was unnecessary, and everyone was on the same team, until they weren’t, and it was too late. Your job was just another job. From inside the industry — and Microsoft — the transition has been sudden and jarring. After the last round of layoffs, an executive producer at Xbox, where cuts were especially deep, posted a message from light-years outside any imagined “pact”: Matt Turnbull, Executive Producer at Xbox Game Studios Publishing - after the Microsoft layoffs - suggesting on Linkedin that may maybe people who have been let go should turn to AI for help. He seriously thought posting this would be a good idea. As he implies, the specter of AI hangs over these layoffs and others in the industry in unsettling ways. (One major wrinkle in the story of tech-employment exceptionalism is that programming might be one of the most AI-exposed job categories of all.) And while the last few years of layoffs can be understood substantially as a consequence of massive COVID-era overhiring and executive backlash, that excuse is starting to feel insufficient. Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon, all of which are still in cost-cutting mode, are major players in AI. Amazon’s CEO warned that, after it all nets out, AI deployment within the company will probably result in cuts; Meta and Google are bragging about how much code they’re already generating with AI. For now, they’re not connecting cuts with automation, but they’re getting close: Microsoft, while touting quantifiable savings and efficiency gains from AI, is also claiming that AI was “not a predominant factor” in recent layoffs. Given the types of jobs being targeted by the company — staffers in gaming, where the company is shifting focus for other reasons, and managers whose roles aren’t particularly exposed to current AI tools — this is probably true, narrowly speaking. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t connected. Big tech may be harvesting record profits, but it’s also collectively spending hundreds of billions of dollars betting on AI (Microsoft committed to $80 billion in AI-related capital expenditures this fiscal year alone). Microsoft might not be LLMing its current employees out of their jobs today, but it’s making a massive and very public bet on its ability — and the ability of others, using its tools — to do so tomorrow. For now, maybe big tech is just looking for some extra cash for the cause. By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

Title: As tech CEOs predict AI will replace humans in just 5 years, this Fortune 500 boss says taking the focus off real people is a ‘recipe for failure’

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. AI is already leaving its mark on corporate America, with tech layoffs hitting 75,000 this year alone as companies prepare for the technology to rival humans in just five years time. While this may fuel dreams of a two-day workweek—or fear an AI-fueled apocalypse—James Zallie, CEO of Fortune 500 food ingredient company Ingredion, has a clear answer: People—and culture—still come first. “If you take your eye off either the customer or the employee and you get very internally focused, it’s a recipe for failure,” said Zallie in an appearance on the Inside the Ice House podcast, hosted by the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. And while Zallie’s $8.7 billion company has embraced technology like AI in part to predict supply chain issues, refine recipe formulations, and keep up with regulations—letting anything distract from people and culture could backfire, the baby boomer said. “I think in society today that if you don’t have a strong culture, your business will suffer. And if you don’t focus on people, you will also,” Zallie added. “People will see through whether you’re really living your values and whether you have a care for people in general.” At a time when some companies like Meta and Target have rolled back DEI initiatives, Ingredion still includes “Everybody Belongs” as one of its five core values. And while serving as CEO is the dream job title for most business leaders, Zallie said in reality, he more so sees his job as a chief clarity officer of sorts—the messenger of what the company is doing—and why. “We in positions of leadership and management have a responsibility and accountability to (employees) to continuously try to figure out on their behalf how they can have fulfilled careers, be motivated,” he said. “I look at my job as CEO as chief clarity officer.” Fortune reached out to Zallie for further comment. While Ingredion has made it clear that people are their priority, other companies are rather confident they can do more with less people. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently said that his $2 trillion company would be shedding members of its corporate workforce thanks to generative AI’s enhanced capabilities. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” Jassy wrote in an internal memo last month. Microsoft has already put some of this into action by laying off 15,000 employees this year alone. And while the company cited the changes as a means to “best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” the cuts hint at prioritization of automation. Last year, AI saved the company $500 million in its call center alone, reports Bloomberg. And while some CEOs like Salesforce’s Marc Benioff and Google’s Sundar Pichai have increasingly touted AI automation as somewhat of a flex, its replacement of workers has left many, such as software engineers, feeling helpless. Instead of using layoffs as a means to create a more leaner operation, GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke said the wiser move is to double down on talent. “The companies that are the smartest are going to hire more developers,” Dohmke said to The Silicon Valley Girl Podcast late last month. “Because if you 10x a single developer, then 10 developers can do 100x,” he said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: ‘You’re going to die tonight’: Former garda attacked and threatened to kill partner in Dublin home

Time Published: 2025-07-11T15:39:54Z
Full Content:
A man has been jailed for 20 months for attacking and threatening to kill his then partner in their Dublin home while he was a serving member of An Garda Síochána. Ian Gillen, of Carysfort Avenue, Blackrock, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to threatening to kill or cause serious harm to Jennifer Clinton on December 23rd, 2021, at Trafalgar Lane, Monkstown, and to assaulting Ms Clinton on the same occasion. After hearing facts in the case on Thursday, Judge Martin Nolan adjourned overnight. He on Friday said the custody threshold had been crossed, noting that he had considered the facts of the case, Gillen’s circumstances and mitigation. Judge Nolan said Gillen was a front-line garda who had to “make difficult decisions, and this can have an effect on a person”. He also noted that Gillen was “visited with a tragic event with the death of his son”. He imposed a prison sentence of four years, with the final 28 months suspended on strict conditions, which he said was due to the substantial mitigation and the tragedy in Gillen’s life. Insp Rachael Kilpatrick testified that the couple had socialised together in Blackrock Tennis and Bowling Club, where they were members, before the attack. They had gone home separately, with Ms Clinton arriving first. Ms Clinton told gardaí that when Gillen arrived home, he called her downstairs to sit by the fireside, where he stood over her in an intimidating manner, rebuking her and calling her names. She said he told her ‘Jen, I’m going to rip your head off’, putting her in fear, and prompting her to make an audio recording of the rest of the incident on her mobile phone. She said he punched her with a closed fist three times on top of her head. In an effort to get away, she said she needed to go to the toilet, but he refused to let her go. She eventually managed get away and locked the bathroom door behind her. She cleared the windowsill and eventually made it out of the house. She had managed to record 40 minutes of the threats. An attempt was made to play this in court, but it was not possible due to technical difficulties. A transcript of the recording was handed to the judge instead. Ms Clinton described Gillen’s conduct as pure anger. She said that any time she tried to get up, he kept telling her to sit back down. “You’re going to die tonight,” he told her three times. After Ms Clinton escaped, Gillen was arrested for coercive control. He was interviewed and the recording was played to him. He said he was embarrassed and it was not in him to hit her, but indicated it was another person in his body. “He was shocked by his own behaviour,” said Insp Kilpatrick. Gillen accepted he could snap and be angry when drinking. He said he had issues in his background, including the death of his son, which caused him to drink. He has since retired from the Garda on medical grounds and has no previous convictions. Under cross-examination by the defence, Insp Kilpatrick agreed that Gillen was a front-line garda for 40 years and had dealt with many stressful situations. She accepted that it was in the line of duty that he had to deal with his son taking his own life in his early 20s. Gillen was the first responder on the scene. His mental health deteriorated afterwards and he relied on alcohol, the court heard. Ms Clinton entered the witness box to deliver her victim impact statement. She said her life had been marked by fear and deep trauma since the prolonged assault, during which she felt overpowered and trapped. She said she still lived with the consequences every day, having been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression. “I live in a state of hypervigilance,” she said. “I lost my confidence. The memory of that night is etched into my mind and body like the cross he etched into the front door of our shared home one night in a rage.” She said that Gillen’s rising aggression while they socialised earlier that evening had prompted her to leave, but he had arrived home full of fury. “I wanted my family to know the truth if I did not survive,” she said, referring to the 40 minutes of the assault that she captured on her phone. At one point, she said, Gillen mockingly suggested that she ring Blackrock Garda station, insinuating that nobody would help her if she did because he was a serving garda. “Living with him took a deep emotional toll. I felt smaller and smaller all the time,” she said. “The man I once loved became someone I feared.” She added: “As a long-standing member of An Garda Síochána, he would present himself as a figure, someone to be believed and relied upon to uphold common decency and morality.” However, she said that he did not tarnish the reputation of An Garda Síochána, but just his own. “I’m here for justice,” she said, asking the court to take into account the enduring horror Gillen had caused. Kathleen Leader SC, defending, handed the court two testimonials and a psychologist’s report on behalf of her client, who she said was deeply ashamed and apologised for what he put Ms Clinton through. She said he had faced a number of traumatic incidents in his 40 years in the force, which had taken a toll on him and probably had not been dealt with as they should have been. She described the death of his son, while Gillen was on duty, as the worst nightmare of every guard and parent, and asked the court to take it into account. His two referees were in court to support him, she said, with one crediting her client with saving his life and the other saying that he had helped him in the prevention of suicide.

Title: U.S. stocks move lower and pull S&P 500 back from its record

Alex Veiga, Associated Press Alex Veiga, Associated Press Leave your feedback U.S. stocks are down in morning trading Friday, pulling the market back from all-time highs, as the Trump administration escalates its tariff threats against Canada. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% a day after setting a record high. The benchmark index is on pace to post its first weekly loss in three weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 279 points, or 0.6%, as of 11:06 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% lower a day after climbing to an all-time high. Both indexes are also headed for weekly losses. Bond yields rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.40%, from 4.34% late Thursday. Trump said in a letter Thursday that he will raise taxes on many imported goods from Canada to 35%, deepening the rift between the longtime North American allies. The letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is an aggressive increase to the top 25% tariff rates that Trump first imposed in March. The move is the latest bid by the White House to use threats of higher tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. in hopes of securing new trade agreements with countries around the globe, even historically close trading partners like Canada. The administration had initially set Wednesday as a deadline for countries to make deals with the U.S. or face heavy increases in tariffs. But with just two trade deals announced since April, one with the United Kingdom and one with Vietnam, the window for negotiations has been now been extended to Aug. 1. Trump also floated this week that he would impose tariffs of as much as 200% on pharmaceutical drugs and placed a 50% tariff on copper imports, matching the rates charged on steel and aluminum. The initial rollout of Trump’s tariff policies in the spring roiled financial markets. But Wall Street has been relatively stable in recent weeks, with stocks steadily rising to record levels, suggesting the market has mostly adjusted to the unpredictability of Trump’s rapidly shifting tariffs. Trade policy aside, the market is now set to shift at least some of its focus on companies due to report quarterly earnings over the next few weeks. On Friday, Levi Strauss jumped 10.9% after the jeans maker easily beat Wall Street’s sales and profit targets and raised its full-year forecast, despite expecting higher costs from tariffs. PriceSmart climbed 6.6% a day after the warehouse club operator delivered solid third-quarter results and said it’s looking into expanding into Chile. Earnings season shifts into high gear next week with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup among the big banks due to report their results on Tuesday. Wall Street analysts predict that companies in the S&P 500 will deliver 5% growth in second-quarter earnings, according to FactSet. That would mark the lowest rate since the fourth quarter of 2023. Shares in financial sector, health care and communication services companies were the biggest weights on the market Friday. Visa fell 1.5%, Gilead Sciences dropped 3.2% and Meta was 1.8% lower. Some big tech stocks rose. Chimpaker Nvidia was up 1.8%. Several airline stocks were down a day after encouraging quarterly results from Delta Air Lines set off a rally in the sector. Delta dropped 2.4%, United fell 3.9% and American was 4.1% lower. Elsewhere in the market, shares of T-Mobile slipped 0.6% after the Justice Department announced Thursday that it would not prevent the company from closing on its proposed $4.4 billion acquisition of U.S. Cellular. That deal, announced more than a year ago, had come under antitrust scrutiny from the Justice Department under President Joe Biden’s administration. U.S. Cellular shares rose 2.7%. Shares in aviation company Red Cat Holdings jumped 17.8% after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued orders aimed at ramping up production and deployment of drones. European stock indexes were broadly lower following a mostly lower finish in Asian markets. Meanwhile, bitcoin climbed to another all-time high Friday, briefly eclipsing $118,000 before easing back to around $117,800, according to Coindesk. Bitcoin’s price jump came amid bullish momentum across risk assets and coincides with Nvidia’s surge to a $4 trillion valuation. It also comes days before the U.S. Congress’ Crypto Week on July 14, where lawmakers will debate a series of bills that could define the regulatory framework for the industry. Now is your chance to help us shape future coverage of the stories that matter most to you. Left: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on July 08, 2025 in New York City. Stocks opened mixed amid the tariff deadline set by U.S. President Donald Trump as his administration awaits for countries willing to negotiate. Trump also set 25% tariffs on goods imported from South Korea and Japan and at least 14 countries are set to face new tariffs. (Photo by Michael M.

Title: Flagship Will Shutter Its Marketplace, Citing Creator Disinterest

Creator tech firm Flagship quietly revealed it’s shutting down its core ecommerce platform, according to an FAQ initially posted on its website. The final day of sales on the platform is July 16. The company originated with that platform in 2023 and bet that creators would want to curate product recommendations and earn affiliate revenue using its platform. Over the past year, more than 1,000 creators and 500 brands used the Flagship marketplace to drive sales, cofounder and CEO Youssef Ahres told ADWEEK in an email. He added that some creators earned more than $200,000 a year through Flagship. But that wasn’t enough to sustain Flagship’s core platform. “Most creators—even highly effective ones—prefer creating content over running a storefront, and it was harder than expected to get them excited about promoting new or unfamiliar brands,” Ahres, said, adding it was difficult for creators to drive consistent sales. When Flagship launched, it set out to compete with affiliate giants like LTK. The startup is now pivoting its business around an AI-powered search engine connecting brands with creators called Radar. The company’s website was redesigned last week to promote Radar. Ahres did not respond if the pivot will result in layoffs. “We’re committed to building tools that help creators earn from their influence,” said Ahres. Flagship launched in 2023 and raised an undisclosed amount in seed and Series A funding. The company’s investors include VC firms Sequoia Capital and Index Ventures, and both will continue to back the company as it transitions away from its ecommerce platform product, according to Ahres. He did not respond when asked how much Flagship had raised in total. Flagship’s ecommerce platform attracted a community of creators looking to earn affiliate commission outside of Amazon. One such creator is Caroline Moss, the writer and host of the popular shopping newsletter and podcast, Gee Thanks, Just Bought It! Her newsletter and podcast storefront lived on Flagship, and she appeared on Flagship’s website and in promotional videos. Moss announced the shuttering of Flagship on the Gee Thanks Instagram account and expressed her sadness about its closure in a blog post. She praised the platform’s ability to connect her audience to small businesses and wrote, “it gave us a home that aligned with our values.” Moss didn’t respond to ADWEEK’s request for comment. Flagship’s closure hints that startups that specialize in affiliate linking might be under threat as major platforms like TikTok launch their own ecommerce features like TikTok Shop, and integrate Amazon shopping directly into the platforms. While investors’ interest in influencer marketing firms has grown over the past year, marketers increasingly look for more specialized tools that streamline manual processes like ad buying and managing creators.

Title: Ant International refutes reporting Circle partnership, but stablecoin ambitions remain clear

Every Wednesday and Friday, TechNode’s Briefing newsletter delivers a roundup of the most important news in China tech, straight to your inbox. Ant International, the overseas arm of Ant Group, has refuted reports that it is in talks with Circle Internet Financial to integrate USDC stablecoin into its blockchain platform. Bloomberg first cited unnamed sources on July 10, claiming the two companies were exploring cooperation plans following USDC’s compliance in the United States. Just hours later, Ant International responded, stating, “The media reports are inaccurate. We currently have no such plans.” Why it matters: Ant’s quick denial underscores its cautious approach to publicizing any stablecoin tie-ups. However, it does not diminish the company’s broader ambitions in blockchain and stablecoins. As global stablecoin adoption accelerates and regulatory clarity improves, Ant is actively seeking licenses, forging partnerships, and advancing technology to bring large-scale, trusted applications to the market. Each step by Ant in this space has the potential to reshape the global digital finance landscape. Details: According to people familiar with the matter, Ant processed more than $1 trillion in transactions worldwide last year, with around one-third conducted on its blockchain infrastructure. They also said in June that Ant International is pursuing stablecoin licensing in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Luxembourg. Context: Stablecoins are a type of digital asset designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to another currency. As of June, the total circulation of stablecoins stood at around $250 billion. According to Bloomberg, in June this year, the US Senate passed legislation setting out rules for dollar-linked cryptocurrencies, a move that has further legitimized stablecoins. As of 9 am local time on Friday (July 11), shares of Circle rose 4.4% to $209.57, marking a surge of over 500% since its listing. Although Ant International has denied reports of a partnership with Circle, its ambitions and active positioning in the stablecoin sector are undeniable. These moves underscore how traditional fintech giants are taking stablecoins seriously, particularly in the wake of the US Senate’s legislative push in June to regulate dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, which has accelerated mainstream acceptance of stablecoins.

Currently, there are 18 new fund offers of MFs waiting to be grabbed by investors, and this trend is likely to gain momentum, with new entrants in the asset management space launching NFOs in the next few months. In fact, in the last 10 days, five mutual fund houses have filed papers with SEBI to launch six NFOs. Interestingly, all of them are on the passive side and returns from these funds are linked to the movement of a particular index with no discretion of fund managers. Amid a volatile equity market and tepid returns from IPOs, investors have been lapping up NFOs. Markets embolden Trump on tariffs, stoking fear he’ll go too far Among the latest entrants, JioBlackRock AMC — a joint venture between Reliance Industries and global fund manager BlackRock — recently mopped up ₹17,800 crore through the launch of overnight, liquid and money market funds. The NFO witnessed participation from over 67,000 individual investors and more than 90 institutional investors. Buoyed by the tremendous response from investors, the digital-focused JioBlackRock AMC has filed draft documents to launch eight schemes, focusing on low-cost, direct-to-investor offerings. The JV aims to disrupt the ₹72 lakh crore fund management business in India with a minimum investment limit of ₹500. Additionally, new entrants in the MF space, such as Bajaj Finserv, Groww, Samco, Zerodha and CapitalMind have lined up NFOs to compete in the 47-member asset management business. The MF industry has raised ₹19,164 crore through the launch of 117 NFOs in the first six months of this year. Of this, 25 equity NFOs have mopped up ₹10,690 crore, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India. Venkat Chalasani, CEO, AMFI, said, “The launch of NFOs is expected to continue with the new entrants trying to make a space for themselves and the focus may be on the passive front to cater for the mass market.” Global markets: Asian shares up on Nvidia high, investors unfazed by Trump's tariff moves “Retail investors have reposed their faith in the MF industry by pouring into equity schemes consecutively for the last 52 months despite market volatility and geopolitical tensions,” he added. The MF industry has managed to attract investors’ interest despite the sharp increase in fundraising through initial public offerings. Swapnil Aggarwal, Director of VSRK Capital, said, “NFOs offer immediate diversification across multiple stocks and reduce single company risk. On the other hand, IPOs give direct ownership in a specific company, and investors’ returns depend on the financial performance of a single company,” he said. While all investors in NFOs get units at ₹10 a piece, there is no guarantee of allotment in IPOs, and bids can be placed only in specific lots, besides the IPO shares are allotted on a pro rata basis, he said. IPOs are best suited for investors with a higher risk appetite, while NFO offers a unique and compelling investment strategy that aligns with long-term gains, he said.

Title: I'm Done with Social Media
URL: https://www.carolinecrampton.com/im-done-with-social-media/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T15:00:36Z
Full Content:
I started last year with one clear goal: 2024 was going to be the year that I finally did social media. Regular posting, a content calendar, a strategy, a plan for growth — all of that. And yet I ended the year pretty certain that I never wanted to open those apps again, let alone post my photos and words to them. How? My main motivation for wanting to conquer my long-held ambivalence about posting was because I had a book coming out in April 2024. I was very anxious about this, in part because A Body Made of Glass was not an obviously easy sell. There are a few reasons for that: it blends several genres in a hard-to-categorise way, it tackles a subject in which I am not a well-known or previously published expert, and it is highly personal. It had also, in quite a modest way, done well according to the nebulous pre-publication benchmarks that authors obsess over. It had attracted a "Big Five" publisher in the US, something I had not had before, received a BBC radio serialisation deal in the UK, and had received some decent early reviews from industry publications in both places. I felt I should be leaving no stone unturned to support the book's success, since I had been gifted opportunities that many other writers would love to have. Chances, too, that I may never have again. There are very few things that an author can practically do to make a book a success, especially after said book is written, edited and printed. Being a celebrity or personality with a pre-existing audience that adores you definitely helps, but isn't something you can suddenly decide to become four months before your publication date. Catching a particular trend or moment that causes publishers to invest heavily in promotion and booksellers to place large early orders is great too, but once the book is done that's up to them, not you. Giving off that nebulous aura of "I'm about to become a huge literary success" that seems to cling to some people and not others would be good as well, but is also pretty hard to engineer deliberately if that's not your personality or presentation (and it isn't mine). In that tense, quiet period after the book has been finalised but before anyone can buy or read it, augmenting your personal brand via the regular use of social media feels like the only concrete action you can take. Or at least it did to me, so I threw myself into it. I attended some training sessions on "social media for authors". I asked professional acquaintances with expertise for tips. I learned that Instagram and TikTok were the best platforms to target for bookish followers and that the algorithms of these platforms were, these days, only interested in vertical videos. I compiled lists of videos I could make and started filming mostly-daily updates about my experience as an author with a book coming out soon. I scoured the accounts of other authors who were more successful than me on social media for insights. I posted about every tiny bit of publicity my book got or small win I achieved. I asked people to pre-order in as many ways as I could think of. I delved into the analytics, searching for ways to optimise and improve. I spent a lot of time scrolling, and scrolling, and scrolling, hunting for the "one weird trick" that would help me make a success of this. I quickly began to feel quite uncomfortable. I'm not a natural on camera and I don't have that talent for talking effortlessly and engagingly to a lens when alone in a room that successful social media personalities need. I was forcing it all the time, making myself record multiple takes and doing things again and again until they looked "natural" (a highly unnatural behaviour). My video editing skills are basic, so turning out regular videos took me a long time. Worst of all, though, was the way in which this enterprise began to alter my mindset about the normal stuff of life. I never used to think very hard about what I wore for a casual day of writing at home, or worry about how clean the bathroom mirror was, or obsess over what narrative or story might emerge from my general jumble of accumulated tasks. It shocked me how quickly I started viewing my own life as something to film and share, rather than something to just... live. I've seen this effect described as "the devil had taken my eyes" and I feel that is accurate. Something had taken over my gaze and it wasn't something good. A new and sinister lens had appeared between me and the world. One evening, as I made my husband walk our dog past the same scenic view multiple times so that I could get the best shot of it for a video, I experienced a sudden wave of revulsion for myself and what I was doing. From then on, I began to despise the way this supposedly necessary aspect of modern authorship was intruding on parts of me that I had never meant to be available for public consumption. Worst of all, perhaps, it didn't even seem to be doing anything. The TikTok and Instagram algorithms were utterly disinterested in what I was posting. Some of my existing followers saw my videos and interacted with them, but the promise that this kind of regular video posting would expose my work to lots of new potential readers was never fulfilled. Instagram's analytics showed that although I had a couple of thousand followers, only a few hundred of them were even seeing what I was posting. On Twitter, where I had nearly ten thousand followers that had mostly been accumulated during my previous work as a political journalist, the figures were even worse. Most of my TikToks barely made it to views in three figures. Clearly, I was doing it wrong. But how? I couldn't find any answers, although there's a seemingly inexhaustible supply of information out there on this topic. Everyone in this space seemed to publicly agree that "social media was really important for book promotion" and pointed to the viral success of various books on BookTok, but nobody was able to go into more detail about how this was achieved, or if it was even applicable to a non-fiction book by a non-celebrity author. When I tried to explore this world, it seemed to me like the old-fashioned word-of-mouth effect was just being channeled through a new medium. Books mostly weren't gaining momentum on TikTok because their authors were making top notch viral videos, but because readers and bookish influencers were recommending them to each other and posting about their experiences. It was the quality of the book, the canny distribution of advance reading copies and marketing materials by publishers, and the work's ability to speak to a moment that made the difference. I didn't really see how my own social media activities could fit into this ecosystem. People would either find and like the book, or they wouldn't. Did I even need to be there? Every time I posted, I felt worse. From the outside, my attempts to "do" social media seriously probably looked inconsequential, but they consumed a major portion of my thoughts. What I was doing felt inauthentic and, as the book came out and started getting reviews, like boasting for no reason other than to boast. The choppy nature of the algorithms meant that there was no consistent community on these apps with whom I was sharing my progress through the publishing process and no guarantee even that those were interested would see what I was sharing. When I did in-person events about the book and spoke to readers over the signing table, they would tell me that they had come because they had liked my first book, or enjoyed my current podcast, Shedunnit, or had been a fan of my old one, SRSLY. One person drove several hours to see me at a literary festival because I had put a link to the event in a postscript in my sporadic email newsletter. Nobody I met had been motivated by what I had been doing on social media, even though making those posts had been consuming the vast majority of the time and effort I had to devote to book promotion. This is anecdotal data, for sure, but so much of how the success or otherwise of a book is defined is vibes-based that I felt fine about allowing it to inform me. It only backed up what the social media platforms' analytics had been telling me, anyway. By the mid point of last year my book had been out for a couple of months and the expectation to market it as much as possible was dying away. My anxiety simmered down to the point where I could assess matters more objectively. This was situation as I saw it: I had put a lot of work time and mental energy into social media because I had been told by lots of trustworthy sources — like people who worked in publishing, fellow authors and my writers' union — that it was the best way to help my book reach as many interested readers as possible. In fact, my posts had reached very few people and contributed very little to the success of the book. Plus, they were very time consuming to make so had eaten up leisure time and my capacity to do other work. There had also been negative side effects in the form of vastly increased screen time and that disagreeable mental habit of seeing my entire existence as potential posts. There was only one possible conclusion: social media was not for me. More than that, I felt that there was something of an "emperor's new clothes" situation at work. Being a social media star is a skillset completely distinct from being someone who writes books — they may overlap occasionally, but it's not the norm. Yet I suspect that every non-celebrity and midlist author will have felt the pressure at some point to "be more active on social media" because otherwise they aren't "pulling their weight" for their book. I wasn't alone in finding that the effort:reward ratio was entirely out of whack, either. Plenty of peers that I spoke to with online creative businesses were happy to share their experiences of withdrawing partially or fully from social media (for all sorts of reasons including harassment, burnout and parenting) only to find that their sales were largely or even entirely unaffected the next time they had a project to promote. One had closed an account with a following in the six figures and switched to communicating with customers only via an email newsletter, and business was even better than before (likely because all of those subscribed were actually receiving the emails they had signed up for). I began to wonder. Was this all, in fact, nonsense? The publishing industry is going through a period of great volatility at the moment, for many reasons including but not limited to rising production costs, encroaching celebrity culture, corporate greed and the advent of AI. Traditional publicity opportunities like television/radio interviews and print reviews are becoming less and less effective at getting the word out about books as fewer people tune in. The digital alternatives have, so far, not offered a like for like replacement for the old marketing ecosystem. From my perspective as a traditionally-published, non-celebrity author, it feels like nobody really knows what makes a book sell anymore. I think the persistent advice to authors to "do social media" is, at best, part of a strategy that can be generously described as throwing everything at the proverbial wall in the hope that something, anything, will stick. Being more cynical, I think it might sometimes be a way of keeping authors quiet, of transferring the responsibility for their book's success on to their shoulders and occupying them doing something that feels productive so they don't ask too many awkward questions. It's busy work. That's all without considering the role of the platforms themselves in this. I spent several months last year feeling grim about the amount of free content I had uploaded to platforms owned by the likes of Meta and Elon Musk. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok — these are all outlets that purport to capture and manipulate their users' attention, meaning that, as a "creator", if you catch the wave of the algorithm just right you can surf it all the way to a huge following, then fame and fortune. I don't doubt that the select few who make this equation work for them do get well paid for their work once they become successful. Everyone else, though, is just uploading for free so that there is enough stuff on the app to keep users scrolling forever. Infinite scroll means infinite ad inventory. The platforms also invest in promoting the idea that being a "full time creator" is an attainable goal and incentivise their top creators to sell the idea that anyone can achieve their success, if they just start now and work really hard for nothing as long as is necessary. The more I thought about it, the harder it became not to view the so-called creator economy as a blatant pyramid scheme underwritten by some of the worst corporations in the world. The way to succeed is to get in early, then become an aspirational figure to those who come along later. I'm being deliberately blunt to make my point. If you enjoy watching happy videos of dogs and uploading pictures of your holidays for your friends, I'm delighted for you. If making videos and sharing them online is your hobby, all power to you. As part of a viable creative career, though, where a living wage and sustainable workload is the goal, social media now feels to me like a long con that just hasn't been exposed yet. I've never been a whole-hearted lover of social media, nor a great adept at it. I only signed up for Facebook at university because it was necessary for being involved in the student newspaper, and then I deleted my account a few years later when I had a scary experience with a stalker. I rejoined when I moved out of London, naively believing it would help me make new local friends, which it did not. I got Twitter when someone on my journalism training course laughed at me because I didn't already have an account and then almost never posted on it, even when the platform was at its dizzying heights of relevance for those in the media. I once went mildly viral for a snarky tweet during a televised election debate and found the experience so horrifying that I never wanted to repeat it. Instagram was better, for a while — my corner of it was mostly friends and dogs and knitting — but then the feed became algorithmic instead of chronological and I almost never saw the things I liked in a sensible order. Social media was never a wholly cosy or useful place for me, although I was utterly addicted to it for a number of years because "being a journalist" in the 2010s felt synonymous with "being on social media all the time". This idea was so deeply rooted in me that when I worked somewhere with such terrible computers that they couldn't even handle refreshing a Twitter feed, I bought an iPad with my own money so that I could have a device next to me all day that was continually showing the latest posts. At the time, I barely made more than the London Living Wage, rent took three quarters of my monthly pay after tax, and I walked an hour to work every day because I couldn't afford to take the Tube. In those circumstances, buying an expensive tablet just so I never had to be separated from the latest tweets is absurd, even irresponsible. And yet I did it, because I had utterly internalised the idea that social media was the route to writing success. Years later, even knowing what I now knew, it took months to work myself up to quitting and even longer to say out loud what I had done and why. Once I had made up my mind to mentally uncouple myself from social media, it was shockingly easy to do. I deleted the apps from my phone and changed the passwords to my accounts, recording them somewhere inconvenient so that I could log in via the desktop versions if necessary but it took more than a couple of taps or clicks. A few weeks in, I took stock of what I felt like I was missing and the list was surprisingly short: Taylor Swift content, chats with friends, the occasional funny picture of a dog. I replaced all of these pretty easily: I signed up to a couple of music podcasts and Patreons, made an effort to be more regular about phoning and texting people, and just enjoyed the dogs that I saw out and about in the world. The benefits were just as quick to come. That feeling of seeing the world only as potential future content receded, I started reading more books, and my screen time fell drastically. I felt released from a burden I hadn't noticed I was carrying. I had become so accustomed to the sense of shame at not being better at offering up my life for successful consumption that I only realised how acute that feeling had been now that it was gone. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, for someone very influential in my industry to swoop down and reprimand me for my actions, to declare that I had irrevocably failed at "being a writer". But nothing bad happened. At all. Those apps had become so barren of joy or purpose for me that I didn't miss the experience of being on them, either as a creator or a user, at all. By the end of the year, packaging chunks of myself to share on questionable corporate platforms for strangers to watch and judge felt like a really weird thing to do. I talked about it in therapy and imagined trying to explain this practice to my eleven-year-old self who had really wanted to spend her life writing stories. The more time that passes, the odder it feels that I spent a decade and a half of my life believing that social media was a vital part of being a writer. Others may have different experiences, but because I was never a consummate poster I never received work opportunities or made friends or found a partner through these apps. Maybe if I had, I would feel like there had been more of a fair exchange. I just allowed them to occupy a large chunk of my brain for nothing. Where does this leave me? I ended 2024 absolutely sure that social media was not for me, a complete reversal of my position at the start of the year. I'm not moving to the woods and throwing my phone in the bin, though. Beyond the reassuringly steady drip of Taylor Swift videos, there was one overarching benefit to being active on social media as a writer that I want to retain, and that is having a way to be in touch with those who are interested in my work. I've spent most of 2025 so far working out what that might look like. I still like the internet and what it can do for us — quite honestly, I don't think I would have a job at all without it — but I want to use it on my terms and in a way that feels good for me rather than harmful. If that means that my potential audience is much smaller, so be it. After much reflection during, I have come to realise that I'd rather talk to a small number of people and be happy doing it than try to reach a huge audience but be miserable. I started small, making the change for my podcast. I did a "farewell" post on the show's accounts and replaced them with an enhanced email newsletter. I expected some pushback and braced myself for a dip in listenership, which I decided that I was willing to accept as the price I paid for independence and greater peace of mind. Neither materialised. I received lots of supportive messages from people with their own growing reservations about social media. The podcast's newsletter now has more active subscribers than we ever had followers. There has been no discernible fall in audience, vindicating my suspicions that our posts hadn't really been doing anything to direct people away from the apps and towards the podcast anyway. Best of all, I'm enjoying writing to the podcast's listeners every week. I am no longer guiltily pushing the "do podcast social media" tasks to the bottom of my to do list all the time. Taking this step for the podcast first has allowed me to come to some decisions about my personal internet presence, too. I have realised that I only want to post on a platform where I have control, with no algorithms or anything else coming between me and the people who want to see what I'm doing. I'm a writer and I think in paragraphs and chapters, not in videos or captions. I think it's about time I played to my strengths, rather than trying to fit myself into a format that I've never found to be comfortable. So, I decided to add a blog to my website and that will now be my home on the internet[1]. I gave it a tagline that hopefully reflects this new stage of my online life: "A blog by a writer attempting to live the literary good life on the internet". Because that's what I'm trying to do now. The quality of the life now is more important than any potential reward in the future. Although the blog will be the main home for all my stuff (you can follow it via RSS and I think you should, because RSS is possibly the best and purest tech we still have) I'll still be sending some posts out as newsletters too. Personal essays where I think out loud (like this one), my Thursday links round up, reading reflections, and a new series I'm about to start titled "Caroline Writes a Novel" (!). Because lots of people have been in touch to say they miss the photos of my dog I used to post on Instagram, there will be a sporadic "photo diary" mail out too where Morris will feature heavily. If you'd like to receive those you can sign up here, or if you already subscribe you can use this menu to adjust which types of posts you receive. I have no plans at the moment to put up a paywall or make extra premium content, but I do have the subscription feature turned on so if anyone really wants to make a financial contribution, they can. I must stress that you won't receive any extra material or benefits if you do so. For now, this is a Medici-style "patron of the arts" situation. Everything is free for everyone, supported by those who have the means and desire to do so. I also want to stress that I absolutely do not need your contributions for basic necessities or survival — this is just a way for those who can to support work that they like if they so choose. There's also an option for a one-off tip if you feel inclined to give one. You should feel no pressure or obligation to do so, though. If you're more into a "extra content for a fee" model, then you might want to consider joining the paid membership element of my podcast. If all of this — a non-famous writer with a podcast deciding she's replacing Instagram with blogging — feels too inconsequential to write 4,500 words about, then you're not alone. I think so too, but I also couldn't not write this. In fact, I've been tapping away at a draft of this post for months, trying to get my feelings about it straight. I might be well on the way to breaking the habit of reflexively viewing the world around me as possible nuggets of content, but even after the somewhat bruising experience of putting out two autobiographical books, I still think best with my fingers on a keyboard and a publication date in mind. In this instance, I do feel like I'm answering a question nobody has asked, though. I think quite regularly about the, at the time very funny, ebook that Grace Dent published in 2011 titled How to Leave Twitter: My Time as Queen of the Universe and Why This Must Stop, in which she lampooned her own social media addiction and the absurd phenomenon of too-online people with tiny followings grandiloquently announcing that they wouldn't be online for the next three hours. What is this, if not that? It feels fitting, though, to mark the end of this chapter in a needlessly performative way. Even though I was terrible at posting, I did spend fifteen years watching human behaviour evolve on these platforms. It was bound to rub off on me a bit. I still don't know if I will delete my old social media accounts. I want to, because it feels more final that way, more like a definitive statement about who I am now and what I am doing. Maybe that's why I shouldn't, though. That was a version of me too, the one who agonised over every angle and caption, who couldn't see the light hitting the water just so without imagining Instagram's square frame around it, who believed that all her dreams would come true if she could just crack Meta's code. She was trying her best, just like I am now. She can live on as a ghost in that machine for now, a bodiless reminder of an existence I never really had. For those who might be wondering why I'm not starting a Substack, it's because I don't like Substack as a company or the direction their platform seems to be headed in (I was there for Facebook's "pivot to video" and I remember who it screwed over). I'm using Ghost, a non-profit website and newsletter platform, and I'm very happy with it. I'd highly recommend it. ↩︎

Title: Bitcoin – How $1.18B in ETF inflows could push BTC’s price higher

Selling pressure from miners increased slightly as BTC hit a new ATH. Bitcoin [BTC] has hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $118k on the backdrop of strong ETF inflows and demand from treasury firms. On the 10th of July, U.S. spot ETFs attracted $1.18 billion in daily inflow, bringing monthly demand to $2.3 billion. In fact, that was the second-largest daily inflow since the products debuted in January 2024. Analytics firm Ecoinometrics said that the strong ETF demand could push BTC to $119K, citing its proprietary model data. Source: Ecoinometrics/X At the time of its post, BTC hovered at around $112K, and soon afterward, the asset extended its rally to $118.8K. The analytics firm said, “Bitcoin is already at an all-time high, and the macro backdrop is shifting into a full risk-on regime.” As expected, BlackRock’s IBIT led the Thursday demand, commanding nearly half of the inflows ($448.5 million). Fidelity’s FBTC followed closely at $324.34 million. Overall, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF recorded $5 billion in trading volume on the 10th of July, following $3.5 billion the day before, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The analyst projected that ETFs would likely hit a billion-dollar flow on Thursday and Friday. “When IBIT sees big volume surges on up price days it portends big boy flows (as seen in chart) = good chance we see $1b in flows over next two days. It’s also a hair away from $80b.” Source: Eric Balchunas/X As of press time, the first $1 billion flow had already been hit. If Friday’s session (July 11) rake in another $1 billion in ETF inflows, then BTC could likely tag $120K or zoom above it. The Options market data showed that the highest volume by strike for calls (bullish bets) was parked at $130K, $120K and $125K. These suggested that bulls were betting that BTC could extend the rally and hit these levels. Source: CoinGlass At the same time, the downside risk positioning showed that most puts (red, bearish bets) were piled at $102K and $100K. In other words, institutional players expected a floor price of $100K, meaning they viewed the level as the new support. Despite the bullish structure, there appeared to be one caveat worth tracking. CryptoQuant reported that the new ATH high had triggered miners to book profit, as indicated by the spike in Miner Position Index (MPI). Source: CryptoQuant While the metric’s reading was at 0.6 at the time of writing, an extended jump to 2 would mean a heightened miner sell-off. A similar move marked a local top back in May, and could be crucial to track.

Title: Job anxiety has workers misreading everyday signals

Good morning. It's the last day of Amazon's Prime Day sale, so time is running out to snag some of the best deals of the summer. The Reviews team at BI has gathered the best discounts for your home, kitchen, closet, and more — and they've tested all the items, too. In today's big story, welcome to the age of office paranoia, where layoffs, AI, and job insecurity are terrorizing workers. What's on deck: Markets: JPMorgan says retail investors will lead a stock-buying spree in the second half of 2025. Tech: A new city is vying to steal San Francisco's Big Tech crown. Business: Dear Starbucks, please don't force baristas to write on cups. But first, we need to talk. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. They think they're next. The company snacks are worse. The office air conditioning goes out. An unexpected meeting appeared on your calendar. The signs all point toward one thing: looming layoffs. Or not. Sometimes, things are just as mundane as they appear. It's what experts call "paranoid attribution," when employees read negative meaning into regular workplace occurrences. It's occurring in workforces across America. It's not hard to understand why: AI is threatening to take jobs, strict RTO orders are becoming more common, and the Great Flattening is coming for middle management. "Workers are feeling disempowered," said Michele Williams, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at the University of Iowa. "They're looking for these social cues and overinterpreting social cues because of that insecurity." Meanwhile, the reality is that layoff rates are still low — relative to historic levels — and remain concentrated in white-collar sectors, especially at big-name companies that dominate headlines. In other words, things may not be as bad as they seem. But the paranoia is still reshaping the workplace. The fear isn't good for anyone, BI's Juliana Kaplan writes. When employees are anxious about their career security, they probably aren't doing their best work. One worker that BI spoke with has completely changed her perspective on her career after getting laid off twice in two years. The first time was the day that she had arranged a return-to-office party for the workers reporting to her. "It's really hard to go to work every day and to know that you may not have a future here no matter how hard you work," she said. On the other hand, fear can be terribly efficient. When companies shift toward a more "hardcore" management style, they are generally banking on employees clinging to well-worn adages about becoming indispensable at work. Employees were supposed to become hyper-focused, not hyper-concerned. Now, staffers are looking at the corporate world a little differently — and some are turning their back on it altogether. Last chance of the year to observe "Manhattanhenge," when the sun sets in perfect alignment with the Manhattan street grid. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Title: TikTok poached Amazon employees to jump-start its US business. Now it's doubling down on its Chinese roots.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-hired-amazon-staff-for-shop-pivots-back-to-china-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-07-11T14:48:26Z
Full Content:
"Always day 1" is one of six core cultural principles at TikTok. The slogan, meant to inspire agility and urgency, might sound familiar. It was coined by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Business principles aren't the only thing TikTok has taken from Amazon. When TikTok officially launched its e-commerce platform Shop in the US in 2023, it went on a hiring spree, poaching dozens of Amazon staffers to work in its Bellevue, Washington, offices, located a few blocks from some Amazon offices. By the end of 2024, TikTok had 1,700 employees there, according to the city's estimates. So many TikTok Shop employees came from Amazon that its early staff meetings sometimes felt like Amazon alumni reunions, current and former staffers told Business Insider. "It was Amazon left, right, and center," said one employee who came from Amazon. Another ex-Amazonian estimated that 75% of their 2023 TikTok Shop orientation group had previously worked at the e-commerce giant. Amazon showed up in operations, too. TikTok team members routinely shared insights about Amazon's business strategies, sometimes walking through documents taken directly from their former employer, two current staffers and one former TikTok staffer said. And just like at Amazon, employees crafted narrative memos to share products or ideas and allocated dedicated time for people to read them. Some tried to infuse TikTok with other Amazon strategies like customer obsession or single-person ownership of projects from start to finish. TikTok didn't want to be exactly like Amazon — its secret sauce was its social app with popular videos and an influencer network. But it really wanted Amazon's brand partners, and to replicate the customer shopping experience that had turned Amazon into a $2 trillion behemoth. Amazon controls about 40% of the total US e-commerce market, which could cross $100 billion in 2026, according to EMARKETER. If TikTok could peel away even a small percentage of customers, the opportunity would be huge. In some ways, TikTok never fully embraced a local-first approach to the US market. Despite hiring so many people in the US, its key e-commerce leaders continued to largely direct the business from China and Singapore. Then, last year, the US team began to fall short of its goals. Chinese leadership at ByteDance, TikTok's owner, began stripping some US executives' autonomy through changes to their reporting structures. A parade of US team managers left the company, and in their place, TikTok's parent company installed new leaders who weren't tapped into the Amazon playbook. Gone are the days of draining knowledge from America's most iconic e-commerce retailer. TikTok Shop leaders are focused on a different North Star: its Chinese sister app, Douyin. The changes on the Shop team mirror a broader shift within TikTok, which, even as it seeks an American buyer, has given more strategic power to leaders from China and Singapore. Some TikTok insiders feel the shift was inevitable. ByteDance leaders "weren't willing to listen to what strategies worked for Amazon that were relevant for TikTok," a former Shop staffer who worked with sellers said. They said leaders had a fixation on livestream selling — a big sales driver in China that did not translate as successfully to the US market. Leadership wanted "US representation and experience, but they didn't want to take a US strategy," this person continued. "It was a constant struggle between 'copy Amazon' and 'copy Douyin,'" a second former Shop worker said. TikTok and Amazon did not provide comment on this story. In 2023, TikTok recruited Nicolas Le Bourgeois, a nine-year Amazon veteran, to run TikTok Shop's US operations. Other Amazonians soon joined TikTok to boost sales in key product categories and staff roles like seller relationships, trust and safety, governance, operations, and logistics. Like Amazon, TikTok launched its own "Fulfilled by TikTok" business in 2023. It pushed sellers to ship products to US customers faster and established six US warehouses by October 2024, Le Bourgeois told BI last year. Amazon wasn't the only company where TikTok Shop sourced talent, but it was a big focus. The company hired people who had relationships with "US brands, heritage brands, household names, because they wanted us to basically convince those brands to get on platform," the former staffer who worked with sellers said. Some team members studied Amazon's product pages, its checkout process, and other core elements of its shopping experience. By early 2024, TikTok seemed to be making progress. Despite some users grumbling about seeing too many e-commerce videos, it was making strides in key metrics like customer retention. Some brands were reporting seven-figure hauls from TikTok Shop livestreams. But executives at ByteDance weren't happy. The app's sales were minuscule compared to Douyin, a dominant player in China that drives hundreds of billions in annual sales there. Bob Kang, ByteDance's e-commerce leader, called out the US team for missing 2024 goals in a February 2025 all-hands. The company was struggling with recruiting those "household name" brands in some product categories, and instead finding a lot more success with smaller sellers, often based out of China. ByteDance leadership began removing power from local US leaders in 2024, current and former staffers said. Then came a series of restructurings, two rounds of layoffs, and review-cycle exits over the first half of 2025. Many of the early ex-Amazon workers exited, replaced by executives with expertise working on Douyin. In April, Le Bourgeois was moved under former Douyin executive Mu Qing, no longer reporting directly to Kang. The next month, Le Bourgeois left the company, according to an internal memo viewed by BI. Le Bourgeois did not respond to a request for comment. With Le Bourgeois gone, one staffer said it's become harder for US employees to communicate with ByteDance leadership. ByteDance leaders are now betting TikTok Shop's future on leaders with Douyin expertise. Douyin's e-commerce business is a crown jewel for ByteDance, and replicating its strategies in the US and other markets could pay off big if the rest of the world follows Chinese consumers in embracing social shopping. As TikTok Shop expands into additional markets, it's running many operations centrally out of China and Singapore. In April, the company heavily restructured its moderation team in Latin America to give control to Chinese and Singaporean leaders rather than local managers, according to an internal memo viewed by BI. In May, it flew Chinese staffers to São Paulo to support the rollout of TikTok Shop in Brazil. The company's swing back to its Chinese roots in the US may seem counterintuitive, as TikTok's ties to China prompted a 2024 US law that requires it to divest from its owner. But TikTok does not appear to be under imminent danger of shutting down; Trump has extended its divestment deadline three times since January. And TikTok may soon separate its US users into a country-specific app, The Information reported. The road ahead for TikTok Shop, as it faces business and political obstacles, will require embodying the "always day 1" agility the company lists as a core principle. After months of leadership changes, TikTok Shop is grappling with volatile sales in 2025 amid Trump's tariffs on China and the removal of a key import exemption, BI previously reported. While weekly order volume slumped in May compared to April after tariffs went into effect, the company wrote in a blog post last month that platform sales were up 120% year-over-year for the first two weeks of June. ByteDance is betting it can meet its e-commerce ambitions by leaning heavily on the expertise that made Douyin a leader in China. Some insiders say this could risk missing the US market nuances that local e-commerce workers might more easily spot. In many ways, they never committed to a local US strategy, the third staffer said. "It has always been 'rebuild Douyin' for the western market." Jump to

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: AMD Stock Popped After Analyst Said New AI Chips Could Take On Nvidia’s—Watch These Key Price Levels

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock jumped Thursday after analysts suggested the company’s latest AI chips could take on Nvidia's (NVDA) offerings. Analysts at HSBC said AMD’s MI350 series chips are comparable with Nvidia’s current Blackwell chips and next generation MI400 chips, due for release next year, could compete with Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin platform. AMD shares trade 86% above their early April low and have gained 18% since the start of the year as of Thursday’s close. However, they have significantly unperformed Nvidia’s shares over the past 12 months due to the company’s inability to capture a greater share of the booming AI chip market. Below, we take a closer look at AMD’s chart and use technical analysis to identify crucial price levels that investors should keep an eye on. Since bottoming in early April, AMD shares have traded higher in an orderly uptrend. More recently, the price broke out from a flag pattern in Thursday’s trading session on the highest volume in a little over a week, potentially signaling a continuation of the stock’s recent move higher. In another win for the bulls, the 50-day moving average (MA) continues to converge up toward the 200-day MA, setting the stage for a golden cross signal. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum, sitting just below the indicator’s overbought threshold. Let’s identify two crucial overhead areas on AMD’s chart that could attract interest if the shares continue to track higher and also locate several vital support levels worth monitoring during future pullbacks in the stock. The first overhead area to watch sits around $175. This price point could provide resistance near prominent countertrend peaks that formed on the chart in May and October last year. This level is also near a bars pattern target that preceded the flag and overlays it from the pattern’s breakout point. Such a move would complete a classic Elliot Wave pattern, with five distinct swings playing out. Buying above this area could see the shares climb towards $215. Investors who have accumulated the stock at lower prices may decide to lock in profits at this level just below the stock’s notable March 2024 top marked by a textbook shooting star candlestick pattern. During pullbacks in the stock, it’s initially worth monitoring the $135 level. The shares could find solid buying interest at this price near the low of the flag pattern, which sits on a horizontal line extending back to last September. Finally, a deeper retracement in AMD shares could see the price revisit a lower support around $115. Investors may seek entry points in this area near a trendline that connects a range of peaks and troughs that developed on the chart between January and June.

Title: Ex-garda jailed for 20 months for attacking ex-partner

A man has been jailed for 20 months for attacking and threatening to kill his then partner in their home at a time when he was a serving garda. Ian Gillen of Carysfort Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin was before Dublin Circuit Criminal Court today, where he pleaded guilty to threatening to kill or cause serious harm to Jennifer Clinton on 23 December 2021, at Trafalgar Lane, Monkstown, and to assaulting Ms Clinton on the same occasion. After hearing facts in the case yesterday, Judge Martin Nolan adjourned the case overnight. Today, Judge Nolan said the custody threshold had been crossed in this case, noting that he had considered the facts of the case, Gillen's circumstances and mitigation. He imposed a prison sentence of four years, with the final 28 months suspended on strict conditions due to the substantial mitigation and the tragedy in Gillen's life. Inspector Rachael Kilpatrick testified yesterday that the couple had socialised together that evening in Blackrock Tennis and Bowling Club, where they were members. They had gone home separately, with Ms Clinton arriving home first. Ms Clinton told gardaí that when Gillen arrived home, he called her downstairs to sit on a pouffe by the fireside, where he stood over her in an intimidating manner, rebuking her and calling her names. "Jen, I'm going to rip your head off," he had said, putting her in fear, and prompting her to make an audio recording of the rest of the incident on her mobile phone, should she not survive. He punched her with a closed fist three times on top of her head. In an effort to get away, she said she needed to go to the toilet, but he refused to let her go. She eventually managed to go, locked the bathroom door behind her, and cleared the windowsill so she’d have a route out. She eventually made her way out of the house. She had managed to record 40 minutes of the threats. An attempt was made to play this in court, but it was not possible due to technical difficulties. A transcript of the recording was handed to the judge instead. Ms Clinton described Gillen’s conduct as pure anger. She said that any time she tried to get up, he kept telling her to sit back down. "You’re going to die tonight," he told her three times. He also said that he was going to die that night, and she believed her life was in serious danger. After she escaped, Gillen was arrested for coercive control, was interviewed, and the recording was played to him. He was embarrassed and said it wasn’t in him to hit her, but indicated it was another person in his body. "He was shocked by his own behaviour," said Inspector Kilpatrick. Gillen accepted that he could snap and be angry with drink. He said he had issues in his background, including the death of his son, which caused him to drink. He has since retired and has no previous convictions.

She accepted that it was in the line of duty that he had to deal with his son taking his own life in his early 20s. Gillen was the first responder on the scene. His mental health deteriorated, and he relied on alcohol. Ms Clinton entered the witness box to deliver an emotional victim impact statement, having to take a break to dry her tears at one stage. She said that her life had been marked by fear and deep trauma since the prolonged assault, when she felt overpowered and trapped. She said she still lived with the consequences every day, having been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression. "I live in a state of hypervigilance," she said. "I lost my confidence. The memory of that night is etched into my mind and body like the cross he etched into the front door of our shared home one night in a rage." She said that Gillen's rising aggression while they socialised in the club that evening was what had prompted her to leave, but that he had then arrived home full of fury. "I wanted my family to know the truth if I did not survive," she said, referring to the 40 minutes of the assault that she captured on her phone. "I’m the biggest white psychopath you’ll ever meet," he had told her. At one point, Gillen mockingly suggested that she ring Blackrock Garda Station, insinuating that nobody would help her if she did, because he was a serving garda. Ms Clinton said that she had to work out how she would escape from the home, where she had previously felt safe. "I thought of my children and grandchildren and made a break for it. I still have recurring nightmares where I did not get out," she explained. "Living with him took a deep emotional toll. I felt smaller and smaller all the time," she said. "The man I once loved became someone I feared." She said that she was in a state of heartbreak and vulnerability when he attacked her, having lost her sister, her mother, her best friend, as well as Gillen’s son, Cathal. "I’m not the person I was before this happened to me," she continued. She said that the horror of that night still affected and echoed through the lives of those she loved. "As a longstanding member of An Garda Síochána, he would present himself as a figure, someone to be believed and relied upon to uphold common decency and morality," she said. She said she had not included the most appalling part of what he had said about being a garda, but that they were in the recording. However, she said that he did not tarnish the reputation of An Garda Síochána, but just of himself. "I’m here for justice," she said, asking the court to take into account the enduring horror Gillen had caused. Kathleen Leader SC, defending, handed the court two testimonials and a psychologist’s report on behalf of her client, who she said was a deeply ashamed man and apologised for what he had put Ms Clinton through. She said he had faced a number of traumatic incidents in his 40 years with the force. They had taken their toll on him and probably hadn’t been dealt with as they should have been. She described the death of his son in the very recent past, while Gillen was on duty, as every guard’s and parent’s worst nightmare, and asked the court to take it into account. She said that he had retired from the gardaí on medical grounds. Counsel explained that Gillen was a former senior international bowler and a member of Blackrock Bowling Club, while his son had been involved in Cabinteely Soccer Club. He now works to prevent suicide through these clubs. "He has become involved as a person to speak to about mental health issues," she said. His two referees were in court to support him, she said, with one crediting her client with saving his life and the other saying that he had helped him in the prevention of suicide. "He was enduring a very traumatic event at the time," she said. "It was an out-of-character incident." She said that her client attends his GP and a psychiatrist, who told him that he was dealing with his trauma appropriately by helping others. Ms Leader quoted the psychologist’s report as saying Gillen was at a low risk of domestic violence in future, provided things are maintained as they are. "This was a man who was stressed at the time for very good reason, not appropriately dealing with the stress," she said. Passing sentence, Judge Martin Nolan said: "It seems only he knows why he attacked her. He beat her over a period of time and slapped her and made very serious threats that were believable. "This injured party was terrified, and she eventually made her escape." Judge Nolan said the background to this case is that this defendant is a retired member of An Garda Síochána. He said Gillen was a frontline garda who had to "make difficult decisions, and this can have an effect on a person". He also noted that Gillen was "visited with a tragic event with the death of his son, which must have affected him". He said there was a report before the court which outlined how this tragic incident impacted the defendant. The judge said the mitigation in this case is clear, that Gillen entered a guilty plea, there was a general level of cooperation, he has no record of conviction, and he has a good work history, all of which the court must acknowledge. Judge Nolan said: "I believe that he has crossed the custody threshold", noting that this is a very serious matter. "I don’t know what was going through his mind on that night," he said. Judge Nolan sentenced Gillen to four years in prison, but due to the substantial mitigation and the tragedy in his life, he suspended the final 28 months. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Proxy voting giants investigated by Missouri AG for misleading clients about their DEI and ESG priorities

Fox News Digital spoke to Utah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks at the State Financial Officers Foundation conference in Orlando, Florida FIRST ON FOX: Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey launched parallel investigations this week into two of the nation's leading proxy advisory companies, alleging they have abdicated their fiduciary duties and violated state consumer protection laws by misleading consumers about their prioritization of ideology over investor returns. Bailey argued in civil investigative demands sent to Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) that they are violating state consumer protection law by assuring their customers that their proxy voting recommendations are based solely on data and research – and are entirely neutral. But, simultaneously, Bailey argues that publicly available documents from the firms show that their proxy voting recommendations are designed to advance DEI and environmental causes regardless of whether they undermine investor returns. Glass Lewis and ISS are two foreign-owned powerhouses that control roughly 97% of the U.S. proxy advisory market, according to an April report from the House Financial Services Committee. The firms specialize in providing voting recommendations to institutional investors – such as pension funds, retirement systems and mutual funds – on how to vote during corporate shareholder meetings. These votes frequently include decisions related to board member elections, executive compensation, company policies and other proposals. BLACKROCK ADDS NEW PROXY ADVISORY FIRM AMID ESG CRITICISM AS LEADING EXPERT SAYS ‘TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE’ Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is accusing two major proxy advisory firms of misleading consumers by hiding their prioritization of DEI and ESG policies, even at the cost of investor returns. (iStock; Getty Images) "Missourians deserve answers as to why the unseen power brokers, controlling much of corporate America, are pushing a leftist worldview at the expense of millions of honest investors," Bailey said. "These are foreign-owned actors manipulating the U.S. economy, and we will not let them thrive any longer. We are going after the source. These proxy advisors have held corporate America hostage with their radical ideologies. We are putting them on notice: Missouri will not tolerate ideological coercion disguised as investment guidance." In an enforcement petition Bailey sent to the state circuit court in an effort to compel the companies' compliance with the new probes, the attorney general points to statements on both ISS and Glass Lewis's websites, respectively, that insist they provide "objective and impartial offerings" that are "based on research and data." At the same time, Bailey points to internal company documents, such as a document titled "2025 Benchmark Policy Guidelines" from Glass Lewis, which includes numerous sections on the importance of advancing DEI and ESG causes. "This means that Glass Lewis’s statement that it provides ‘research and data’ that allows its customers to ‘make informed investment decisions’ is false," Bailey wrote in his enforcement petition against Glass Lewis. SEVERAL STATE OFFICIALS DEMAND FEDS PROTECT AMERICANS' RETIREMENT PLANS BY CLEARLY REGULATING ESG INVESTMENTS Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey addresses members of the press in the old post office building in Downtown St. Louis on Thursday, Feb. 2, 2024. (Vanessa Abbitt/St. Louis Post-Dispatch/Tribune News Service via Getty Images ) Similarly, at ISS, Bailey points to company statements claiming it provides customers with "objective and impartial offerings," while simultaneously producing internal company reports that include commitments to recommending votes in favor of proposals "calling for the reduction of [greenhouse gas] emissions." In addition to allegedly misleading consumers about their company priorities, Bailey is accusing Glass Lewis and ISS of omitting or failing to disclose material information about how it weighs DEI and ESG standards when recommending votes. Bailey's investigation is requesting a range of internal documents and communications to help determine whether Glass Lewis or ISS violated state consumer protection laws through its allegedly misleading claims and lack of transparency. FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS HE IS PUTTING THE STATE’S WOKE COMPANIES ‘ON NOTICE’ Proxy advisory firms are key players in the American financial system, providing recommendations for institutional investors on how to cast their votes on critical shareholder resolutions and proposals. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) "ISS and Glass Lewis have been harming consumers and misleading institutional investors by promoting a radical political agenda instead of focusing on maximizing returns. By taking legal action against both firms, Attorney General Bailey is doing the right thing and holding them accountable for selfishly prioritizing racist DEI quotas, climate activism, and other outdated ESG nonsense," Will Hild, Executive Director at conservative nonprofit Consumers' Research said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "Such deception is not just financially reckless but also illegal and must be met with consequences," Hild continued. "This necessary investigation will aid in exposing these activist proxy advisors for deliberately ditching fiduciary duty in the name of furthering the ESG scam."

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: The EU and the US May Be at Odds, but Is the Animosity Real?

US President Donald Trump secured his second term in office, and a new narrative has emerged. One in which the United States is at odds with the European Union. Alongside newly established 20% tariffs against EU goods, SignalGate painted Europe in unflattering terms during a group chat on the Signal messaging app, where US officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, participated. Vance and Hesgeth depicted EU/NATO allies as “freeloaders” and “pathetic”. At one point, Vance stated that he hates “bailing Europe out again”. This shift in rhetoric has not gone unnoticed abroad. In early March, French President Emmanuel Macron noted in a TV address that the West is entering “a new era”, in which the US may no longer be a trusted ally. That warning adds weight to speculation that Washington’s relationship with Europe may face a structural breakdown. Whether this conflict reflects genuine strategic divergence or a manufactured narrative requires further scrutiny. How much of that purported animosity is real? If it is real, will it lead to a permanent restructuring of world powers? If not, why does it seem so real? To untangle these critical questions, we must first examine the system that produces public belief: governance technology. Since the advent of mass media, governance has undergone permanent changes in its form, and in doing so, altered its nature as well. Walter Lippmann was one of the first to notice, in his 1922 book Public Opinion, that modern democracy relies on mass media. In turn, the mass media helps inform public opinion. However, as mass media consists of nodes that disseminate information to form public opinion, it follows that those who control the nodes control the public consciousness. If that is the case, democracy itself is simply a well-crafted illusion of agency. Key tools of power centralize mass media nodes. Noam Chomsky & Edward S. Herman further detailed this mechanism in their 1988 book Manufacturing Consent. Shoshana Zuboff is one of the latest contributors to this thesis with her 2018 book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, in which she warned that: Two men at Google who do not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercise control over the organization and presentation of the world’s information. One man at Facebook who does not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercises control over an increasingly universal means of social connection, along with the information concealed in its networks. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new agency launched in 2024, revealed just how deeply this control runs. Internal documents from DOGE show that governments worldwide use taxpayer money to fund propaganda and censorship operations without public consent. Even before DOGE, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg regretted his role in colluding with the government to enact mass censorship. It also seems that the division between capitalism and government may be a meaningless exercise, to the chagrin of Zuboff and her concept of “shareholder governance.” Yet, the underlying feature of this phenomenon, this governance technology, is clear. We can divide it into two key components: Specifically, the vast majority of people either lack the time or the cognitive capacity to pick up the implied messaging or delve into secondary information rails. Instead, they absorb only the surface-level messaging, which is visible and promoted by established authority nodes. This topic is also not new in literature, as Antonio Gramsci explored it in his 1929 Prison Notebooks. Gramsci described most people (peasantry, workers) as “subaltern groups”, dominated by the ruling class, whichever type it may be. At the end of the line, in terms of evolutionary biology, it appears that human societies mirror a dominance hierarchy. Perhaps Vilfredo Pareto summed it up best with his theory of the circulation of elites, which Robert Michels later framed as the “iron law of oligarchy” in his seminal 1911 work, Political Parties. Pareto’s theory implies that it is entirely irrelevant what kind of -ism runs society (communism, liberalism, capitalism) because an elite always rules the majority. Naturally, this would make “democracy” both practically and theoretically unfeasible. In this light, it is easy to see why dual-rail messaging and cognitive conversion have become pervasive in modern governance technology. One could even see “democracy” itself as an embedded part of dual-rail communication. One would be remiss not to revisit the most densely packed period in recorded history to point out governance technology in action — the highly anomalous 2020–2022 period. Not to delve too much, here are the basic outlines: This was a fantastic case study of dual-rail messaging and cognitive conversion. In the first half of 2020, it was already discernible that: Later, various countries acknowledged all of this through official statistics. Not only do mask mandates harm people, but vaccinations also do. Professor Stefan Homburg summarized these findings for Germany, which apply to other countries. Of course, the unprecedented coercive measures enacted during the pandemic narrative created the incentives for novel mRNA injections. It turned out in the most extensive vaccine safety study, covering 99 million people, that these injections are exceedingly dangerous, having increased myocarditis risk by 610% among many other conditions. However, as was the case during the entire pandemic narrative, warnings about such a scenario were present long before a single person received the shot. From a governance technology perspective, the pandemic narrative highlighted the following dynamic: To maintain a favorable cognitive conversion rate, global and unprecedented mass censorship had to occur as a matter of structural suppression. Otherwise, all the dissenting doctors, journalists and scientists, as authority nodes in their own right, had the potential to dilute the impact of the first rail messaging. To preserve Rail 1 dominance, it was necessary. Every Rail 1 claim collapsed post-factum, yet zero accountability followed. One could also see the Iraq War in the same light. The Rail 1 promoted the idea of “weapons of mass destruction,” but of course, no one ever found such things. Interestingly, the unprecedented mass censorship and coercion tactics were tonally off, potentially serving as a giant red flag. Yet, this too failed to disrupt the first rail messaging for most people. Again, this is another arrow in Michels’ “iron law of oligarchy” quiver. Now that we understand the key aspect of governance technology, what about the purported deterioration of relations between the EU and the US? The highlighting of nodes during the pandemic narrative is also helpful here. First, let’s review what the “pandemic” actually produced. Perhaps even more importantly, the pandemic narrative highlighted that all major nodes of messaging proliferation are US-centric: Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and others.In concert with the US dollar being the world’s reserve currency, this affords the United States unmatched hegemonic power — cultural, economic, political and technological. Likewise, the Federal Reserve is effectively the world’s central bank. Case in point, just as the Fed launched the historic monetary intervention via BlackRock, so did the European Central Bank (ECB) when it launched the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP). However, another intervention occurred that remains in the public spotlight, generating significant attention and influencing events. Overnight, the pandemic narrative shifted to the Russia–Ukraine conflict in February 2022: the same mediatic intensity, the same censorship, the same deplatforming, the same string of absurdities. The US State Department paved the road for this conflict back in 2014, led by Victoria Nuland, by toppling the pro-Russian Ukrainian government. Nuland supported the Maidan coup through the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a CIA intervention front. At the revolving door point, William J. Burns is currently listed on NED’s official website under the “experts” section, having served as CIA director under the Biden administration. In this company, Nuland was recorded saying “fuck the EU” when discussing the post-toppling regime in Ukraine. Later on, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy ramped up hostilities toward the Russian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which prompted Russia’s direct involvement. Of course, the tie that binds all of these events is NATO’s expansion into Russia’s backyard, as NATO repeatedly broke assurances not to expand. Russia sees this as an existential threat because NATO is a US proxy. The overarching reasoning for all of this is simple. If there is an EU–Russian alliance, economically or politically, this would spell doom for US hegemony. After all, the combination of Russia’s vast land mass and resources with European technology and population density would make the US a second-rate power at best. With this in mind, how does this affect the present EU–US relations? Clumsy clues of deception In the last month, discussions about the EU rearming itself have dominated headlines. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the EU Commission and known for the Pfizergate scandal, announced an expenditure of up to €800 billion ($938,086,304,000) for this effort. The new America First realignment presents this as a consequence. To that end, do you know how the aforementioned leaks happened in which both the US Defence Secretary and Vice President maligned Europe? Well, they invited the Atlantic editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, into their Signal group chat. Again, dual-rail is afoot: Is there evidence for the Rail 2 this time? Just a month before Leyen’s rearming commitment, the US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth noted that the EU/US must establish a “division of labor that maximizes our comparative advantages in Europe and the Pacific, respectively.” The Pacific is a reference to the US shift from Ukraine to China and Taiwan. In other words, the US is using the EU as a counter to Russia’s interests, which leaves it with a larger budget to handle China. There is another deception clue in the mix, quite a big one. In September 2022, targeted bombings rendered the Nord Stream pipeline defunct. This was the key economic instrument that had the potential to bring the EU closer to Russia. Specifically, to bring Germany, the EU’s economic engine, closer to Russia. Ever since, without Russian cheap gas, Germany has been undergoing a rapid process of deindustrialization due to higher energy prices. Simultaneously, more entrepreneurs and industrialists are moving from EU nations to the US. Most tellingly, in its presentation of antagonism between the US and the EU among the European ruling class, there is not a single mention of this international act of terrorism that had such devastating economic consequences. It remains a mystery, as inquiries by the Swedish and Danish authorities yielded no results. Altogether, does this seem clumsy? The core problem is that such adjectives are not meaningful. From the perspective of people with a high cognitive ceiling, the entire pandemic narrative was extremely clumsy. Yet, it was successful nonetheless, still accepted and talked about as real by the majority. Such is the case with the most recent narrative about EU/US relations. The first rail absorbs, while the second delegates to the fringe. With the “iron rule of oligarchy” in mind, which excludes democracy as a coherent concept, it is increasingly apparent why both the EU and the US accrued such massive government deficits. To defend US hegemony, both in the intermediate and distant future. However, the US now holds all the cards. With tariff tools, President Trump can start reshoring American industry. And even without being beholden to the Federal Reserve, Europe faces a massive problem of bureaucratic parasitism, which disincentivizes taxation and undermines net-zero policies. While the US withdrew from the Paris Agreement and ramped up its “drill, baby, drill” approach, Europe is still on a path to net zero. This puts Europe at a severe and crippling disadvantage. One should also remember that Germany systemically denuclearized its power grid, despite this type of power being considered net zero. Without such suicidal policies, even the Nord Stream bombing would have had a muted effect. One wonders if there was external NED-like pressure for Germany’s denuclearization​​ to increase its vulnerabilities. Post-World War II, Europe entered into a vassal relationship with the US. This relationship has only grown stronger, owing to carefully nurtured American dominance in Big Tech, Big Bank and Big Pharma. The present framework doesn’t make the EU stronger but cements US dominance. Both Americans and Europeans have little to no input in what their respective governments do. That’s because the private-public ruling class easily deploys and controls narratives. In turn, a construction that enables people to work against themselves is all too readily available. With the dawn of AI that brings about algorithmic interception, such capacity is likely to increase further. The pandemic narrative and the complete absence of a meaningful response have vindicated Robert Michels, as we can confidently assert. In the new algorithmically powered governance, thoughts will be much easier to intercept. If someone intercepts them, they can modify their behavior accordingly.

AMD stock price surged over 4% after HSBC upgraded it to ‘Buy’ and raised the target price to $200, signaling nearly 40% upside. HSBC is now bullish on AMD’s MI300X and MI350 AI chips, which are gaining ground against NVIDIA’s GPUs. Big names like Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI are adopting AMD accelerators, fueling growth in its AI business. With a $5 billion AI revenue target by 2025 and rising demand across hyperscalers, analysts believe AMD is well-positioned for a major run. Investor confidence is rising, and Wall Street is now betting on AMD to challenge NVIDIA in AI chips.

Title: Retired Garda jailed for attacking and threatening to kill his ex-partner in their home

A MAN HAS been jailed for 20 months for attacking and threatening to kill his then partner in their home at a time when he was a serving garda. Ian Gillen of Carysfort Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin was before Dublin Circuit Criminal Court today, where he pleaded guilty to threatening to kill or cause serious harm to Jennifer Clinton on December 23, 2021, at Trafalgar Lane, Monkstown, and to assaulting Ms Clinton on the same occasion. After hearing facts in the case yesterday, Judge Martin Nolan adjourned the case overnight. Today, Judge Nolan said the custody threshold had been crossed in this case, noting that he had considered the facts of the case, Gillen’s circumstances and mitigation. He imposed a prison sentence of four years, with the final 28 months suspended on strict conditions due to the substantial mitigation and the tragedy in Gillen’s life. Inspector Rachael Kilpatrick testified yesterday that the couple had socialised together that evening in Blackrock Tennis and Bowling Club, where they were members. They had gone home separately, with Ms Clinton arriving home first. Ms Clinton told gardaí that when Gillen arrived home, he called her downstairs to sit on a pouffe by the fireside, where he stood over her in an intimidating manner, rebuking her and calling her names. “Jen, I’m going to rip your head off,” he had said, putting her in fear, and prompting her to make an audio recording of the rest of the incident on her mobile phone, should she not survive. He punched her with a closed fist three times on top of her head. In an effort to get away, she said she needed to go to the toilet, but he refused to let her go. She eventually managed to go, locked the bathroom door behind her, and cleared the windowsill so she’d have a route out. She eventually made her way out of the house. She had managed to record 40 minutes of the threats. An attempt was made to play this in court, but it was not possible due to technical difficulties. A transcript of the recording was handed to the judge instead. Ms Clinton described Gillen’s conduct as pure anger. She said that any time she tried to get up, he kept telling her to sit back down. “You’re going to die tonight,” he told her three times. He also said that he was going to die that night, and she believed her life was in serious danger. After she escaped, Gillen was arrested for coercive control, was interviewed, and the recording was played to him. He was embarrassed and said it wasn’t in him to hit her, but indicated it was another person in his body. “He was shocked by his own behaviour,” said Inspector Kilpatrick. Gillen accepted that he could snap and be angry with drink. He said he had issues in his background, including the death of his son, which caused him to drink. He has since retired and has no previous convictions. Under cross-examination by the defence, the inspector agreed that Gillen had been a front-line garda for 40 years and had dealt with a lot of stressful situations. She accepted that it was in the line of duty that he had to deal with his son taking his own life in his early 20s. Gillen was the first responder on the scene. His mental health deteriorated, and he relied on alcohol. Ms Clinton entered the witness box to deliver an emotional victim impact statement, having to take a break to dry her tears at one stage. She said that her life had been marked by fear and deep trauma since the prolonged assault, when she felt overpowered and trapped. She said she still lived with the consequences every day, having been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression. “I live in a state of hypervigilance,” she said. “I lost my confidence. The memory of that night is etched into my mind and body like the cross he etched into the front door of our shared home one night in a rage”. She said that Gillen’s rising aggression while they socialised in the club that evening was what had prompted her to leave, but that he had then arrived home full of fury. “I wanted my family to know the truth if I did not survive,” she said, referring to the 40 minutes of the assault that she captured on her phone. Advertisement “I’m the biggest white psychopath you’ll ever meet,” he had told her. At one point, Gillen mockingly suggested that she ring Blackrock Garda Station, insinuating that nobody would help her if she did, because he was a serving garda. Ms Clinton said that she had to work out how she would escape from the home, where she had previously felt safe. “I thought of my children and grandchildren and made a break for it. I still have recurring nightmares where I did not get out,” she explained. “Living with him took a deep emotional toll. I felt smaller and smaller all the time,” she said. “The man I once loved became someone I feared.” She said that she was in a state of heartbreak and vulnerability when he attacked her, having lost her sister, her mother, her best friend, as well as Gillen’s son, Cathal. “I’m not the person I was before this happened to me,” she continued. She said that the horror of that night still affected and echoed through the lives of those she loved. “As a longstanding member of An Garda Síochána, he would present himself as a figure, someone to be believed and relied upon to uphold common decency and morality,” she said. She said she had not included the most appalling part of what he had said about being a garda, but that they were in the recording. However, she said that he did not tarnish the reputation of An Garda Síochána, but just of himself. “I’m here for justice,” she said, asking the court to take into account the enduring horror Gillen had caused. Kathleen Leader SC, defending, handed the court two testimonials and a psychologist’s report on behalf of her client, who she said was a deeply ashamed man and apologised for what he had put Ms Clinton through. She said he had faced a number of traumatic incidents in his 40 years with the force. They had taken their toll on him and probably hadn’t been dealt with as they should have been. She described the death of his son in the very recent past, while Gillen was on duty, as every guard’s and parent’s worst nightmare, and asked the court to take it into account. She said that he had retired from the gardaí on medical grounds. Counsel explained that Gillen was a former senior international bowler and a member of Blackrock Bowling Club, while his son had been involved in Cabinteely Soccer Club. He now works to prevent suicide through these clubs. “He has become involved as a person to speak to about mental health issues,” she said. His two referees were in court to support him, she said, with one crediting her client with saving his life and the other saying that he had helped him in the prevention of suicide. “He was enduring a very traumatic event at the time,” she said. “It was an out-of-character incident.” She said that her client attends his GP and a psychiatrist, who told him that he was dealing with his trauma appropriately by helping others. Ms Leader quoted the psychologist’s report as saying Gillen was at a low risk of domestic violence in future, provided things are maintained as they are. “This was a man who was stressed at the time for very good reason, not appropriately dealing with the stress,” she said. Passing sentence today, Judge Martin Nolan said, “It seems only he knows why he attacked her. He beat her over a period of time and slapped her and made very serious threats that were believable”. He said, “This injured party was terrified, and she eventually made her escape”. Judge Nolan said the background to this case is that this defendant is a retired member of An Garda Síochána. He said Gillen was a front-line garda who had to “make difficult decisions, and this can have an effect on a person.” He also noted that Gillen was “visited with a tragic event with the death of his son, which must have affected him”. He said there was a report before the court which outlined how this tragic incident impacted the defendant. The judge said the mitigation in this case is clear: Gillen entered a guilty plea, there was a general level of cooperation, he has no record of conviction, and he has a good work history, all of which the court must acknowledge. Judge Nolan said, “I believe that he has crossed the custody threshold”, noting that this is a very serious matter. He said, “I don’t know what was going through his mind on that night”. Judge Nolan sentenced Gillen to four years in prison, but due to the substantial mitigation and the tragedy in his life, he suspended the final 28 months for 28 months.

Title: How to Survive a Million-Dollar Loss
URL: https://www.practicalecommerce.com/how-to-survive-a-million-dollar-loss
Time Published: 2025-07-11T12:25:15Z
Full Content:
This year I’ve sprinkled occasional “Ecommerce Conversations” episodes with real-life master classes from Beardbrand, my company. To date I’ve addressed hiring, branding, profit-building, priority-setting, and exiting. For this installment, I’ll share Beardbrand’s experience of losing nearly $1 million across 2023 and 2024. I’ll recap how we managed to survive our worst years in business while remaining 100% bootstrapped. It got bad. Our cash levels dropped to where they were in year one, 2014. We were hemorrhaging money. But we’re still here — still building and still learning. We made it through without outside funding. Here’s what the future holds for Beardbrand. My entire audio dialog is embedded below. The transcript is condensed and edited for clarity. A big portion of our loss came from Target. The company had been a seven-figure account for us for years, and we thought the relationship was solid. Every year, we pitched Target our plans. Historically, the staff there provided us with clear feedback — what worked, what didn’t, and where there was room for growth. In 2023, Target had a sustainability initiative. We revamped our packaging, switching from glass and plastic to aluminum. It’s lighter, more recyclable, and aligns with eco-conscious goals. At the same time, we increased the size of our beard oil packaging from 1 oz. bottles to occupy more shelf space and stand out. We committed early, produced inventory, and delivered Target’s purchase orders on time. Then silence. Nothing. After years of working with us, the staff ghosted us. No feedback, no responses. Worse, they dropped us and left us with nearly $200,000 of unpaid product. We erred by giving Target exclusivity, which meant we weren’t selling on Amazon or Walmart. That killed our ability to move leftover inventory quickly when they dropped us. By the time we finally got on Amazon, the products had already aged out. We destroyed a large quantity that had expired. We’ve always run Beardbrand conservatively. That means keeping a decent amount of capital in reserve — not because we’re paranoid, but because you never know when a black swan event might hit. Having that runway lets you make clear, intentional decisions rather than panicking. It gives you time to explore solutions, test channels, and get a better night’s sleep. Thankfully, during our stronger years, we built up a solid cushion. And that cushion is what kept us afloat during the downturn. We essentially burned through all of it. But we never dipped below zero, which meant we didn’t have to take out high-interest loans, open lines of credit, or bring in outside investors. We did have conversations just in case. I even considered withdrawing money from my personal savings. But that’s a hard decision when things aren’t going well. When you’re in the middle of the storm, it doesn’t feel like a temporary dip — it feels like a freefall. You start wondering: Is this the bottom, or is there more pain ahead? Writing another personal check to the business, especially after years of building wealth from it, was not something I wanted to do. And neither did my partners. We were determined to find a way forward that didn’t involve doubling down with personal capital or giving up control. In addition to losing Target, we experienced a series of setbacks. First, the state of Texas audited us. We cooperated fully, waited for the final numbers, and instead got slapped with a tax lien. That lien triggered Brex, our corporate credit card provider, to freeze our account, despite our perfect payment history. Thankfully, American Express stood by us and kept things moving. Then came an ADA lawsuit, a leaked 100% off coupon code, and a $20,000 air conditioner repair at our barbershop. We also faced regulatory changes that forced us to reformulate key fragrances. We had internal missteps, such as losing a key growth team member and coasting when we should’ve pushed harder. We focused on profitability, but the business slowly declined. We simplified our product line to meet a manufacturer’s needs, which, in hindsight, proved to be a mistake. The lesson? Partner with vendors who value your business. You don’t want to be too small to matter, or too big to be managed. That relationship needs to be just right. We also lowered prices to drive volume, but it backfired. Loyal customers just paid less, and those who thought we were expensive still did. Meanwhile, larger packaging reduced purchase frequency, and killing off beloved fragrances hurt loyalty. Top-line revenue got cut in half. Furthermore, when your business shrinks, fixed costs such as office leases and payroll can become overwhelming. Our $10,000 per month lease that once felt small became a big deal. The good news? Beardbrand is alive. We’ve weathered the storm and slowly started turning things around. It hasn’t been a dramatic rebound — it’s been steady, slow progress. We have focused on improving operations, addressing inventory issues, resolving stock-outs, tightening pricing, and enhancing product quality. We now have the right fulfillment provider, manufacturing partners, and systems in place. Instead of existential crises, we’re dealing with everyday stuff — shipping issues, ad performance, and the occasional bad product batch. That’s a massive shift. It’s not glamorous, but it’s no longer a matter of survival. We cut costs aggressively — even eliminating $15 per month software. We reestablished healthy margins. Our customer service, returns, and product quality all depend on having room to breathe financially. The Target fallout is behind us, the tax lien is resolved, and the ADA plaintiff dropped the bogus lawsuit. My business partner stepped out of day-to-day operations, and some team members transitioned to part-time roles, which helped improve our cash flow. We’ve managed all of this without layoffs. My team is the same one that helped us grow, and they’re still incredibly talented and dedicated. I’ve also cut my own salary and lived off personal savings to keep things afloat. But I’m optimistic. With the business stabilizing, we can rebuild our savings and start exploring new growth opportunities again. July 30, 2021 Survival mode means focusing on making it through the day. Some entrepreneurs try to grow their way out of problems. For us, it started with stabilizing operations. We can finally think long-term again. We’ve begun reinvesting in growth, supporting our paid media and Meta efforts, and expanding our creative team to produce more content and ads. More creative output means more chances to connect with customers and fuel a rebound. We’re also rethinking channels beyond direct-to-consumer. Target was a strong retail partner for years. Retail as a channel still holds potential — perhaps it’s independent salons, boutique pharmacies, and grocery stores. The goal is to diversify. Beardbrand.com will always be our home base, but we’re a business that sells to people, not just an ecommerce brand. It’s exciting to think ahead instead of looking back. We’re aiming for 7% profitability this year — that’s breakeven in my book. It provides us with a buffer for unpredictable events, such as lawsuits, audits, and air conditioning failures. The real goal is 17% profit — that’s when we can fund growth, hire employees, and breathe easier. Anything beyond that is the sweet spot where the stress and sacrifice start to feel worth it. I’m excited again — for the team, for the future, and what we’re building. Share this article: Copyright © 2005 - 2025. Practical Ecommerce® is a registered trademark of Confluence Distribution, Inc.

The massive inflows to Bitcoin ETFs were led by BlackRock's IBIT with $448.5 million, followed by Fidelity's FBTC at $324.3 million and ARK's ARKB with $268.7 million, according to Farside Investors data. Even with $40.2 million in outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC, total net flows turned sharply positive. The influx comes as Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $118,000 Friday morning, pushing total net inflows across all U.S. Bitcoin ETFs above $50 billion since their launch last January. Ethereum ETFs locked in $383 million in net inflows on Thursday, their second-highest day on record, dominated by BlackRock’s ETHA with $300.9 million in inflows, per Farside Investors data. The biggest day for spot Bitcoin ETFs was on November 7, with $1.374 billion in inflows following Trump's election victory. "The recent surge in inflows into Bitcoin ETFs signals a significant shift in how large capital allocators are engaging with the digital asset space," Charmaine Tam, head of OTC sales and trading at Hex Trust, told Decrypt. "It reflects a disciplined approach to capital allocation into custody-grade, regulated vehicles." Tam said the institutional embrace gained momentum following the SEC's July 1st guidance on crypto ETF disclosure standards, providing the “regulatory clarity” that risk-averse allocators demanded. "Looking ahead, this momentum could unlock substantial incremental institutional allocation potential, estimated to be in the range of $8-$10 billion in the second half of 2025," she said. Bitcoin is currently trading at $117,899 according to CoinGecko data, having surged to a new all-time high of $118,667 Friday morning. "What stands out is that this buying pressure is occurring even as BTC trades in a tight range near all-time highs, suggesting that the bid is less about chasing momentum and more about strategic allocation,” Chris Colman, Head of Trading, APAC at Gemini, told Decrypt. Colman noted that "spot ETFs now manage close to $150 billion in assets, and because they require the actual purchase of Bitcoin, these inflows represent real demand—not just synthetic exposure." “Macro conditions are supporting the bid," he said, with softer yields and a stable Fed outlook encouraging rotation into "alternatives with asymmetric upside." The supply-demand imbalance triggered massive forced selling, with short sellers getting crushed as Bitcoin surged to new highs. Over $1.14 billion in crypto short positions were liquidated in 24 hours, with Bitcoin shorts bearing the brunt at $679.8 million as the asset demolished resistance levels, per CoinGlass data. The combination of institutional ETF flows, corporate treasury adoption, and retail FOMO has created what Tam describes as "float-adjusted scarcity" premium. Both institutional and retail investors are “bullish on a short term interest rate cut, based on the latest developments around the Fed chair,” Ganesh Mahidhar, investment professional at Further Ventures, told Decrypt. “This is also being supported by more BTC strategies being announced," he added. President Donald Trump ratcheted up pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell Thursday, demanding rate cuts in a Truth Social post: “"Too Late" DEMEANS THE GREAT CREDIT OF THE USA... LOWER THE RATE!!!" Users of on-chain prediction market Myriad are split, with 43.1% predicting the Fed will cut rates in July, while 35.7% of predictors expect no change. The administration also opened a new front against Powell, with Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought accusing the Fed chair of "grossly mismanaging" the central bank and citing a "pricey and ostentatious" $2.5 billion headquarters renovation, roughly $700 million over budget.

US stock market futures fell after President Donald Trump announced a 35% tariff on Canada, starting August 1, intensifying global trade concerns. Despite positive earnings from companies like Delta and Levi Strauss, investor sentiment weakened as Trump warned of more tariffs on key trading partners including the EU, Japan, and Brazil. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures slipped by 0.6% or more early Friday. Meanwhile, all eyes are on next week's CPI data and Q2 earnings from major banks. Oil prices ticked higher on Russia sanction talks, but growth worries persist. This evolving trade agenda has markets on edge.

Title: There’s a rumor that Jeff Bezos will ‘buy’ Conde Nast for Lauren Sanchez
URL: https://www.celebitchy.com/930594/theres_a_rumor_that_jeff_bezos_will_buy_conde_nast_for_lauren_sanchez/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T11:13:08Z
Full Content:
For weeks now, people have theorized about Anna Wintourâs sudden decision to step down as editor-in-chief of American Vogue. Considering her decision came right around Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchezâs wedding – and Laurenâs digital Vogue cover – many people (including me) connected the two. I theorized that Wintour felt forced into putting Lauren on the cover in some way, and she basically had enough and perhaps rage-quit that bitch. But what if it was much more complicated than that? This week, the Daily Mail had an odd exclusive – thereâs a theory being bandied around the media world that Bezos will soon purchase Conde Nast as a âgiftâ for Lauren. Bezos already owns the Washington Post, and perhaps he wants to âgiveâ Vogue to Lauren? Fashion ‘bible’ Vogue could soon be owned by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, sources say. Staff are convinced the world’s fourth-richest man is preparing to buy parent company Conde Nast as a wedding gift for his bride Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist. Many believe it’s no coincidence that the new Mrs Bezos is this month’s digital Vogue cover star and graces its pages wearing a Dolce & Gabbana wedding gown hand-picked by Dame Anna Wintour. Last month Dame Anna announced she was stepping down as Vogue Editor-in-Chief after 37 years in the role but remains in control of global operations. The Newhouse family, who have owned Conde Nast since 1959 and continue to hold it privately under their media empire Advance Publications, insist their titles are not on the market. And last night, a source close to Mr Bezos said it was ‘totally untrue’ that he was considering buying Conde Nast. But with a recent swathe of global redundancies and UK staff now operating from an uninspiring WeWork space near Waterloo station â after Vogue’s Hanover Square HQ was sold â not everyone is convinced. A source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The rumour that Jeff is going to buy Conde Nast is all anyone’s talking about in the fashion industry and inside Vogue. Lauren Sanchez is such an unlikely cover star, and the word is that she landed the July issue partly because the Newhouse family want to butter up Bezos. In New York they’re slimming down the business which is exactly what companies do before a sale.’ The source added: ‘Anna is said to be the one brokering the deal so that’s why Lauren was put on the cover. Anna has equity in the business so has a lot to gain from a sale.’ Mr Bezos is no stranger to publishing. In 2013, he bought The Washington Post for $250 million in cash, ending the Graham family’s four-generation ownership. Another source said: ‘He’s one of the very few people with deep enough pockets. And Lauren is no airhead. She’s a sharp cookie. There have been conversations.’ Insiders say several clues point to something big in the offing. Natalia Gamero Del Castillo, MD of Vogue’s European operations, suddenly ‘disappeared’ from the office last week, prompting her colleagues to suggest she had either quit or fallen victim to the global redundancy drive. The source added: ‘There have been redundancies almost every week in Europe and New York. The UK has had a whole round too. ‘What they’re doing is aligning every publication globally so the structure is uniform across all titles. Anna was the anomaly, she was the only Editor-in-Chief left. GQ has a Global Editorial Director, Glamour has one, Vanity Fair too. So she had to give up the title. I don’t think she was thrilled but she accepted it, probably because she knows the company is getting ready to sell. She still has huge influence but she’s no longer Editor-in-Chief. That title is gone. They’re streamlining everything. Either we’re about to go under or we’re being sold. But something is up and everyone’s talking about Bezos.’ [From The Daily Mail] Unlike most of the Mailâs unhinged reporting, I actually think there could be something here, regardless of the denials from Bezosâ camp. When you think about it, Conde Nast would be something which would interest Bezos, especially as a âgiftâ for Lauren. That being said, the Conde Nast layoffs and streamlining are mostly about the death of print media. Conde Nast is taking a lot of losses and they have been for years. Whichâ¦ makes them ripe for a buyout from a deep-pocketed billionaire. Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos essentially rented out Venice and likely paid celebrities to attend their wedding festivities.

Title: 8BitDo updates its fantastic phone controller with an Xbox-inspired design

Daryl Baxter Published: Jul 11, 2025 Another week means another Xbox partnership, this time with 8BitDo. So far this year, we've seen Microsoft work with manufacturers like Backbone and Meta, as well as with Asus for its upcoming Xbox handheld. We're definitely in a transition of seeing Xbox branch out beyond just its consoles and Game Pass offerings, but now it's 8BitDo's moment. Having released its mobile controller for iPhone and Android devices in October last year, you can now buy an Xbox Edition of the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller, which also comes with some software updates. Available now via Amazon for $49.99, the Xbox Edition of the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller comes in black or white and can fit most Apple iPhones and Android devices. Instead of slotting these phones into a USB-C port, the controller connects to them via Bluetooth, so the controller can also connect to your Apple Mac or Windows PC. The triggers and joysticks have been upgraded to be Hall effect, meaning they'll be more precise and more reliable over long periods. However, as this is Xbox-branded, there's a dedicated Xbox button that brings up its Cloud Gaming service when pressed, instead of 8BitDo's native app. It's another extension of Xbox's 'Play Anywhere' ethos, bringing another option to Xbox fans with the best gaming phones. As an owner of an 8BitDo Pro 2 Controller for several years, which is now paired to my Nintendo Switch 2, I've always found the peripherals to be great. From the designs to the long-lasting battery, I've never had an issue with 8BitDo. It was a natural step for the company to bring out a mobile controller last year for iPhone and Android devices. While I use a Backbone One Halo Edition controller for my iPhone 15 Pro Max, I'd definitely consider 8BitDo's take if it ever gave up the ghost. With Backbone's Halo Edition controller and the Meta Quest 3 Xbox Edition, it's yet another effort from Microsoft to reassure customers that its gaming business is here to stay, despite recent layoffs that have led to the cancellation of games like the Perfect Dark reboot and Everwild, as well as the shutting down of some studios. Still, we'll be more convinced when we finally get our hands on the much-anticipated new Fable game. If you've been an Xbox fan since the early days and want to have something that fits with your smartphone when playing games like Fortnite and PUBG Mobile, the Xbox Edition of 8BitDo's Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller will be a great option. In the meantime, check out our guides to the best gaming tablets and the best mobile controllers if you're thinking of an upgrade for both.

Title: What's Behind The 20% Jump In AES Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) AES Corp.(NYSE:AES) is not usually a stock that makes headlines for significant price fluctuations, but investors were startled this week when it increased almost 20% in just one session on Wednesday. So, what is the reason for this sudden interest? It all comes down to discussions of a potential acquisition. As per reports from Bloomberg and other outlets, AES is reportedly considering strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of the company. Such news typically captures investors' attention—particularly when major players like Blackstone, Brookfield, and BlackRock’s infrastructure division are speculated to be involved. While AES stock has experienced volatility, if you're looking for upside with less risk than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. However, this is not solely about merger and acquisition speculation. AES has a significant role in the clean energy transition, providing renewable energy to major tech firms such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta. With the demand for energy from AI data centers and cloud computing soaring, AES's assets appear much more valuable. Despite recently encountering challenges—like reduced subsidies for renewable initiatives due to changing U.S. policies—the long-term demand narrative remains strong. In essence, merger chatter + AI-driven energy demand = investor enthusiasm. Regardless of whether the buyout rumors materialize or not, AES has just reminded the market that it might deserve a closer examination. Not fond of the unpredictable nature of AES stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What is the reason for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have offered superior returns with less risk when compared to the benchmark index; a smoother experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The Big Bad Republican Bill Wasn’t Regressive Enough for the Anti-Tax Crusaders
URL: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/07/index-capital-gains-inflation-republican-bill-regressive-antitax-grover-norquist/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Mother Jones illustration; Samuel Corum/Getty It is apparently not enough for America’s anti-tax crusaders that Congress just passed one of the most expensive and regressive tax bills in our history. The Washington Post reports that Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform and other conservative groups are now urging the Trump administration to change how investment profits are taxed—unilaterally, if need be—in a way that would overwhelmingly favor the wealthiest Americans. Sound familiar? Namely, they want to index capital gains to inflation. Suppose I bought $100,000 worth of Apple stock on July 10, 2020, and kept it. Today, I could sell that stock for $170,383—a tidy $70,383 profit. That’s a 74 percent overall return and an average annual return of 11.7 percent. Pretty good, right? Not good enough for Norquist et al. These players want to let me adjust the “cost basis”—the price I originally paid for the stock—for inflation. Using this inflation calculator, I could then tell the IRS that my initial $100k investment was in fact a $120,407 investment, and so my profit for tax purposes is only $40,976. This is insane—for several reasons. First, read the room. Congress just passed a megabill whose benefits are deeply skewed in favor of the wealthy. Its tax provisions and spending cuts, taken together, will result in a 4 percent increase in average after-tax income for the richest 1 percent of American households and a nearly 4 percent decrease for the poorest 20 percent, based on the Yale Budget Lab’s analysis. This is very, very unpopular. The bill will add at least $3.3 trillion to the national debt—more like $5 trillion if expiring provisions are extended in the coming years. And indexing capital gains to inflation, according to 2018 estimates from the Tax Policy Center and the Penn Wharton Budget Model, would add yet another $100 billion to $200 billion to the tab—with the richest 1 percent reaping 86 percent of the benefits. “I don’t think reducing [capital gains rates further] will change investor behavior,” says billionaire Mark Cuban. Norquist told the Washington Post he recently spoke with President Donald Trump and recommended the president implement the change with an executive order. Indexing capital gains to inflation was considered during Trump’s first term, the Post‘s Jeff Stein reports, but Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin felt Congress should handle it—current secretary Scott Bessent may prove more compliant. “I said something like, ‘Mr. President, after we do the bill, we will need more economic growth,” Norquist told Stein. “The Big Beautiful Bill is very pro-growth, but with this, we can have even more growth.’” In reality, not one of the Republican tax packages enacted since Ronald Reagan became president has lived up to its sponsors’ economic promises. “The economy may well enjoy a sugar-high the next couple of years, as borrowing stimulates near-term consumption,” Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said in a statement after Congress passed the “One Bie Beautiful Bill” on July 3. “But a sugar-high won’t be sustained, it will do real damage, and often what comes next is the crash.” As for the notion of indexing fueling “more growth,” the billionaire investor Mark Cuban told me in an email that he thinks the current tax rates on capital gains are fair, and “I don’t think reducing it will change investor behavior.” (He added that he would support even lower rates—even zero—under certain circumstances, for ordinary employees of a company that gets liquidated, as a way to reduce wealth inequality.) Yet the fairness of those rates—and their justification—is the subject of fierce debate. Suppose I’m a wealthy investor and I sell assets I’ve held for at least 12 months—stocks, bonds, real estate, or even, say, a stud racehorse—netting my family $1,000,000 in profits. The federal tax on those capital gains ranges from zero for the first $94,000 to 20 percent for the portion that exceeds $583,750. Because my spouse and I have income of more than $250,000, we also have to pay a 3.8 percent “net investment income tax.” This all adds up to an effective tax rate of about 19 percent. But tax rates for wage income are much higher. A couple reporting $1,000,000 in salary income pays an effective rate of about 30 percent. That’s a huge difference, and part of why families whose money comes primarily from asset growth have amassed wealth so much faster than working families have. It no lefty exaggeration to say America’s economic system is rigged against workers and in favor of investors. It’s right there in the tax code. “This kind of proposal will only widen the economic inequality we’re facing.” So how do conservative policy wonks justify the low capital gains rates? A key argument, interestingly, is that inflation eats away at the value of long-term gains. One “solution” would be to index the gains to inflation, notes the libertarian Cato Institute, “but most countries instead roughly compensate” by offering reduced tax rates for investors. And now the anti-taxers want to have it both ways. Investors enjoy other economic advantages, too. Notably, their gains are counted as income only when the assets are sold. In practice, this allows people with a large portfolio of appreciated assets to borrow against their holdings at single-digit interest rates and live off those loans instead of selling assets and paying a double-digit tax. As ProPublica discovered, many of America’s wealthiest families have been doing precisely that. (As a result, from 2014 to 2018, Jeff Bezos paid an effective income tax rate of less than 1 percent.) Or say you have a $100 investment that grows by 10 percent a year during a period of 2 percent annual inflation. The first year’s profit, after inflation, is $8. “But I don’t pay tax on that $8 until I sell, which may be decades later,” says Bob Lord a former tax attorney and associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies. “I’m basically getting a free ride on the appreciation of that $8 portion of my investment.” Doesn’t that benefit, he asks, more than offset any detriment from inflation? And also, isn’t investing supposed to contain an element of risk management? Isn’t the ability to beat inflation part of what separates a savvy investor from a useless one? Indexing for inflation, combined with favorable tax capital gains rates and an exemption for unrealized gains—doesn’t that basically reduce investing to shooting fish in a barrel? It is worth noting, too, that most Americans work for a paycheck, and the ones who make their living via investing are by and large quite wealthy. More than half of Americans now own some stock, but not much. As of January 2024, per Federal Reserve data, 93 percent of US stock holdings were owned by the most affluent 10 percent of the population, and the richest 1 percent owned more than half of all public equities—not to mention private equities. Indexing gains to inflation “would really codify the notion that income taxes are only for people who work for a living,” says Morris Pearl, a former managing director at BlackRock and current chairman of the board of Patriotic Millionaires, a nonprofit that advocates for higher taxes on the rich. If the Trump administration were to attempt the change Norquist recommended—unilaterally or otherwise—its not even clear how it would work. You would presumably need to make changes on both the profit and loss sides of a balance sheet. Kyle Pomerleau, a senior fellow with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, has concluded that indexing is complex and unlikely to generate significant economic impact, and is therefore “more trouble than it’s worth.” “Indexing has been rejected in the past to avoid opening new tax shelters,” says Steven Rosenthal, a Washington tax policy expert and former legislation counsel for the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “If investors were permitted to index their assets, but not required to index their liabilities, debt-financed investments would explode. Investors could exclude profits and deduct interest. But indexing both assets and liabilities is a mess, which I, as a congressional staffer, discovered when we tried to draft it.” “This kind of proposal will only widen the economic inequality we’re facing,” adds Patriotic Millionaires’ Pearl. “It’s absurd that all I would need to do is buy property that I can rent out, and make a lot of money, and never have to pay taxes again!” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

Title: EU ‘has no money except for war’ – Hungarian official
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/621327-hungary-eu-ukraine-fund/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T09:58:50Z
Full Content:
The EU is placing Ukraine’s military needs above the priorities of the bloc’s member states, Hungarian government adviser Balazs Orban has said. He accused EU leaders of always finding money for “war” but not other causes. Leaders of EU nations are considering the creation of a new €100 billion ($117 billion) fund under the bloc’s upcoming seven-year budget to cover expenses for the Ukrainian government, Bloomberg reported this week, citing people familiar with the discussions. Budapest, however, has been a vocal critic of the bloc’s approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict since its onset. “Europe has run out of money – except when it comes to war. There is always 100 billion euros for that,” Orban wrote on Wednesday on social media. He warned that such an allocation of funds would likely lead to further proposals to spend EU taxpayers’ money on Ukraine. Orban pointed to Kiev’s estimate that it would require $1 trillion over 14 years for reconstruction and modernization, a figure shared by Prime Minister Denis Shmigal during a donors conference in Rome this week. “While Europe cannot climb out of its own economic, social and security crisis, Brussels would continue to finance the war – weapons instead of peace, new debt instead of a competitive Europe,” Orban said. Last week, Bloomberg reported that US investment firm BlackRock had abandoned efforts to attract private investors for a Ukraine reconstruction program. The fund was expected to be launched at the Rome conference, but potential participants reportedly expressed “a lack of interest amid increased uncertainty” over the country’s future. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky said at the event that “only friends are invited” to help rebuild the country. He reiterated his call to confiscate Russian state assets frozen by Western nations and transfer them to Kiev. Moscow has warned that such actions would constitute international theft. EU members have voiced concern that expropriating Russian assets could significantly erode global confidence in their financial systems. As an alternative, Ukraine’s backers have been imposing a “windfall tax” on profits from the immobilized Russian funds and channeling the money to Kiev – an approach Moscow has described as another form of criminality. Hungary has accused the EU leadership of inflicting major economic harm on member states through sanctions on Russia, and of wasting resources on a war effort that it argues cannot deliver a military victory over Moscow.

The uptrend remains intact as long as BTC holds above $1,13,500. Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of above $1,16,000, marking a 101 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) gain. With momentum intact, Bitcoin could next target $1,20,000, and possibly more, if ETF inflows and macro conditions stay supportive. The Fear & Greed Index now signals “greed,” reflecting strong investor sentiment and sustained buying interest, observed Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO of Mudrex. He added that institutional participation remains a key driver, with $1.52 billion flowing into crypto funds over the last five trading days. Pankaj Balani, CEO & Co-Founder of Delta Exchange, expressed optimism on the next leg targeting $1,30,000 and beyond, with support from macro conditions and ETF inflows. A sudden surge in Bitcoin’s price triggered a short squeeze, where traders betting against it were forced to buy back in, resulting in over $1 billion in losses and accelerating the rally. The uptrend remains intact as long as BTC holds above $1,13,500. Ethereum’s breakout past $3,000 and its brief lead over Bitcoin in futures volume at $62.1 billion reflects increasing risk appetite and expanding trader interest in ETH derivatives, Balani also said. Many altcoins followed the broader market uptrend, with GRIFFAIN, SAGA, GOAT, and SEIU rallying more than 20 per cent. “If Bitcoin keeps climbing, altcoins could see a surge in optimism and potentially even larger gains.” Institutional demand remains a major driver of this momentum, with US Bitcoin ETFs surpassing $50 billion in net inflows to date. Himanshu Maradiya, Founder & Chairman, CIFDAQ shared that BlackRock alone holds over $65 billion in BTC, while corporate treasuries continue to accumulate. Macroeconomic shifts including a weaker dollar, rising treasury demand, and sovereign credit downgrades are further positioning BTC as a hedge. Ashish Singhal, Co-founder, CoinSwitch, attributed the rise in institutional demand to more favourable signals from the Trump administration in the US. “This rally is not just about price; it reflects how crypto is maturing into a recognised asset class within the global financial system. With smart regulations, policy clarity, and support for homegrown innovation, India can become a global leader in crypto innovation. India can’t afford to be on the sidelines and a time-bound plan to regulate crypto in India is the need of the hour. On the investor side, it’s encouraging to see most portfolios in green,” he said.

With Meta offering up to $100 million as sign-up bonuses to hire artificial intelligence (AI) talent, it has set the new global price of intelligence. Across the US and China, compensation for top talent in AI, quantum computing and other strategic technologies has decoupled entirely from traditional salary frameworks. What was once considered an executive-level package is now being paid to domain specialists, engineers and scientists. In India, we speak confidently of becoming global champions in AI, semiconductors and battery innovation. But are we ready to pay for the talent required to get us there? Also Read: Star chase: Why Mark Zuckerberg is deploying billions to acquire hot AI talent like Alexandr Wang for Meta Corporate India, particularly its promoter-led enterprises, still has a rigid compensation culture. Even the most admired Indian tech companies rarely exceed $1 million in fixed compensation for high-end domain talent, preferring to offer stock or deferred incentives instead. Across the board, executive pay continues to outpace technical pay by a wide margin—even in companies that market themselves as product-first. Imagine a promoter approving even a tenth of Meta’s figure—say, $10 million annually—for a single hire in AI. HR would instinctively reach for the cost-to-company (CTC) template. Legal teams would load the contract with clawbacks and non-competes. And someone around the table would inevitably ask whether this was more than the entire tech team earns. This reflects a discomfort with the idea that a young knowledge-led mind—often without pedigree, polish or deference—could command industrial-level value. It is a problem of culture. Indian businesses have long been comfortable investing $50 million in a new factory or plant. But offering even $5 million to a knowledge architect who can design the core of a future-facing product feels excessive. This inversion, where management is rewarded more than the minds building the product, is one of Indian technology’s least acknowledged handicaps. It’s not because the talent doesn’t exist. India continues to produce some of the best AI researchers, quantum physicists and deep tech engineers in the world. But our systems expect them to settle for prestige, purpose or passion. Also Read: Siddharth Pai: India’s IT firms have a unique opportunity in AI’s trust deficit There’s a persistent myth that because India’s tech talent is “mission-driven" and that it will accept under-compensation in return for vision or national pride. That might work if you’re a global frontrunner offering unmatched exposure. But when that same talent has offers from research labs in Silicon Valley, Zurich or Singapore—with salaries 8 to 100 times higher—purpose alone won’t bridge the gap. Vision must be paired with valuation: Across the world, many governments and corporations understand this. The UAE has appointed a minister for AI. Singapore offers co-funded AI fellowships with public-private partnerships. Germany’s AI strategy includes billions in subsidies tied to industrial research teams. These are economic bets on the future of productivity. India’s response so far has been largely declarative: strategies, mission and some funding. But talent doesn’t read these documents. It reads offers, options and opportunities. Also Read: Manu Joseph: Why nobody talks about India’s ‘brain drain’ anymore There is precedent for bold compensation in India’s business history. Two decades ago, during the retail boom, one of India’s largest conglomerates hired 15-plus marquee CEOs at salaries reportedly several times higher than their previous pay. It was a bold bet—one that catalyzed knowledge transfer, global systems and new processes. But once the infrastructure was built, the appetite for such talent faded. The notion that talent is fungible took root again. In deep tech sectors, that assumption won’t hold. In the technology era, talent must be treated as strategic capital expenditure. Hiring a world-class AI researcher is like the first kilometre of pipeline in a new industrial system. Yet, most Indian promoters would find it ego-challenging to write that check unless the individual’s value could be directly tied to revenues already realized, or probably the talent is in their bloodline. That mindset is precisely what could cost us the future. Also Read: Beware India Inc., headhunters are poaching your talent for themselves It’s no longer sufficient to celebrate Indian-origin AI leaders at DeepMind, Google or OpenAI. If we underpay the very talent we claim to revere, we aren’t reversing brain drain—we’re subsidizing innovation elsewhere. And the problem runs deeper than compensation structures. Indian business culture still places enormous symbolic value on control, lineage and loyalty. It’s far more comfortable rewarding long-term insiders than investing aggressively in external experts. But deep tech respects none of these traditional codes. It rewards only edge. The question is not whether India has the financial bandwidth but whether it has the emotional maturity to accept that true capability may reside in those who don’t conform to existing hierarchies. Even India’s startup ecosystem hasn’t escaped this gravity. Founders flush with venture capital hesitate to offer globally competitive salaries to specialist talent. Many prefer to overhire generalists rather than back one game-changing domain expert. Performance-linked employee stock options are useful but they’re no substitute for upfront recognition of value. The test of the new economy is not regulation, nor market access. It isn’t equity capital either—these are traditional entry barriers that large Indian firms are comfortable overcoming. The real question is whether they can recognize that in a world of knowledge-driven industries, intellect is infrastructure. The question then is no longer whether we can afford to pay top talent. It is whether we can afford not to. The author is a corporate advisor and author of ‘Family and Dhanda’ Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Title: Valuation Check: Is Nvidia still a buy after the surge?

Nvidia’s stock closed at $164.10 on Thursday, gaining 0.75% during the day. This pushed the chipmaker’s total market value to $4.004 trillion, marking the first time it ended a trading session above this milestone. With this, Nvidia has extended its lead over tech giants Apple and Microsoft, reinforcing its dominance in the AI-driven tech rally. (Source: Reuters) Nvidia’s high-performance processors are central to the AI infrastructure being built by major tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. These firms are investing heavily in artificial intelligence data centres, and Nvidia's chips are powering much of that transformation, making the company a key enabler in the ongoing AI revolution. After reaching a $1 trillion market capitalisation in June 2023, Nvidia has tripled its value in just about a year—a feat unmatched by even the largest tech firms. Microsoft is currently valued at $3.73 trillion, while Apple, impacted by slower AI integration, has slipped to $3.17 trillion after a 15% decline in its stock price this year. Despite its impressive growth, Nvidia faces some challenges. Rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China could affect its ability to export its most powerful chips. Analysts also caution that as AI adoption becomes more widespread, demand might shift to more affordable alternatives, posing a competitive threat to Nvidia’s high-margin products. Even with its meteoric rise, Nvidia’s stock is currently trading at around 33 times expected earnings. This is actually lower than its five-year average price-to-earnings ratio of 41, according to LSEG. While lofty, the valuation is not considered excessively stretched relative to its historical norm, indicating investor confidence in sustained future growth.

Critics warn of labor shortages in construction and agriculture as foreign-born workers exit workforce. Critics warn of labor shortages in construction and agriculture as foreign-born workers exit workforce. The U.S. Department of Laborâs June Employment Situation Report revealed a seismic shift in the labor market under President Donald Trumpâs administration: Native-born workers have earned 2.056 million jobs since January 2025, while foreign-born employment fell by 543,000. The Household Survey data, highlighting a stark demographic divergence, has become a focal point of the Trump White Houseâs narrative of prioritizing American workers amid tightening immigration policies. In June alone, native-born Americans added 830,000 jobs, pushing their total labor-force participation to a record high of 132.65 million. By contrast, foreign-born workersâwhich include both legal and unauthorized immigrantsâreported a 348,000 drop in June and a 543,000-year-to-date decline. The turnaround contrasts sharply with 2024, when foreign-born employment rose 1.025 million under the Biden administration, nearly matching native-born gains of 1.099 million. âThis economy is booming again,â declared White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on July 9. âAmerican-born workers have accounted for ALL of the job gains since President Trump took office, and wage growth continues climbing. These numbers prove our policies are working.â The report solidified a trend Trumpâs team has emphasized since reclaiming the White House: dismantling policies perceived as disadvantaging U.S. workers. White House communications have repeatedly framed the data as proof of fulfilling promises to prioritize native-born labor force participation, long a cornerstone of Trumpâs political identity. Policy-driven transformation: Immigration crackdown sparks economic shift The administration attributes the reversal to aggressive implementation of its âAmerica Firstâ agenda. The Trump era has seen dramatically increased workplace immigration enforcement, including raids targeting employers of unauthorized workers and stricter eligibility checks. White House officials argue this has incentivized businesses to hire native-born Americans, who now dominate job growth. The report coincided with record-monthly deportations: 188,000 unauthorized immigrants removed in June, a 55% increase over Januaryâs totals. Employers across industries face heightened penalties for non-compliance, with companies like Amazon and Tyson Foods recently restricting hiring of non-citizen applicants. However, critics contend the crackdown exacerbates labor shortages in sectors reliant on foreign-born workers, including agriculture and construction. A Bloomberg analysis warns 5% of the workforceâover 5 million workersâcould exit labor markets in key industries, putting pressure on food production and infrastructure projects. âThe administrationâs singular focus on restricting immigration is creating new risks to economic stability, particularly in sectors that canât function without immigrant labor,â said labor economist Dr. Maria Espinosa. âThis isnât just a demographic shiftâitâs a redefinition of who participates in the U.S. economy.â Balancing gains and challenges: Sector shifts and economic uncertainties While White House rhetoric centers on the 2.056 million native-born job gains, the report also highlights uneven sector growth and lingering weaknesses. Total nonfarm payrolls rose 147,000 in June, led by the nearly 200,000-worker surge in healthcare and educational servicesâa trend attributed to federal spending mandates for clinics and public schools. Yet the expansion was uneven. Private sectors outside healthcare faltered, with manufacturing and technology firms announcing 18,000 layoffs in June. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dipped to 3.9%, near historic lows, but broader Labor Department metrics show rising hardship for foreign-born workers: about 820,000 filed for unemployment claims since January, many citing workplace crackdowns as cause. Soutbay Research analysts warned of fragility: âJuneâs strong headline numbers depend largely on volatile sectors,â including government jobs and public education. âA harsh winter season or federal funding lull could unravel progress.â Public sector dominance has also drawn scrutiny, with critics questioning the sustainability of government-linked employment in a 13th consecutive month of economic expansion. The road ahead: Legislative hopes and theÂ âOne Big Beautiful Bill Actâ early test The Biden-era Paycheck Protection Programâs expiration and a contentious debate over the âOne Big Beautiful Bill Actâ loom large over Trumpâs economic agenda. The proposed law would formalize policies to restrict foreign labor and expand vocational training for Americans, a pillar of the administrationâs jobs strategy. âOnce Congress passes the One Big Beautiful Bill, these numbers will explode,â Leavitt declared, predicting a 30% acceleration in job creation by 2026. The act faces fierce opposition, notably from Republican moderates wary of labor shortages stifling economic growth. As the 2026 elections approach, the reportâs triumphs and tensions reflect deeper ideological divisions. For the Trump team, the 200,000-plus monthly native-born gains since January 2025 vindicate the central campaign pledges of an economy âbuilt for Americans first.â Yet as sectors like agriculture reel, the debate over whether that approach serves all Americans continues apace. A prosperous future Juneâs jobs data highlights a historic shift toward prioritizing American workers, directly reflecting policies championed by the Trump administration to reclaim control over our workforce. These measures, which prioritize domestic labor over outsourcing and restrictive trade deals, signal a vital step toward reversing decades of wage stagnation and job displacement caused by flawed immigration practices and globalist agreements. As Congress advances the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the labor marketâs evolution underscores the imperative to prioritize U.S. sovereignty and fairness for working families. By curbing reliance on foreign worker visas, securing borders and renegotiating trade terms that favor American industries, policymakers have laid the groundwork for a economy that rewards hardworking Americansâensuring long-term prosperity rests on a foundation of domestic strength, equitable wages and a clear focus on who matters most: the people of this nation.

A prosperous future Juneâs jobs data highlights a historic shift toward prioritizing American workers, directly reflecting policies championed by the Trump administration to reclaim control over our workforce. These measures, which prioritize domestic labor over outsourcing and restrictive trade deals, signal a vital step toward reversing decades of wage stagnation and job displacement caused by flawed immigration practices and globalist agreements.

Policy-driven transformation: Immigration crackdown sparks economic shift The administration attributes the reversal to aggressive implementation of its âAmerica Firstâ agenda. The Trump era has seen dramatically increased workplace immigration enforcement, including raids targeting employers of unauthorized workers and stricter eligibility checks.

Employers across industries face heightened penalties for non-compliance, with companies like Amazon and Tyson Foods recently restricting hiring of non-citizen applicants. However, critics contend the crackdown exacerbates labor shortages in sectors reliant on foreign-born workers, including agriculture and construction. A Bloomberg analysis warns 5% of the workforceâover 5 million workersâcould exit labor markets in key industries, putting pressure on food production and infrastructure projects. âThe administrationâs singular focus on restricting immigration is creating new risks to economic stability, particularly in sectors that canât function without immigrant labor,â said labor economist Dr. Maria Espinosa. âThis isnât just a demographic shiftâitâs a redefinition of who participates in the U.S. economy.â Balancing gains and challenges: Sector shifts and economic uncertainties While White House rhetoric centers on the 2.056 million native-born job gains, the report also highlights uneven sector growth and lingering weaknesses.

A Bloomberg analysis warns 5% of the workforceâover 5 million workersâcould exit labor markets in key industries, putting pressure on food production and infrastructure projects. âThe administrationâs singular focus on restricting immigration is creating new risks to economic stability, particularly in sectors that canât function without immigrant labor,â said labor economist Dr. Maria Espinosa. âThis isnât just a demographic shiftâitâs a redefinition of who participates in the U.S. economy.â Balancing gains and challenges: Sector shifts and economic uncertainties While White House rhetoric centers on the 2.056 million native-born job gains, the report also highlights uneven sector growth and lingering weaknesses. Total nonfarm payrolls rose 147,000 in June, led by the nearly 200,000-worker surge in healthcare and educational servicesâa trend attributed to federal spending mandates for clinics and public schools. Yet the expansion was uneven. Private sectors outside healthcare faltered, with manufacturing and technology firms announcing 18,000 layoffs in June. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dipped to 3.9%, near historic lows, but broader Labor Department metrics show rising hardship for foreign-born workers: about 820,000 filed for unemployment claims since January, many citing workplace crackdowns as cause. Soutbay Research analysts warned of fragility: âJuneâs strong headline numbers depend largely on volatile sectors,â including government jobs and public education. âA harsh winter season or federal funding lull could unravel progress.â Public sector dominance has also drawn scrutiny, with critics questioning the sustainability of government-linked employment in a 13th consecutive month of economic expansion. The road ahead: Legislative hopes and theÂ âOne Big Beautiful Bill Actâ early test The Biden-era Paycheck Protection Programâs expiration and a contentious debate over the âOne Big Beautiful Bill Actâ loom large over Trumpâs economic agenda. The proposed law would formalize policies to restrict foreign labor and expand vocational training for Americans, a pillar of the administrationâs jobs strategy. âOnce Congress passes the One Big Beautiful Bill, these numbers will explode,â Leavitt declared, predicting a 30% acceleration in job creation by 2026. The act faces fierce opposition, notably from Republican moderates wary of labor shortages stifling economic growth. As the 2026 elections approach, the reportâs triumphs and tensions reflect deeper ideological divisions. For the Trump team, the 200,000-plus monthly native-born gains since January 2025 vindicate the central campaign pledges of an economy âbuilt for Americans first.â Yet as sectors like agriculture reel, the debate over whether that approach serves all Americans continues apace. A prosperous future Juneâs jobs data highlights a historic shift toward prioritizing American workers, directly reflecting policies championed by the Trump administration to reclaim control over our workforce. These measures, which prioritize domestic labor over outsourcing and restrictive trade deals, signal a vital step toward reversing decades of wage stagnation and job displacement caused by flawed immigration practices and globalist agreements. As Congress advances the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the labor marketâs evolution underscores the imperative to prioritize U.S. sovereignty and fairness for working families. By curbing reliance on foreign worker visas, securing borders and renegotiating trade terms that favor American industries, policymakers have laid the groundwork for a economy that rewards hardworking Americansâensuring long-term prosperity rests on a foundation of domestic strength, equitable wages and a clear focus on who matters most: the people of this nation.

Title: Melting glaciers awaken hundreds of dormant volcanoes, threatening global chaos

Key points: Glacier melt is destabilizing volcanoes, triggering more frequent and explosive eruptions. Historical data reveals that rapid ice loss following the last ice age unleashed violent volcanic activity â a pattern repeating today. High-risk zones include North America, New Zealand, Russia, and Antarctica, where pressure shifts threaten dormant magma reservoirs. Underground nuclear tests and deep drilling may artificially hasten volcanic awakenings, with catastrophic environmental consequences. Governments and corporations remain dangerously unprepared for the cascading effects of multiple eruptions, including climate disruption and mass displacement. Ice retreat, volcanic awakening: A ticking time bomb A groundbreaking study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison has revealed a chilling connection: As glaciers vanish, the suppression they once exerted on magma chambers beneath them weakens, allowing pent-up gases and molten rock to expand explosively. By analyzing crystal formations in Chilean volcanoes, researchers confirmed that rapid glacial retreat 18,000 years ago led to volcanic eruptions of unprecedented scale â a phenomenon poised to repeat itself. "Glaciers act like a lid on a pressure cooker," explained geologist Pablo Moreno-Yaeger. "When that lid melts away, the buildup beneath can detonate violently." His teamâs findings suggest that regions once blanketed by thick ice â such as North Americaâs Cascade Range, Russiaâs Kamchatka Peninsula, and New Zealandâs Taup? Volcanic Zone â are now primed for disaster. Even more alarming? The Antarctic ice sheets, which conceal dozens of hidden volcanoes, are melting at accelerating rates, raising fears of a continent-wide eruption cycle never witnessed by modern civilization. Human meddling: Hastening nature's wrath Human interference deep within the Earthâs crust may be exacerbating the danger. Since the mid-20th century, underground nuclear tests have unleashed shockwaves powerful enough to fracture tectonic fault lines â potentially destabilizing nearby volcanic systems. Meanwhile, large-scale drilling projects â whether for oil, geothermal energy, or carbon sequestration â puncture fragile geological layers, creating pathways for magma to surge toward the surface. Evidence of this tampering already exists. In 1961, the Soviet Unionâs Tsar Bomba â the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated â triggered seismic waves equivalent to a magnitude-5.0 earthquake. More recently, the controversial HAARP program in Alaska, designed to manipulate the ionosphere, has been accused of inducing seismic disturbances near volcanic zones. "When we bombard the Earth with these unnatural forces, we gamble with forces we barely understand," warns seismologist Dr. Ken McGee. "A single misplaced detonation or drill hole could be the spark that lights the fuse." Human activities â such as fluid injection, extraction, reservoir impoundment, and mining â can induce earthquakes, a phenomenon known as induced seismicity. Fluid injection: Pumping fluids (e.g., fracking wastewater, geothermal injection) deep underground increases pore pressure in rock formations, lubricating faults and prompting slippage that results in earthquakes. Fluid extraction: Removing large volumes of oil, gas, or groundwater alters crustal stress patterns, destabilizing fault zones and potentially triggering seismic events. Reservoir impoundment: The immense weight of water in dammed reservoirs shifts stress on underlying faults, occasionally causing earthquakes. Mining: Excavation disrupts the stress equilibrium of rock masses, leading to small tremors or earthquakes. Global unpreparedness The grim reality is this: Global disaster response systems are woefully unequipped for a wave of super-eruptions. The 2010 eruption of Icelandâs EyjafjallajÃ¶kullâa relatively minor eventâgrounded air traffic across Europe for weeks, costing billions in economic losses. A Yellowstone-scale event, by comparison, could blanket the U.S. Midwest in ash, collapse supply chains, and trigger mass famine. Yet instead of investing in decentralized survival strategies â such as natural medicine stockpiles, community-based food reserves, and independent energy grids â governments funnel trillions into militarization and corporate bailouts. Private contractors like BlackRock and Halliburton already position themselves to monopolize on reconstruction efforts. Meanwhile, the same elites pushing climate lockdowns and digital IDs quietly purchase underground bunkersâluxury shelters where they plan to ride out the chaos they helped unleash. The awakening of Earthâs slumbering giants is no longer a question of if but when. Survival demands an immediate rejection of the corrupt institutions that downplay these threats â and a return to self-reliance, truth-telling, and natural resilience.

Reservoir impoundment: The immense weight of water in dammed reservoirs shifts stress on underlying faults, occasionally causing earthquakes. Mining: Excavation disrupts the stress equilibrium of rock masses, leading to small tremors or earthquakes. Global unpreparedness The grim reality is this: Global disaster response systems are woefully unequipped for a wave of super-eruptions. The 2010 eruption of Icelandâs EyjafjallajÃ¶kullâa relatively minor eventâgrounded air traffic across Europe for weeks, costing billions in economic losses. A Yellowstone-scale event, by comparison, could blanket the U.S. Midwest in ash, collapse supply chains, and trigger mass famine. Yet instead of investing in decentralized survival strategies â such as natural medicine stockpiles, community-based food reserves, and independent energy grids â governments funnel trillions into militarization and corporate bailouts. Private contractors like BlackRock and Halliburton already position themselves to monopolize on reconstruction efforts. Meanwhile, the same elites pushing climate lockdowns and digital IDs quietly purchase underground bunkersâluxury shelters where they plan to ride out the chaos they helped unleash. The awakening of Earthâs slumbering giants is no longer a question of if but when. Survival demands an immediate rejection of the corrupt institutions that downplay these threats â and a return to self-reliance, truth-telling, and natural resilience. Sources include: Dailymail.co.uk ScienceDaily.com TheIndependent.com A groundbreaking study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison has revealed a chilling connection: As glaciers vanish, the suppression they once exerted on magma chambers beneath them weakens, allowing pent-up gases and molten rock to expand explosively. By analyzing crystal formations in Chilean volcanoes, researchers confirmed that rapid glacial retreat 18,000 years ago led to volcanic eruptions of unprecedented scale â a phenomenon poised to repeat itself. "Glaciers act like a lid on a pressure cooker," explained geologist Pablo Moreno-Yaeger. "When that lid melts away, the buildup beneath can detonate violently." His teamâs findings suggest that regions once blanketed by thick ice â such as North Americaâs Cascade Range, Russiaâs Kamchatka Peninsula, and New Zealandâs Taup? Volcanic Zone â are now primed for disaster. Even more alarming? The Antarctic ice sheets, which conceal dozens of hidden volcanoes, are melting at accelerating rates, raising fears of a continent-wide eruption cycle never witnessed by modern civilization. Human meddling: Hastening nature's wrath Human interference deep within the Earthâs crust may be exacerbating the danger. Since the mid-20th century, underground nuclear tests have unleashed shockwaves powerful enough to fracture tectonic fault lines â potentially destabilizing nearby volcanic systems. Meanwhile, large-scale drilling projects â whether for oil, geothermal energy, or carbon sequestration â puncture fragile geological layers, creating pathways for magma to surge toward the surface. Evidence of this tampering already exists. In 1961, the Soviet Unionâs Tsar Bomba â the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated â triggered seismic waves equivalent to a magnitude-5.0 earthquake. More recently, the controversial HAARP program in Alaska, designed to manipulate the ionosphere, has been accused of inducing seismic disturbances near volcanic zones. "When we bombard the Earth with these unnatural forces, we gamble with forces we barely understand," warns seismologist Dr. Ken McGee. "A single misplaced detonation or drill hole could be the spark that lights the fuse." Human activities â such as fluid injection, extraction, reservoir impoundment, and mining â can induce earthquakes, a phenomenon known as induced seismicity.

Title: Pentagon to become largest shareholder in Rinehart-backed rare earth miner MP Materials

The Defense Department will become the largest shareholder in Gina Rinehart-backed rare earths miner MP Materials after agreeing to buy $US400 million ($606m) of its preferred stock. MP Materials owns the only operational rare earth mine in the US at Mountain Pass, California, about 60 miles outside Las Vegas. Proceeds from the Pentagon investment will be used to expand MP’s rare earths processing capacity and magnet production, the company said. Shares of New York-listed MP Materials soared about 50 per cent to close at $US45.23 ($68.59). Its market capitalisation grew to $US7.4 billion ($11.2b), an increase of about $US2.5b ($3.8b) from the previous trading session. Mrs Rinehart, Australia’s richest person, saw her 8.5 per cent holding in MP via Hancock Prospecting add approximately $US211m ($320m) to her net worth overnight. Rare earths are used in magnets that are key components in a range of military weapons systems including the F-35 warplane, drones and submarines, according to the Defense Department. The US was almost entirely dependent on foreign countries for rare earths in 2023, with China representing about 70 per cent of imports, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Rare earths have been a central point of contention in recent trade disputes between the US and China. Ryan Browne Kevin Breuninger Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in April that the Trump administration was considering making direct equity investments in critical mineral companies to break US dependence on China. MP Materials CEO James Litinsky described the Pentagon investment as a public-private partnership that will speed the buildout of an end-to-end rare earth magnet supply chain in the US. “I want to be very clear, this is not a nationalisation,” Litinsky told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Thursday. “We remain a thriving public company. We now have a great new partner in our economically largest shareholder, DoD, but we still control our company. We control our destiny. We’re shareholder driven.” US miners are facing a unique threat from “Chinese mercantilism,” he said. The Pentagon investment in MP could serve as a model for similar deals with other US companies, the CEO said. “It’s a new way forward to accelerate free markets, to get the supply chain on shore that we want and make sure that mercantilism is not going to hurt our ability to do so,” Mr Litinsky said. The Pentagon is buying a newly created class of preferred shares convertible into MP Materials’ common stock, in addition to a warrant convertible at $US30.03 ($45.55) a share for 10 years that allows the US to buy additional common stock. Exercising the convertible preferred shares and the warrant would leave the Pentagon holding about a 15 per cent stake in MP Materials as of July 9, nearly twice the 8.61 per cent held by Litinsky and the 8.27 per cent held by BlackRock Fund Advisors, according to FactSet data. MP Materials will build its second magnet manufacturing facility in the US to serve defence and commercial customers with support from the Pentagon. The facility, whose location wasn’t disclosed, is expected to start commissioning in 2028 and will bring MP Materials rare earth magnet manufacturing capacity to 10,000 metric tonnes annually. This manufacturing capacity is enough to “meaningfully support US defense and commercial needs,” Mr Litinsky told investors on a call Thursday morning. Arjun Kharpal The Pentagon has agreed to buy 100 per cent of the magnets made at the new facility, called 10X, for 10 years after the plant is built to support defense needs and the commercial market. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are providing $1b ($1.5b) to help finance the manufacturing facility. The Pentagon is also guaranteeing a minimum price of $US110 ($166.86) per kilogram for 10 years for neodymium-praseodymium oxide, or NdPr, that is stockpiled or sold by MP Materials. NdPr is a rare earth compound used to make permanent magnets. If the market price is below $US110 per kilogram, the US will pay MP Materials the difference in a quarterly cash payment, Mr Litinsky said. The Pentagon, in turn, will receive 30 per cent of the upside above $110 per kilogram once MP Materials’ second magnet facility is operational, the CEO said. The Defense Department negotiated a very tough deal, Litinsky said. “The taxpayers are going to make a lot of money,” the CEO said. MP Materials also expects to receive a $US150m ($227m) loan in 30 days from the Pentagon to expand its rare earth separation capabilities at Mountain Pass.

Title: BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale Dominate Crypto ETF Assets Amidst Institutional Interest

The firms’ offerings made up 85% of all crypto AUM, while separate research found 75% of investors expect cryptocurrency to soon become part of institutional allocations. Institutional investors expect cryptocurrency to become more prevalent in institutional portfolios and expect traditional financial institutions to dramatically increase their launches of digital asset funds in the near future. According to London-based Nickel Digital Asset Management Ltd., which partnered with research firm Pureprofile to interview 200 institutional investors and wealth managers for the project, 75% of respondents said they expect cryptocurrencies to become a part of institutional portfolio asset allocation within the next five years. Cryptocurrency ETFs are often used by institutional asset owners that seek exposure to the digital asset class. These offerings are dominated by three firms, according to research from ISS Market Intelligence, which, like CIO, is owned by ISS STOXX. BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Grayscale Investments manage more than 85% of all crypto ETF assets under management, totaling approximately $123 billion, ISS MI reported. Fidelity offers exposure to bitcoin and ether through its Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund and its Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and Grayscale offers exposure through four different funds. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert newsletter.  BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and iShares Ethereum Trust account for $70 billion in assets, about half of crypto ETF AUM. The Nickel Digital survey also found that 66% of respondents said they see cryptocurrency as the asset class with the biggest opportunity to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns over the next five years, followed by private equity and emerging market equities at 64% and 61%, respectively. These investors expect more “traditional financial institutions” to launch crypto funds over the next two years, with 43% saying there will be a dramatic increase and 53% anticipating a slight increase. “Traditional finance firms are already making significant strides into the digital assets space and that is only predicted to increase over the next two years,” said Anatoly Crachilov, CEO and founding partner in Nickel Digital, in a statement. “The views of institutional investors and wealth managers on the ability of crypto to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns helps to explain why that is the case, and why professional investors increasingly expect crypto to be part of institutional investors portfolio allocation.” The Trump administration includes a slate of regulators who are proponents of digital assets, including Jonathan Gould, an attorney who was confirmed by the Senate Thursday to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. After serving the first Trump administration, he was chief legal officer at Bitfury Group, a provider of crypto mining equipment and related services. Additional belief that interest in digital assets also follows the Senate’s passage of the landmark GENIUS Act, setting the stage for the enactment of the first federal framework for stablecoins. The House is scheduled to vote on the measure next week.

Jensen Huang’s wealth could soon overtake famed investor Warren Buffett’s, after Nvidia's rising stock earlier this week made the AI chipmaker the most valuable company in history. Nvidia (NVDA) on Wednesday became the first company to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion when its stock briefly climbed above $163.93. The shares added another 0.8% Thursday to close just above $164, a record, leaving them 21% higher for 2025 and up roughly 1,400% over the past 5 years. Huang, Nvidia's CEO, owns about 3.5% of the AI boom's poster child. He's seen his net worth climb to an estimated $142 billion as of Wednesday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, rising $2.47 billion yesterday alone, and swelling over $27 billion since the start of the year. This week’s gains have made Huang the 10th richest person in the world in Bloomberg’s ranking, just behind Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) CEO and "Oracle of Omaha" Warren Buffett at an estimated $144 billion. At that level, it wouldn't take much for Huang's wealth to overtake Buffett's. Wall Street's analysts are largely bullish on Nvidia's potential for more gains, with a mean target near $175 compiled by Visible Alpha. A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the stock's gains and Huang's net worth.

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts Three Big Things This Week: Jason’s Directness: “It will be the biggest issue of 2026, I think, in B2B AI is just the inability to recruit talent… If you think your answer is to go hire a VP of AI that wears a tie and is studying things like just shut the startup down.” The AI talent war will separate winners from losers more brutally than any previous technology cycle. Rory’s Reality: “The truth is there’s a small number of things that are working really well, and everything else looks dull in comparison… So if you start to pull ahead, provided you continue to execute, it’s very hard to catch up.” Market dynamics now favor extreme concentration of success, making early leads nearly insurmountable. Harry’s Honesty: “If you don’t want to embrace [AI], you are going to make this ship sink… If you need a week for rediscovery week, I promise you, you’re not going to work.” The AI adoption window has closed – adapt immediately or become irrelevant. The venture capital and SaaS landscape is experiencing seismic shifts that will fundamentally reshape how companies compete, hire, and operate. In the latest episode of the 20VC podcast, three industry leaders dissected the most critical developments defining 2025’s market dynamics. The business world was stunned when Daniel Gross and Nat Friedman, two of Silicon Valley’s most respected figures, abandoned their $1.1 billion venture fund NFDG to join Meta. The mathematics behind this decision reveal the extraordinary economics reshaping the industry. According to the podcast analysis, NFDG had deployed roughly $500 million of their fund and achieved a 4x return in just two years – generating approximately $1.5 billion in gains and $300 million in carried interest for the partners. Despite this stellar performance, Meta’s offer was compelling enough to walk away from an additional $1.5 billion in investable capital. NFDG: The $1.1B VC Fund That 4X’d in Two Years—Then Got Acquired by Meta The Strategic Implications This wasn’t just an acqui-hire; it represents Meta’s systematic approach to building an “AI talent magnet.” As Jason Lemkin noted, “The best want to work for the best… and the tough thing is they want to work for the prominent best in many cases.” Meta’s strategy mirrors what worked at X (formerly Twitter) under Elon Musk – creating a “mega mecca for talent” that attracts top performers who refuse to settle for anything less than excellence. This approach is becoming essential because, as the speakers emphasized, struggling companies can’t attract great talent regardless of their growth metrics. Perhaps the most sobering discussion centered on the emerging talent crisis in B2B AI. The numbers are staggering: companies are now offering $800,000+ annual packages plus RSUs and guarantees to secure top AI engineering talent. One founder shared that he’s giving away 0.5-1% equity stakes to each AI engineer – unsustainable math at scale. The success of companies like Cursor is creating ripple effects throughout the industry. As one multi-billion dollar company founder told Lemkin, “My single biggest challenge today is cursor… they’re just paying insane amounts of money for everyone.” This creates an existential question for SaaS companies: How do you compete when you can’t afford the talent war? The speakers identified several harsh realities: One of the most fascinating discussions revealed how dramatically investor expectations have shifted. The traditional SaaS growth trajectory of “triple, triple, double, double” (tripling revenue for two years, then doubling for two years) is no longer exciting in today’s market. Why Traditional SaaS Metrics Are Losing Their Luster Rory O’Driscoll explained the new mathematics: “If there’s two games and one of them has that embedded 10% chance of amazing, like 20 billion, a cursor outcome, and one of them just doesn’t… there’s no price at which you’ll do it.” This creates a painful reality for solid, profitable SaaS companies growing at 20-25% annually. They’re caught in a valley between: The Toma Bravo acquisition of Olo (a profitable, $320M ARR company) for $2 billion at 6.5x revenue exemplifies this dynamic. It’s a “meat and potatoes deal” that provides decent returns but doesn’t generate life-changing wealth for investors. OpenAI’s revelation that stock-based compensation exceeded 119% of revenue last year highlights a critical issue facing high-growth companies. While the accounting can be misleading (based on 409A valuations rather than actual dilution), the trend signals dangerous territory for many startups. The Churchill Principle As Jason Lemkin eloquently put it: “No one ever said to Winston Churchill, did you bring World War Two in on budget? They just said, did you win World War II? When it becomes existential, you do what you have to do to win.” This philosophy is driving companies to prioritize market dominance over financial efficiency, leading to unsustainable compensation inflation that will impact venture returns for years. CoreWeave’s $9 billion acquisition of Core Scientific demonstrates sophisticated use of inflated stock prices. By converting rental expenses into equity dilution, they’ve reduced fixed costs while maintaining upside exposure to data center demand. This move shows how companies with high-multiple stocks can strategically de-risk their business models. Canva’s “AI Discovery Week” – requiring all 5,000 employees to pause regular work and learn AI – represents a gentler approach to what many see as an inevitable reckoning. The speakers were divided on this approach: The underlying message is clear: companies can’t afford to carry employees who resist AI adoption. The podcast’s analysis of recession probabilities and market dynamics revealed sophisticated thinking about current risks: The discussion reveals several critical strategic imperatives: Perhaps most sobering was the discussion of venture capital’s current challenges. Deal volume has hit an eight-year low while spectacular successes capture all attention and capital. This creates a “flight to consensus” where: The speakers agreed that most VCs are spending their time managing disappointing portfolio companies from 2020-2021 that are growing at 10-30% rather than the explosive rates initially projected. The conversation painted a picture of an industry in transition, where traditional rules no longer apply: The overarching theme is clear: we’re witnessing the emergence of a two-tier market where AI-enabled companies with top talent operate in a different league from traditional businesses. For SaaS leaders, the choice is stark – transform or risk irrelevance in an increasingly AI-driven world. Jason on talent reality: “I was with the founder this morning of a multi-billion dollar company… they said my single biggest challenge today is cursor… cursor’s just paying insane amounts of money for everyone.” Harry on employee expectations: “If you need a discovery week for AI, you have people who aren’t curious enough to want to progress and running their job… I said you fire them.” Rory on the Churchill principle: “No one ever said to Winston Churchill, did you bring World War Two in on budget? They just said, did you win World War II? When it becomes existential, you do what you have to do to win.” Rory on recession probability: “Booms don’t die of old age… just because it’s been great for six or seven years doesn’t mean that it has to die in the eight.” Companies that act decisively on talent, AI adoption, and strategic positioning will thrive, while those clinging to old playbooks risk being left behind in what promises to be the most transformative period in business software history.

That distinction could become more important, as firms’ experimentation with security-based tokens potentially leaves investors confused—a concern raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this week. A stock that’s natively tokenized on Ethereum, for example, would carry the same set entitlements that investors receive when purchasing stock through traditional means, like voting or dividend rights, Domingo said. Natively tokenized assets also have no counterparty risk, while avoiding any fragmentation issues, he added. BlackRock’s $2.8 billion USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which Securitize helped introduce last year, is natively tokenized because, as the asset manager’s transfer agent, the firm manages and records the fund’s shares directly on-chain, Domingo explained. Transfer agents usually use proprietary databases instead of a blockchain. “The token represents 100% of the security,” Domingo said, pointing to crypto software platform Exodus’ stock as another example. “One token represents one share.” Exodus shares began trading as tokens on Securitize’s platform in 2022, but this year, interest in tokenization has renewed, with Robinhood unveiling tokenized stock trading on Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Arbitrum last month, and Kraken pushing xStocks on Solana and other networks like BNB Chain. In a statement on Tuesday, SEC Commissioner and crypto task force boss Hester Peirce recommended that firms structuring tokenized offerings, given their obligation to adhere to federal securities laws, should consider meeting with the regulator. Tokenization does not provide an exemption from existing rules and regulations, she underscored. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” she wrote. “Tokenized securities are still securities.” Anthony Tu-Sekine, a partner at Seward and Kissel LLP who leads the firm’s blockchain and digital assets practice, told Decrypt that the conversation around tokenization pertains to crypto, but at the end of the day, it’s about policing securities under existing securities laws. “People sometimes feel that, because of the nature of the blockchain, crypto should be less regulated,” he said. “That’s not what we’re talking about here.” In some ways, Peirce’s statement represented a warning to investors, not long after ChatGPT maker OpenAI denounced Robinhood’s move to offer so-called stock tokens in Europe that are tied to equity in the tech darling. In response, Robinhood said its tokens give "indirect exposure to private markets” as “tokenized contracts that follow their price.” Indeed, Pierce said in her recent statement that a tokenized security, depending on the circumstances, could resemble “security entitlements” or a “security-based swap,” as opposed to equity in any private or public company. Robinhood’s stock tokens possess some features that appear aimed at creating a controlled environment for the product. U.S. customers are barred from buying stock tokens, they can’t be sent to other wallets or platforms, and users must be KYC-verified via identifying information. Kraken doesn’t allow U.S. customers to purchase xStocks either, but the tokens, which are issued by a firm called Backed, are permissionless, meaning that they can be freely traded on a decentralized exchange or independently adopted by any platform. As the SEC urges market participants to consider federal securities, the regulator is trying to stick to a collaborative approach to crypto under U.S. President Donald Trump, as reflected by a roundtable discussion on tokenization hosted by the SEC in May. “In recent history, we seem to have forgotten a very fundamental concept: that investors and issuers have valuable observations and experiences,” SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, and now-defunct crypto exchange FTX once dabbled in tokenized stock trading—but those products were ultimately shelved. Crypto lending platform Abra began offering contracts as tokens to customers in 2019 that allowed them to gain exposure to price moments of certain U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds. The company “voluntarily ceased offering” the tokens after cooperating with an SEC investigation, according to a CFTC filing. In 2020, the SEC and CFTC ordered Abra to pay each agency a $150,000 penalty for allegedly offering unregistered securities and engaging in unlawful off-exchange swaps trading. Abra agreed, “without admitting or denying the findings.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Share this article Aptos Labs, the development team behind the Aptos layer 1 blockchain, has appointed Solomon Tesfaye as its new Chief Business Officer, strengthening its executive team at a time of rapid growth in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and institutional blockchain adoption. Tesfaye previously served as Head of Capital Markets at Aptos, where he led efforts to connect the blockchain to traditional financial players. His leadership enabled Aptos to build partnerships with institutions including BlackRock, Apollo, and Franklin Templeton, helping to position the network for deployment in crypto ETPs and ETFs in both the US and Europe. “Solomon has been critical in shaping our Global Trading Engine vision and forging the partnerships that will help make it a reality,” said Avery Ching, Co-Founder and CEO at Aptos Labs. “As CBO, he’ll be key to scaling that work, bringing more institutions, markets, and real-world use cases onto Aptos as global web3 adoption continues to accelerate.” With more than a decade’s experience in investment banking, venture capital, and digital asset strategy, Tesfaye is expected to lead Aptos Labs’ push into financial services infrastructure, institutional onboarding, and scalable tokenization. His focus will include driving global enterprise partnerships in fintech, payments, and asset management, advancing strategic initiatives and business development, opening new markets and use cases for on-chain finance. Aptos is expected to benefit from pro-crypto policies under the Trump administration, which promise improved regulatory clarity and enhanced support for crypto businesses. “With the US nearing the completion of frameworks for next-generation financial services, Aptos Labs is well-positioned to lead the shift to on-chain assets and help shape the infrastructure of tomorrow’s global markets,” said Tesfaye in a statement. “I’m excited to forge the partnerships and integrations that institutions and other market participants need to fully harness Aptos’ tokenization capabilities at scale.” The leadership change comes amid accelerating adoption, as Aptos surpasses $540 million in tokenized real-world assets, with institutional integrations having doubled since the start of 2025.

Title: AMD's Latest AI Chips Are on Par With Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs, HSBC Says
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/amd-s-latest-ai-chips-are-on-par-with-nvidia-s-blackwell-gpus-hsbc-says-11769625
Time Published: 2025-07-10T16:04:30Z

The performance of Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) latest AI chips is on par with those from Silicon Valley rival Nvidia's (NVDA), HSBC analysts said. In a note Thursday, HSBC analysts upgraded their rating on AMD to a “buy” from a “hold” and doubled their price target to $200, noting that AMD's latest series of chips can compete with Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs. AMD launched its Instinct MI350 Series GPUs last month, claiming the chips offered four times more computing power than its previous generation. “With the recent launch of the MI350 series, we were pleasantly surprised with the performance upgrades which imply that the MI350 series can compete with Nvidia latest-gen HGX B200 AI GPU,” HSBC analysts wrote. "Owing to the performance enhancements, the pricing premium is much higher than expected earlier which could help drive upside to earnings in 2025 and 2026." The analysts, led by Frank Lee, also wrote that there was further upside possible for AMD shares when the chipmaker launches its MI400 series next year, which could compete with Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin platform—scheduled for the second half of 2026. AMD unveiled the MI400 last month in an event hosted by CEO Lisa Su and Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, which has signed on as a customer for the next-gen chips. AMD shares are rising more than 4% to $144 in early Thursday trading, having gained around a fifth of their value this year. Shares in Nvidia, which briefly became the world’s most valuable company with an over $4 trillion market cap Wednesday, are little changed.

Title: EFF's Guide to Getting Records About Axon's Draft One AI-Generated Police Reports
URL: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/effs-guide-getting-records-about-axons-ai-generated-police-reports
Time Published: 2025-07-10T16:00:24Z
Full Content:
The moment Axon Enterprise announced a new product, Draft One, that would allow law enforcement officers to use artificial intelligence to automatically generate incident report narratives based on body-worn camera audio, everyone in the police accountability community immediately started asking the same questions. What do AI-generated police reports look like? What kind of paper trail does this system leave? How do we get a hold of documentation using public records laws? Unfortunately, obtaining these records isn't easy. In many cases, it's straight-up impossible. Read our full report on how Axon's Draft One defies transparency expectations by design here. In some jurisdictions, the documents are walled off behind government-created barriers. For example, California fully exempts police narrative reports from public disclosure, while other states charge fees to access individual reports that become astronomical if you want to analyze the output in bulk. Then there are technical barriers: Axon's product itself does not allow agencies to isolate reports that contain an AI-generated narrative, although an agency can voluntarily institute measures to make them searchable by a keyword. This spring, EFF tested out different public records request templates and sent them to dozens of law enforcement agencies we believed are using Draft One. We asked each agency for the Draft One-generated police reports themselves, knowing that in most cases this would be a long shot. We also dug into Axon's user manuals to figure out what kind of logs are generated and how to carefully phrase our public records request to get them. We asked for the current system settings for Draft One, since there are a lot of levers police administrators can pull that drastically change how and when officers can use the software. We also requested the standard records that we usually ask for when researching new technologies: procurement documents, agreements, training manuals, policies, and emails with vendors. Like all mass public records campaigns, the results were… mixed. Some agencies were refreshingly open with their records. Others assessed us records fees well outside the usual range for a non-profit organization. What we learned about the process is worth sharing. Axon has thousands of clients nationwide that use its Tasers, body-worn cameras and bundles of surveillance equipment, and the company is using those existing relationships to heavily promote Draft One. We expect many more cities to deploy the technology over the next few years. Watchdogging police use of AI will require a nationwide effort by journalists, advocacy organizations and community volunteers. Below we’re sharing some sample language you can use in your own public records requests about Draft One — but be warned. It’s likely that the more you include, the longer it might take and the higher the fees will get. The template language and our suggestions for filing public records requests are not legal advice. If you have specific questions about a public records request you filed, consult a lawyer. Language to try in your public records request: Or If you are curious about a particular officer's Draft One usage, you can also ask for their reports specifically. However it may be helpful to obtain their usage log first (see section 2). We suggest using weeks, not months, because the sheer number of reports can get costly very quickly. As an add-on to Axon's evidence and records management platforms, Draft One uses ChatGPT to convert audio taken from Axon body-worn cameras into the so-called first draft of the narrative portion of a police report. When Politico surveyed seven agencies in September 2024, reporter Alfred Ng found that police administrators did not have the technical ability to identify which reports contained AI-generated language. As Ng reported. “There is no way for us to search for these on our end,” a Lafayette, IN police captain told Ng. Six months later, EFF received the same no-can-do response from the Lafayette Police Department. Although Lafayette Police could not create a list on their own, it turns out that Axon's engineers can generate these reports for police if asked. When the Frederick Police Department in Colorado received a similar request from Ng, the agency contacted Axon for help. The company does internally track reports written with Draft One and was able to provide a spreadsheet of Draft One reports (.csv) and even provided Frederick Police with computer code to allow the agency to create similar lists in the future. Axon told them they would look at making this a feature in the future, but that appears not to have happened yet. But we also struck gold with two agencies: the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office (PBCSO) in Florida and the Lake Havasu City Police Department in Arizona. In both cases, the agencies require officers to include a disclosure that they used Draft One at the end of the police narrative. Here's a slide from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Draft One training: And here's the boilerplate disclosure: I acknowledge this report was generated from a digital recording using Draft One by Axon. I further acknowledge that I have I reviewed the report, made any necessary edits, and believe it to be an accurate representation of my recollection of the reported events. I am willing to testify to the accuracy of this report. As small a gesture as it may seem, that disclosure makes all the difference when it comes to responding to a public records request. Lafayette Police could not isolate the reports because its policy does not require the disclosure. A Frederick Police Department sergeant noted in an email to Axon that they could isolate reports when the auto-disclosure was turned on, but not after they decided to turn it off. This year, Utah legislators introduced a bill to require this kind of disclosure on AI-generated reports. As the PBCSO records manager told us: "We are able to do a keyword and a timeframe search. I used the words ‘Draft One’ and the system generated all the Draft One reports for that timeframe." In fact, in Palm Beach County and Lake Havasu, records administrators dug up huge numbers of records. But, once we saw the estimated price tag, we ultimately narrowed our request to just 10 reports. Here is an example of a report from PBCSO, which only allows Draft One to be used in incidents that don't involve a criminal charge. As a result, many of the reports were related to mental health or domestic dispute responses. A machine readable text version of this report is available here. Full version here. And here is an example from the Lake Havasu City Police Department, whose clerk was kind enough to provide us with a diverse sample of requests. A machine readable text version of this report is available here. Full version here. EFF redacted some of these records to protect the identity of members of the public who were captured on body-worn cameras. Black-bar redactions were made by the agencies, while bars with X's were made by us. You can view all the examples we received below: We also received police reports (perhaps unintentionally) from two other agencies that were contained as email attachments in response to another part of our request (see section 7). Language to try in your public records request: Note: You can save time by determining in advance whether the agency uses Axon Evidence or Axon Records and Standards, then choose the applicable option below. If you don't know, you can always request both. Audit logs from Axon Evidence Or Audit logs from Axon Records and Axon Standards You could also tell the agency you are only interested in Draft One related items, which may save the agency time in reviewing and redacting the documents. Generally, many of the basic actions a police officer takes using Axon technology — whether it's signing in, changing a password, accessing evidence or uploading BWC footage — is logged in the system. This also includes some actions when an officer uses Draft One. However, the system only logs three types of activities: requesting that Draft One generate a report, signing a Draft One liability disclosure, or changing Draft One's settings. And these reports are one of the only ways to identify which reports were written with AI and how widely the technology is used. Unfortunately, Axon appears to have designed its system so that administrators cannot create a list of all Draft One activities taken by the entire police force. Instead, all they can do is view an individual officer's audit log to see when they used Draft One or look at the log for a particular piece of evidence to see if Draft One was used. These can be exported as a spreadsheet or a PDF. (When the Frederick Police Department asked Axon how to create a list of Draft One reports, the Axon rep told them that feature wasn't available and they would have to follow the above method. "To set expectations, it’s not going to be graceful, but this wasn’t a scenario we anticipated needing to make easy," Axon wrote in August 2024, then suggested it might come up with a long-term solution. We emailed Axon back in March to see if this was still the case, but they did not provide a response.) Here's an excerpt from a PDF version from the Bishop Police Department in California: Here are some additional audit log examples: If you know the name of an individual officer, you can try to request their audit logs to see if they used Draft One. Since we didn't have a particular officer in mind, we had to get creative. An agency may manage their documents with one of a few different Axon offerings: Axon Evidence, Axon Records, or Axon Standards. The process for requesting records is slightly different depending on which one is used. We dug through the user manuals and came up with a few ways to export a random(ish) example. We also linked the manuals and gave clear instructions for the records officers. With Axon Evidence, an administrator can simply sort the system to show the 10 most recent users then export their usage logs. With Axon Records/Standard, the administrator has to start typing in a name and then it auto-populates with suggestions. So, we ask them to export the audit logs for the first few users who came up when they typed the letters M, J, and S into the search (since those letters are common at the beginning of names). Unfortunately, this method is a little bit of a gamble. Many officers still aren't using Draft One, so you may end up with hundreds of pages of logs that don't mention Draft One at all (as was the case with the records we received from Monroe County, NY). Language to try in your public records request: We knew the Draft One system offers department managers the option to customize how it can be used, including the categories of crime for which reports can be generated and whether or not there is a disclaimer automatically added to the bottom of the report disclosing the use of AI in its generation. So we asked for a copy of these settings and configurations. In some cases, agencies claimed this was exempted from their public records laws, while other agencies did provide the information. Here is an example from the Campbell Police Department in California: (It's worth noting that while Campbell does require each police report to contain a disclosure that Draft One was used, the California Public Records Act exempts police reports from being released.) Examples of settings: Language to try in your public records request: It can be helpful to know how much Draft One costs, how many user licenses the agency paid for, and what the terms of the agreement are. That information is often contained in records related to the contracting process. Agencies will often provide these records with minimal pushback or redactions. Many of these records may already be online, so a requester can save time and effort by looking around first. These are often found in city council agenda packets. Also, law enforcement agencies often will bump these requests to the city or county clerk instead. Here's an excerpt from the Monroe County Sheriff's Office in New York: These kinds of procurement records describe the nature and cost of the relationship between the police department and the company. They can be very helpful for understanding how much a continuing service subscription will cost and what else was bundled in as part of the purchase. Draft One, so far, is often accessed as an additional feature along with other Axon products. We received too many documents to list them all, but here is a representative example of some of the other documents you might receive, courtesy of the Dacono Police Department in Colorado. All training materials relevant to Draft One or Axon Narrative Assistant generated by this agency, including but not limited to: In addition to seeing when Draft One was used and how it was acquired, it can be helpful to know what rules officers must follow, what directions they're given for using it, and what features are available to users. That's where manuals, policies and training materials come in handy. User manuals are typically going to come from Axon itself. In general, if you can get your hands on one, this will help you to better understand the mechanisms of the system, and it will help you align the way you craft your request with the way the system actually works. Luckily, Axon has published many of the materials online and we've already obtained the user manual from multiple agencies. However, Axon does update the manual from time to time, so it can be helpful to know which version the agency is working from. Here's one from December 2024: Dacono Police Department - Axon Draft One User Guide Policies are internal police department guidance for using Draft One. Not all agencies have developed a policy, but the ones they do have may reveal useful information, such as other records you might be able to request. Here are some examples: Training and user manuals also might reveal crucial information about how the technology is used. In some cases these documents are provided by Axon to the customer. These records may illuminate the specific direction that departments are emphasizing about using the product. Here are a few examples of training presentations: Language to try in your public records request: Many departments are getting access to Draft One as part of a trial or pilot program. The outcome of those experiments with the product can be eye-opening or eyebrow-raising. There might also be additional data or a formal report that reviews what the department was hoping to get from the experience, how they structured any evaluation of its time-saving value for the department, and other details about how officers did or did not use Draft One. Here are some examples we received: Language to try in your public records request: • All communications sent or received by any representative of this agency with individuals representing Axon referencing the following term, including emails and attachments: • All communications sent to or received by any representative of this agency with each of the following email addresses, including attachments: Note: We are not including the specific email addresses here that we used, since they are subject to change when employees are hired, promoted, or find new gigs. However, you can find the emails we used in our requests on MuckRock. The communications we wanted were primarily the emails between Axon and the law enforcement agency. As you can imagine, these emails could reveal the back-and-forth between the company and its potential customers, and these conversations could include the marketing pitch made to the department, the questions and problems police may have had with it, and more. In some cases, these emails reveal cozy relationships between salespeople and law enforcement officials. Take, for example, this email exchange between the Dickinson Police Department and an Axon rep: Or this email between a Frederick Police Department sergeant and an Axon representative, in which a sergeant describes himself as "doing sales" for Axon by providing demos to other agencies. A machine readable text version of this email is available here. Emails like this also show what other agencies are considering using Draft One in the future. For example, in this email we received from the Campbell Police Department shows that the San Francisco Police Department was testing Draft One as early as October 2024 (the usage was confirmed in June 2025 by the San Francisco Standard). A machine readable text version of this email is available here. Your mileage will certainly vary for these email requests, in part because the ability for agencies to search their communications can vary. Some agencies can search by a keyword like "Draft One” or "Axon" and while other agencies can only search by the specific email address. Communications can be one of the more expensive parts of the request. We've found that adding a date range and key terms or email addresses has helped limit these costs and made our requests a bit clearer for the agency. Axon sends a lot of automated emails to its subscribers, so the agency may quote a large fee for hundreds or thousands of emails that aren't particularly interesting. Many agencies respond positively if a requester reaches out to say they're open to narrowing or focusing their request. One of the big questions is how do the Draft One-generated reports compare to the BWC audio the narrative is based on? Are the reports accurate? Are they twisting people's words? Does Draft One hallucinate? Finding these answers requires both obtaining the police report and the footage of the incident that was fed into the system. The laws and process for obtaining BWC footage vary dramatically state to state, and even department to department. Depending on where you live, it can also get expensive very quickly, since some states allow agencies to charge you not only for the footage but the time it takes to redact the footage. So before requesting footage, read up on your state’s public access laws or consult a lawyer. However, once you have a copy of a Draft One report, you should have enough information to file a follow-up request for the BWC footage. So far, EFF has not requested BWC footage. In addition to the aforementioned financial and legal hurdles, the footage can implicate both individual privacy and transparency regarding police activity. As an organization that advocates for both, we want to make sure we get this balance right. Afterall, BWCs are a surveillance technology that collects intelligence on suspects, victims, witnesses, and random passersby. When the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office gave us an AI-generated account of a teenager being hospitalized for suicidal ideations, we of course felt that the minor's privacy outweighed our interest in evaluating the AI. But do we feel the same way about a Draft One-generated narrative about a spring break brawl in Lake Havasu? Ultimately, we may try to obtain a limited amount of BWC footage, but we also recognize that we shouldn't make the public wait while we work it out for ourselves. Accountability requires different methods, different expertise, and different interests, and with this guide we hope to not only shine light on Draft One, but to provide the schematics for others–including academics, journalists, and local advocates–to build their own spotlights to expose police use of this problematic technology. Despite the variation in how agencies responded, we did have some requests that proved fruitful. You can find these requests and the documents we got via the linked police department names below. Please note that we filed two different types of requests, so not all the elements above may be represented in each link.

Title: Wall Street’s advice after Nvidia hits historic $4 trillion market cap: BUY

Paolo Confino is a reporter on Fortune’s global news desk where he covers each day’s most important stories. Wall Street is betting Nvidia can make stock market history again. After the chipmaker powered its way to a $4 trillion valuation, the first company to ever reach the milestone, analysts still see room for the stock to grow. The upside for Nvidia, according to its biggest bulls, remains incomplete. There are more returns to be had, they argue. Nvidia is one of the most beloved stocks by investors. It seems to have ridden the stock market exuberance of AI more than any other company. Investors continue to reiterate its strength as the purveyor of the best AI chips that hyperscalers like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon use. Of the 79 analysts who currently follow Nvidia, 69 rate it a buy, according to Bloomberg. That’s good for an 87% buy rating among analysts. Only 11 rate it a hold. And just one lone holdout lists it as a sell. On Thursday, after Nvidia hit the $4 trillion mark, some analysts were unfazed at the prospect that perhaps the chipmaker had reached its stock market peak. At least three analysts published new reports rating the stock a buy, according to Bloomberg data. Goldman Sachs, Keybanc Capital Markets, and Bocom International, the subsidiary of Hong Kong’s Bank of Communications, all listed Nvidia as either a buy or an overweight. Their price targets ranged from $175 to $190, implying growth of between 8.1% and 17.4% for Nvidia stock from the $161.84 per share at the time of publication. Despite Nvidia’s valuation, its fundamentals don’t point to an expensive or overpriced stock, according to Paul Meeks, chief investment officer at 17 Asset Management. “The stock has come far, but sales, earnings, and cash flows have come farther,” he told Fortune. Indeed, Nvidia has delivered outstanding financial performance. Its latest quarterly earnings saw it bringing $44 billion in revenue, a 69% increase from the prior year, according to company filings. Its margins remain plump, coming in at 60% over the same quarter. Its balance sheet remains rock-solid with $111 billion in total assets compared to $32 billion in total liabilities in its 2025 fiscal year. Goldman was undeterred by Nvidia’s recent record valuation. It called worries about Nvidia’s sky-high price “peak concerns” in an analyst note published on Thursday. “We believe Nvidia will remain the primary beneficiary of the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout,” Goldman semiconductor analyst James Schneider wrote. Analysts built their bull case for Nvidia around the fact that it remains the market leader in all the components used to develop AI systems and that the market for all of those products will only grow over the next few years. Nvidia has also spent the last couple years diversifying its offerings. “Nvidia’s well beyond the chips,” Meeks said. The company also has a suite of software and networking gear used for things like gaming and developing robotics. Nvidia’s believers also often point to early signs that AI companies are finally starting to monetize the technology. Once that happens, demand for Nvidia’s products will only grow. AI firms have already started to push further into the consumer tech market. Perplexity released an AI-powered web browser and OpenAI is slated to launch one soon. Major cloud service providers like Amazon and Alphabet will also start to incorporate more AI tech into their services which will only further boost Nvidia’s sales, according to longtime tech bull Dan Ives. “The impact of the AI cycle on consumer Internet will be massive and it will start with the cloud service divisions,” Ives wrote on Thursday. “[Amazon and Alphabet] acquire AI-capable chips, build AI-capable service offerings, and sell those services into their respective installed bases.” But Nvidia’s fate is ultimately linked to that of its biggest customers. As they continue to spend, the stock will continue to soar. The day that they pull back their billions in AI investments is the day Nvidia’s gets “crushed,” Meeks said. “Only thing that would cause a bloodletting here is if we got a sense that major AI spenders pull back,” he said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Airbnb Host Refuses To Let Renters Stay In The Unit They Reserved, So They Complain To Airbnb Who Kicks The Host Off The App

by Jayne Elliott Shutterstock/Reddit It used to be that if you wanted to travel somewhere and needed a place to stay, you had to stay in a hotel, but websites like Airbnb have changed that. Now, there are a lot more options! The problem with sites like Airbnb is that not all rentals and not all rental hosts are created equal. I’ve used Airbnb multiple times and had great experiences, but there have been a couple times I thought, “I’ll never stay there again!” Thankfully, I’ve never had an experience as bad as the guy who wrote this story. His experience is so bad that he had to complain to Airbnb about it multiple times to gets the problem resolved, but in the end, it did get resolved in everyone’s favor except the Airbnb host! Let’s see what happens. In around 2019 I had a friend coming to visit for Paddy’s Day. Now I’m Irish, but he’s actually from Hong Kong. Given that I’m local, I said I’d take care of booking accommodation etc. I went on and of course as usual everything was like half a grand (welcome to Dublin…). Obviously things were maxed out due to it being Paddy’s Weekend. But I found one spot in Blackrock, which isn’t in the city centre but is only a few stops away on the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit), that was going for €68 per night! I booked it right then and there. Then something weird happened. The following morning I got a notification from AirBNB saying the host wanted to up the price by €288.28, and if I would accept that. I clicked no and figured hey, he’s already accepted our booking, I don’t have to say yes to this! I waited the few weeks until the weekend in question, and then it came. My friend landed at Dublin Airport, we made our way to Blackrock, got to the door, rang the doorbell, and… nothing. This is even weirder. There was no car in the driveway, nobody was home. We hung around for forty minutes until the host arrived, and he wouldn’t. Even. Look us in the eye. I said hi, we’ve a booking to stay here this weekend? And he mumbled something about how no one was staying there sorry and he went inside. Airbnb tried to make it right. Well I got straight onto AirBNB. They offered us our money back, and I said no, that’s not good enough, everywhere else is half a grand what are we going to do with €68? So they offered us double, and I still said no, we need a place to stay! So they booked us into a lovely house elsewhere that was closer to the city centre. It gets even better! But that’s not all. I made an official complaint about the host and how he screwed us over, and they booted him off the app! For trying to fleece a couple of twenty-something lads, he had to stop renting his place out entirely! I’m a petty guy, so every couple of months I randomly think about this and check to see if he’s back online yet. As of May 2025, he’s still not. So I’ve cost him over six years of AirBNB rent (and counting). You love to see it. That Airbnb host really should’ve just let the guys rent the place for the agreed upon price. Let’s see how Reddit reacted to this story. Here’s the perspective of someone who hasn’t used Airbnb. A former Airbnb host shares hatred for the service. This person finds the request to pay more pretty unusual. It’s possible the host listed the unit somewhere else. Or maybe the host sold the rental. At least Airbnb made it right for the renter. That’s something. If you liked that post, check out this post about a woman who tracked down a contractor who tried to vanish without a trace.

Title: Meta is trying to win the AI race with money — but not everyone can be bought

﻿Zuckerberg is picking off top talent from across the industry, and OpenAI might be more vulnerable than most. ﻿Zuckerberg is picking off top talent from across the industry, and OpenAI might be more vulnerable than most. Month after month, message after message, the AI engineer was hearing from Meta recruiters. The recruiters were pestering him to leave his employer and switch over to support the company’s AI efforts, and they were offering a sizable salary package to do so. But he wasn’t so sure. The engineer, who works for a startup that was acquired by a leading AI company and requested anonymity from The Verge, said he had heard from friends that the company expected a lot of personal sacrifices in exchange for its high salaries, whether on employees’ value systems when it comes to Al or work-life balance. Engineers there, he heard, were working around the clock to catch up with rival companies like OpenAl, Anthropic, Google, and Microsoft. With so many firms desperately scrambling for AI talent, Meta was offering between $1–1.4 million in total annual compensation (which is typically measured as a combination of salary, annual bonus, and amortized stock value) for many AI roles. But, he suspected, its offers might be less generous than they sounded — tied heavily to subjective performance metrics that could be weaponized against employees. And just as importantly, he wasn’t willing to give up a semblance of work-life balance and a healthy work environment to make a few hundred thousand dollars more. He didn’t pursue the opportunity. In recent months, Meta has launched on an AI hiring spree after making its largest-ever external investment: a $14.3 billion acquisition of a 49 percent stake in Scale AI, an industry giant that provides training data to fuel the technology of companies like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Meta. As part of the deal, Meta spun up a brand-new superintelligence lab led by Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang — and to staff the lab, it started poaching. Meta has reportedly poached as many as 10 of OpenAI’s top researchers and model developers, with some pay packages reportedly adding up to $300 million over four years, including equity. (Meta disputes this figure.) It’s also approached a slew of other top AI talent across the industry. Ruoming Pang, who heads up Apple’s foundation AI models team, reportedly departed for Meta, and at least two Anthropic employees and two DeepMind employees have reportedly joined the team as well. The goal is to secure Meta’s spot in the race to achieve artificial general intelligence, or AGI: a hypothetical AI system that equals or surpasses human cognitive abilities, and the moving target that almost every AI company is currently chasing at breakneck speed. Meta’s primary weapon is vast amounts of money. But some sources across the AI industry question whether that will be enough. Meta, to date, has not been the most exciting destination for budding AI engineers Meta, to date, has not been the most exciting destination for budding AI engineers. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been trying to make up for lost ground in the AI race, having spent years and significant resources over-indexing on the metaverse while competitors like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon invested billions in AI startups and signed cloud contracts and other deals. The company’s Llama AI models often rank low on publicly maintained performance leaderboards; at time of writing, Meta’s first appearance on one such leaderboard, Chatbot Arena, was at No. 30. In May, it reportedly delayed the launch of its new flagship AI model as developers struggled to deliver performance upgrades, and executives have been public on earnings calls about the need to aggressively invest and shore up against competition. The Scale AI deal, and Meta’s subsequent sky-high budget for hiring AI talent, is Zuckerberg’s Hail Mary: paying a premium for some of the brightest minds in the AI world to safeguard Meta’s future. But although Meta is plying AI workers with staggering salaries, a mountain of money can’t buy everyone. Anthropic and DeepMind have reportedly had far fewer defections to Meta than OpenAI has, and that’s been an ongoing trend. The reason, to those inside the field, is obvious: the AI world is filled with true believers, and even the biggest companies need more than a cash offer to get many of them on their side. Industry insiders emphasized to The Verge that in a sector where almost any company will offer job security and a good salary, experienced AI engineers and researchers want to work somewhere that aligns with their values, whether their top priority is AI safety and the risks the tech poses for humanity’s future, the ethical considerations of AI’s impact on society today, or accelerating and advancing the tech quicker than anyone else. Some engineers, researchers, or scientists the company has approached have turned down Meta’s advances, industry sources tell The Verge. Competition for AI researchers is stiff, and building loyalty is vital. “At this point, at least a few hundred top researchers and engineers in the field are what’s sometimes called ‘post-money’ — they could retire, and you’re only going to attract or retain them if they believe in your vision, leadership style, etc.,” one AI industry source says. But especially at OpenAI, Meta seems to have found the dollar value of company loyalty — and exceeded it. OpenAI has been uniquely affected by Meta’s mission to poach leading AI talent. As many as 10 of its top researchers and model developers have reportedly joined Meta, with some receiving large signing bonuses and equity. While its size and talent make it an inevitable prime target, the company is also vulnerable due to a controversial restructuring from a nonprofit to for-profit venture and the departures of high-profile executives who went on to start competing AI companies. It underwent a huge upheaval during Sam Altman’s November 2023 ouster by OpenAI’s board and his subsequent Uno Reverse-style rehiring, which saw most of the board members who opposed him resign. Employees have also shared concerns about non-disparagement agreements and policies that raised questions about whether they would be able to access their equity, eroding some trust in leadership even when the policies were walked back. “A lot of the people working on this are genuinely convinced they’re building transformative technology that will reshape the world,” one source familiar with the situation tells The Verge. “For the people that were that mission-driven, there’s already been so much organizational turbulence” — he mentioned Altman’s firing and rehiring, OpenAI employees defecting to Anthropic, and governance changes — “that people are less anchored to the institution itself, so it’s easier to poach [from OpenAI] than the other labs.” In lieu of an official comment, OpenAI directed The Verge to a blog post from its global affairs team, which states, “Some eye-popping offers are being extended these days to a handful of terrifically talented researchers, including to folks at OpenAI. Some of these offers are coming with deadlines of just a few hours – literally ‘exploding offers’ – or with restrictions on whether or how they can be discussed.” The blog post goes on to say the company plans to cultivate talent across not just research, but also product, engineering, infrastructure, scaling, and safety. On Wednesday, the company announced it had hired four engineers away from companies like Tesla, xAI, and Meta. Now, OpenAI’s best defense against the losses is its own financial leverage. People that joined OpenAI early on, or even before the end of 2023, have had significant stock appreciation — the unit price jumped from $67 in a May 2023 tender offer to $210 at the end of 2024, according to a source familiar with the situation. And during the end of 2023, around the time of the OpenAI board roller coaster, there was a window in which OpenAI rushed to make hires from other companies who would sign on at the $67-per-unit figure, since there was a near-immediate 2.5x multiplier expected, the source says. With so many companies competing to hire AI talent, there have been high-level departures at many different companies. But even before this most recent hiring frenzy, OpenAI’s employees were being lured elsewhere at a higher-than-average rate. A 2025 SignalFire report analyzed retention patterns in AI and found that Anthropic was best at keeping people around, with 80 percent of employees hired at least two years ago at Anthropic remaining at the company at the conclusion of their second year. DeepMind came next at 78 percent, while OpenAI’s retention rate was markedly lower, at 67 percent — comparable to Meta’s 64 percent. The report, which came out in May before Meta’s Scale deal occurred, also found that engineers were “8 times more likely to leave OpenAI for Anthropic than the reverse,” and 11 times more likely to defect from DeepMind to Anthropic than the reverse. Anthropic was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives with the goal of carefully developing AI technology, describing itself as an “AI safety and research company that’s working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.” The company’s “mission-driven safety focus” is a convincing recruitment pitch and a key reason for its low turnover, one source familiar with the situation tells The Verge. “The priorities of the companies become very different, and it’s not something that they’re happy with” “I’ve seen, amongst people who are a little bit more seasoned in industry … they have watched tech as an industry change, and they’ve watched the people in the industry become very different, and the priorities of the companies become very different, and it’s not something that they’re happy with,” says Rumman Chowdhury, a longtime leader in the field of responsible AI at companies like Accenture and Twitter, who now heads up the AI nonprofit Humane Intelligence. When she’s hiring AI engineers, she says, they often say that salary hikes are less important to them than to “not be contributing to a worse world.” AI engineers and researchers can afford that idealism, and concerns about safety and the rush to commercialize the technology have dogged most leading AI companies. At OpenAI, for instance, months of controversy and public pressure about its upcoming transition into a for-profit entity led to the company changing its plans, ceding some control to its nonprofit arm even after the restructuring. The decision followed a public letter written by ex-employees and civic leaders to the California and Delaware attorneys general, with one former employee writing, “OpenAI may one day build technology that could get us all killed.” There are questions, too, about the pace at which Meta is moving and its research priorities. Meta’s Scale AI investment came on the heels of Joelle Pineau’s departure as Meta VP and head of its Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) division, a unit Meta folded into its larger AI efforts after previously describing it as “one of the only groups in the world with all the prerequisites for delivering true breakthroughs with some of the brightest minds in the industry.” Some saw FAIR’s restructuring as a sign that Meta was prioritizing products over research, an industry-wide concern for some AI safety experts. For Meta, however, there are also pragmatic questions about its future in AI. In conversations with The Verge, industry insiders questioned whether Wang is the right choice to head the new lab, since Scale AI does not build frontier models and Wang himself doesn’t have an AI research background. And even Meta executives admit that catching up will be a challenge. During its most recent earnings call in April, Zuckerberg — who called one of Meta’s focuses for 2025 “making Meta AI the leading personal AI” — touched on the competition he was up against. “The pace of progress across the industry and the opportunities ahead for us are staggering. I want to make sure that we’re working aggressively and efficiently, and I also want to make sure that we are building out the leading infrastructure and teams we need to achieve our goals,” he said. Just two months later, that team became Meta’s superintelligence lab. But the AI engineer who steered clear doesn’t regret his decision. “You’re expected to give pretty much your whole self to Meta AI,” he says. The money simply wasn’t good enough for that.

US Stock Market Today saw the Dow rise while the Nasdaq dipped as investors balanced Nvidia’s $4 trillion milestone with new Trump tariff threats. Nvidia (NVDA) led recent tech gains, but President Trump’s warning of 50% tariffs on Brazil and threats to other countries stirred fresh concerns. Delta Airlines (DAL) jumped 12% after strong Q2 earnings. Meanwhile, jobless claims dropped to 227,000, keeping hopes alive for a possible Fed rate cut. As AI momentum grows and global trade faces uncertainty, Wall Street is watching both Nvidia’s rise and Trump’s aggressive trade push very closely.

Learn more and register today. – Sarah Morton Two years ago, I took on the role of editor for Crypto for Advisors at a pivotal moment. It was mid-2023, and the cryptocurrency industry was in the midst of a deep winter. The collapse of major lending platforms and the implosion of FTX had sent shockwaves through the markets. The U.S. regulatory climate was hostile, marked by enforcement-first tactics, and confidence was shaken. But even then, the undercurrents of something bigger were impossible to ignore. Fast forward to today, and we’re standing on the edge of what Bank of America calls a “once-in-a-millennium transformation.” They’re not talking about memes or speculation. They’re talking about the reshaping of global financial infrastructure, economic models, and digital ownership — and it’s being driven by crypto. An Ode to Bitcoin: The Genesis “Bitcoin belongs in the same breath as the printing press and artificial intelligence.” — Bank of America: Bitcoin, born in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, created something revolutionary: a decentralized, fixed-supply digital currency. It belonged to no government, no corporation, and no central authority. From there, a movement began. Early adoption saw students tinkering with GPUs, developers building wallets, entrepreneurs launching exchanges, and miners chasing cheap power around the globe. A technological and economic revolution took shape. Today, we’re seeing bitcoin ETFs from the world’s largest asset managers — BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale being the top three by AUM — and even nation-state adoption as countries like the U.S. and UAE race to become global crypto hubs. It’s an unparalleled acceleration of financial innovation. The Rise of Ethereum and Smart Contracts Bitcoin sparked the fire, but Ethereum — and the smart contract innovation it introduced — brought utility, programmability, and the ability to tokenize everything: real estate, carbon credits, fine art, identity, equities, and even yield-generating protocols. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, tens of thousands of digital assets exist. And while investing grabs the spotlight, blockchain is quietly transforming supply chains, intellectual property, finance, and more. Public companies are adding crypto to their balance sheets. Over 140 public firms have announced bitcoin reserves. Exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken will offer tokenized equities, while retail platforms like Robinhood expand their crypto products. Access points are multiplying: direct-to-consumer platforms, ETFs (now in the hundreds), tokenized funds, and direct ownership. And the list keeps growing. The Landscape Has Changed — Are You Adopting? Only a handful of advisors were very early adopters but that’s slowly evolving. There’s broadening recognition of the opportunity — to support clients, protect relationships, and win new business. It's becoming increasingly common to hear from advisors that they are winning clients simply because they’re willing to talk about bitcoin. On the other hand, the lack of regulation, prohibitive firm policies, digital assets volatility behavior and overall uncertainty with a new asset class has caused hesitancy. Moreover, advisors have a lot to pay attention to —- and now learning a new — and always changing — asset class is added to the list! Despite all of this, clients want to access digital assets. Recent Coinshares survey data highlights that clients want the help of their advisors and expect them to be knowledgeable in digital assets. More than 80% of the respondents answered that they would be more likely to work with an advisor that offers digital asset guidance, and 78% of non-crypto investors say they’d turn to an advisor if crypto support were available. Notably, almost 90% said they planned to increase their crypto exposure in 2025. A Call to Action Blockchain is an infrastructure, crypto is more than an asset class and the technology extends well beyond investing. The industry is maturing,regulation is advancing andthe world’s largest institutions are developing on blockchain. As U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said recently, “Crypto is the most important phenomenon happening in the world today.” You don’t need to be a crypto trader or blockchain developer. But if you’re a fiduciary — a guide, a planner — you owe it to your clients to understand what’s happening. Education is key. In two years of curating this newsletter, I’ve watched sentiment shift from skepticism to curiosity to strategic integration. And we’re just getting started. I’m thrilled to be here with you on your crypto journey. Connect with me for ideas on future topics you’d like to see addressed. - Sarah Morton, chief strategy officer, MeetAmi Innovations Inc. Q. Why is the same digital asset priced differently on each exchange? A. Equities “plug in” to an exchange, allowing for one, centralized price. Crypto, on the contrary, is “decentralized.” This means there’s not one “plug” to price a digital asset. While crypto prices are based on supply and demand (as well as other factors), each exchange operates independently and therefore prices can vary between different exchanges. Q. How can I find reliable pricing data for digital assets? A. There are many digital asset index and data providers. Look for pricing that (1) comes from a reputable and trusted provider with a proven track record in digital assets, (2) has a transparent and rules-based approach to construction, and (3) lays out thoughtfully constructed criteria for how the pricing is captured. The index methodology is incredibly important. For example, if selection criteria of an index included “trading on more than one eligible exchange” with eligibility thoughtfully designed, then in the case of the FTX collapse, FTT (the exchange token of FTX) wouldn’t have made it into the index. Thoughtful construction can rule out bad actors. Q. Why are people using bitcoin to measure the entire digital asset landscape? A. While bitcoin now accounts for 65% of the total digital asset market, there were times bitcoin was less than 40% of the market. One asset should not be a benchmark for the entire asset class. Diversification is key for institutional investors to manage volatility and capture broader opportunities. Effective benchmarking must serve multiple constituencies—enabling performance evaluation, supporting investment strategies, and setting industry standards for everyone. Indices such as CoinDesk 5 (CD5), CoinDesk 20 (CD20), CoinDesk 80 (CD80), CoinDesk 100 (CD100) and CoinDesk Memecoin (CDMEME) were constructed to meet the needs of those looking to benchmark, trade and/or invest in the ever-evolving digital asset landscape. - Kim Klemballa, CoinDesk Indices Keep Reading Kim Greenberg Klemballa contributed reporting.

Title: ‘The Math Just Doesn’t Work’ – Analyst Hits JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs With Downgrade, Says Downside Risk Not Factored In

HSBC is detailing its major downgrade of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. On Tuesday, HSBC dropped its recommendation on JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) from hold to reduce. The firm also downgraded the recommendation on Bank of America from buy to hold. In an interview, HSBC’s head of US financials research, Saul Martinez, says the banks have solid fundamentals, but their valuations raise concerns. “We were not adopting a more negative view of operating fundamentals. We still think that net interest income is on the right track. You know, you are seeing some growth there. Obviously, there are some nuances to each of the downgrades, JPMorgan, Goldman to reduce and Bank of America to hold, but at a high level, it’s valuation. Pricing is not factoring in downside risk and the dilutive impact of buybacks at much higher multiples.” Martinez says he was not convinced that JPMorgan deserves its price. “In JPMorgan’s case, I think the math just doesn’t work at these valuations. The stock, so with banks, you look at price to tangible book value multiples and return on tangible common equity. Higher ROTC (return on tangible common equity), higher price to tangible. JPMorgan is trading close to three times tangible. That is a very elevated multiple.” He says it’s a similar case for Goldman Sachs. “We feel like we’re swimming against the tide with Goldman a little bit because the investment banking landscape is good. The risk-reward is very skewed here. We think good news is priced in, but again, if the market cools off and IB (investment banking) activity doesn’t really move forward, we don’t get a super cycle in IB activity, I think there’s more room for disappointment here than for upside.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Bitcoin Blasts to $112,017 ATH – What’s the Best Crypto to Buy Before the Next Surge?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. After hovering below the $110K mark over the past few weeks, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high yesterday. Bolstered by growing institutional adoption, $BTC is stronger than ever. And that means now’s the time to buy crypto before the next surge. $BTC finally reached the $100K milestone late last year, before outdoing itself in May, when it reached $111,970. Making it to $112,017 is another first for the crypto OG. Make no mistake, Lady Luck played no hand in Bitcoin’s surge. It’s down to an ever-growing list of financial institutions worldwide that are recognizing the value of $BTC, due in part to supportive government policies. Bitcoin champion Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy, argues that Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period. In fact, he told Bloomberg in a June 10 interview that he believes that $BTC will be $1M. “The President of the United States supports Bitcoin. The Cabinet supports Bitcoin. [Treasury Secretary] Scott Bessent supports Bitcoin. Paul Atkins has shown himself to be enthusiastic about bitcoin and digital assets. Brian Quintenz at CFTC feels that the banks will custody Bitcoin.” Saylor explained that Bitcoin Treasury companies are buying $BTC’s natural supply. In addition, “BlackRock and the ETFs are buying another measure of that, and we’ve got nation-state actors coming into the space. The writing is on the wall. Bitcoin is moving higher.” Take GameStop, for instance. It made waves in May by greenlighting Bitcoin buys at the board level. Soon after, GameStop purchased 4.71K Bitcoin. And for its part, the Trump Media and Technology Group is also eyeing a blended crypto ETF. Dubbed the “Crypto Blue Chip ETF,” it plans to offer exposure to five digital assets. Some 70% of the ETF’s holdings will be in $BTC, 15% in $ETH, 8% in $SOL, and 5% in $XRP. The remaining 2% of the ETF’s holdings will be in $CRO – the native token of the ETF’s digital custodian, the exchange Crypto.com. With fresh ETF inflows, increased corporate balance sheet exposure, the rise of crypto futures, and a more favorable regulatory environment, $BTC is experiencing a powerful surge in institutional interest. And the momentum shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. So, if you’re wondering which crypto to buy before the next big surge, you’re in the right place. Here are three altcoins with massive potential to explode when $BTC rallies again. If Michael Saylor’s predictions hold true, that surge could be just around the corner. In keeping with all things $BTC, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) brings an exciting proposal to the crypto table. A Bitcoin Layer-2 (L2) platform. The Bitcoin blockchain has a lot going for it, especially in terms of top-level security. It falls short, however, in terms of speed and high transaction fees, especially when compared to the likes of Solana. In short, Bitcoin lacks scalability. That’s where $HYPER steps up to the plate. This upcoming meme coin is set to power an innovative Bitcoin L2 ecosystem that will increase the speed and reduce fees. More importantly, it adds cross-chain compatibility. That means seamless access to the best meme coins, DeFi, and dApps. At the moment, Bitcoin Hyper is on presale. That means you can buy it for $0.0122. You can also stake your $HYPER for 360% APY. If you’re keen to discover more about this L2 and the meme coin behind it, take a look at our guide to buying $HYPER. It explains all you need to know. Keep in mind, though, that as a presale, the price of $HYPER will increase in stages, offering you the chance to secure tokens at a lower cost now. Additionally, the rewards APY is dynamic and will decrease over time, so the earlier you get in, the better the returns. Once $HYPER lists on DEXs after the presale, the price is expected to rise even further, so now is a prime opportunity to get involved before the price climbs. It’s not only institutions that are taking Bitcoin and other digital assets much more seriously these days. That’s what makes the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) one to watch with a very close eye. It’s the native token of Best Wallet, a non-custodial, no KYC, multi-chain, and multi-currency hot wallet that is gaining serious market traction. So much so that Best Wallet is on a mission to dominate 40% of the global crypto wallet market by the end of next year. And it’s using $BEST to help it achieve that target. Holding $BEST means additional benefits and features of what is already a leading crypto wallet. That includes being able to buy the best presale crypto directly from the mobile wallet (a market first, by the way); lower transaction fees; and higher staking rewards. $BEST is also on presale. Buy yours today for $0.025305 and stake it for 99% before the upcoming price increase. Our How To Buy $BEST guide explains how to do just that. The America Party Token ($AP) is another newcomer to the crypto scene. It was launched mere days after Elon Musk announced he intends to create a new political party. However, unlike $HYPER and $BEST, which are both on presale, $AP is already listed on DEXs. That said, $AP does stand to ride on Musk’s coattails. And to sweeten the deal, when Musk mentions a cryptocurrency, meme coins in particular, that token often explodes. And recently, Musk was asked by a follower whether his America Party will embrace Bitcoin. His response was definitive: “Fiat is useless, so yes.” Another boost for crypto. Right now, $AP costs $0.01830 – up 239.38% since it launched on July 7. Get yours today through UniSwap or MEXC. As Saylor put it, “Bitcoin is moving higher.” And while the market can be unpredictable at best, $BTC’s latest rally to $112K is a definitive indicator that the institutional adoption of digital assets is positively impacting, and with signs of slowing. That means newer cryptos like $HYPER, $BEST, and $AP also have the potential to pump if current conditions continue. And the best part of investing in new tokens is getting in at an early-bird price. That said, nothing is guaranteed, and we’re not financial advisers. Be sure to always DYOR research before making any investment.

UK Switch 2 stock: Mario Kart World Bundle £429.99 at Amazon This is a superb, record-low price on the Xbox variants of the GameBuds in the US, and it's the time to commit if you've been eyeing them up.

UK price: was £149.99 now £119.89 at Amazon I loved Assassin's Creed Shadows when it came out and have platinumed it since. This is a bargain considering the open-world-hours value it offers too. UK price: was £56.99 now £39.99 at Amazon Perfect for anyone looking to get a headset for, well, any platform whatsoever, as this Xbox variant works on any machine. Superb quality, and superb value for money.

It's perfect for cloud gaming via Amazon's Luna service, and even comes bundled with a free month of Luna+ if you're a new subscriber. Indeed, if you are looking to embrace streaming as your main form of gaming, then this bundle which gets you everything you need to be an Xbox console gamer without the console is a great offering. The PlayStation-focused variant of the Nova 5 is a brilliant headset for PS5 users, and with more than a third off its price this Prime Day, it is excellent value for money. UK price: was £129.99 now £89.99 at Amazon In our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review, we called this RPG "incredibly immersive" with "a staggering level of freedom" within its "beautiful and authentic environments". The combat is excellent too, and we said it was "challenging but well-balanced". Best UK price: was £49.99 now £36.99 at Currys This is a lowest-ever price for the Sony Inzone H3, and honestly, an incredible deal for a headset from the maker of the PS5 itself. This model is wired, but it offers fantastic audio quality and a capable microphone. UK price: was £89 now £45 at Amazon Not only does the 2TB Samsung 990 Pro SSD come with a fantastic $60 discount, but it also offers all of the same awesome strengths as the rest of the range. Coupled with the aforementioned heat sink, the drives all offer blisteringly fast read / write speeds of 7450MB/s / 6900MB/s. Not at all bad for less than $150. UK price: £173.85 at ebuyer Just a few bucks shy of half price, this is an essential PS5 accessory if you've grown tired of that DualSense low battery warning. It can be hooked up to your console or PC via USB-C, and you simply place your controller in the slot on top of the unit to begin charging. Simple. UK price: was £24.99 now £19.99 at Amazon My favorite gaming headset ever made, this is a great price for the Nova Pro Wireless, and in its chic white colorway. UK price : was £329.99 now £232.99 at Amazon Sign up for an invitation to buyWhile not on sale at this very moment, this is a noteworthy move by Amazon which up until now has seen very little in the way of stock or Switch 2 movement. UK: Bundles available at Very Even though it'll arrive a little after the Switch 2's launch, the next 3D Donkey Kong game is going to be a brilliant one to play as one of the first bona fide Switch 2 games. UK price: £64.95 at Amazon The mClassic is one of the best upscalers for Switch and retro consoles. It's able to take lower resolution images and bump them up to 1080p or 1440p, allowing for a much cleaner and sharper image overall. If you have a HDMI adapter for older consoles, the device has a dedicated 4:3 retro mode, too. UK price: was £99.99 now £69.88 at Amazon Whether you're into Fortnite or not, I still recommend checking out the Nitro Deck. This superb Switch accessory is a handheld player's best friend, offering improved controls and a handy shell for keeping the display safe from harm while you're out and about. UK price: was £59.99 now £49.99 at Amazon This special edition Genshin Impact power bank by Ugreen features a 20,000 mAh battery and 100W fast charging, quickly charging everything from phones to portable consoles and laptops.

UK price: £74.99 at Amazon This is a new lowest-ever price for the Scuf Valor Pro, a wired Xbox controller that boasts Hall effect thumbsticks, remappable rear inputs, and in-built audio controls. This is probably my favorite Xbox controller, personally. Its modular design is brilliant and enables me to use it in a symmetrical layout, while the overall quality here is superb. An updated version of the eswap X Pro, this isn't a record low but still a tidy saving on a premium wired gaming controller for Xbox and PC. UK price: £169.39 at Amazon (Elden Ring edition) Maybe the best Xbox-specific gaming headset deal going right now, this the deal to go for if you're after some audio givers for team green's console. UK price: was £129.99 now £89.99 at Amazon If the 2TB card that I've highlighted above is a bit much, then the 1TB alternative might be a better fit - and it's also on offer this Prime Day. UK price: £126.99 at Argos This complete recreation of the original Xbox controller - lovingly nicknamed the Duke for its chunky profile - is compatible with Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and PC.

UK price: £99.99 at Tesco (yes, really) Another near-peerless Xbox audio deal, these earbuds are designed for Microsoft's console - that will work with everything else are at an all-time record-low price for Prime Day. UK price: was £159.99 now £118.74 at Amazon Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the very best Prime Day gaming deals that you can spend your money on right now. We're just over the halfway point of the four-day Prime Day extravaganza, but there's plenty to shout about and dig into so let's do exactly that! I'm going to get the ball rolling with some of my absolute top picks for the best Prime Day gaming deals I've spotted. These are going to be on some of my favorite games that I've played and bits of gear that I've tested - a theme of our overall approach here as my colleagues will be doing the same. We will absolutely still be highlighting discounts and deals more broadly though - there's so much good stuff out there, after all! The first deal I want to highlight is on one of my most favorite bits of gaming gear of the past couple of years. Simply put, the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds are the best gaming earbuds money can buy in my view, and now that they've reached historic low prices as part of the Amazon Prime Day gaming deals, there's literally never been a better time to pick them up. No matter your platform, if you're after some buds, these are the ones to go for. US – SteelSeries Arctis Gamebuds (Black; Xbox): was $199.99 now £147.99 at Amazon UK – SteelSeries Arctis Gamebuds (Black; Xbox): was £159.99 now £118.74 at Amazon However, if you prefer a headset, then let me direct you to the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X which is currently enjoying brillianlty low prices on both sides of the Atlantic. This is one of the best value, and best overall packages of a headset that I can remember testing, and given the superb audio quiality and limitless compatibiltiy of the Nova 5X, this is a no brainer for anyone looking for a headset this Prime Day.US - SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X: was $149.99 now $99.74 at Amazon UK – SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X: was £129.99 now £89.99 at Amazon To take a small diversion from my own personal gaming picks, this one is an absolute belter if you're on Nintendo Switch - especially in the face of Switch 2 stock being hard to find. If you've ever wanted your OG Switch to perform and look a bit better on the big screen, then this is the device you should invest in: the mClassic upscaler. It'll take your low resolution images and bump them up while simultaneously polishing them right up. Simple but very effective. US – Marseille mClassic: was $99.99 now $74.99 at Amazon UK – Marseille mClassic: was £99.99 now £69.88 at Amazon Speaking of adding things to existing setups that make things better, this is something I've recently added to my PS5 Pro setup and have been seriously impressed by: the Creative Sound BlasterX G6 USB sound card. Traditionally, I've always been a wireless-only kind of guy for my setup, but since testing this out and going back to a wired headset for a bit with it, I'm not sure if I can game any other way now. The sound difference and quality the G6 has given me on PS5 is exquisite and has made the audio of Death Stranding something almost otherworldly. What's more, it's now down to a record low price in the UK and a heavily discounted price in the US. Nice. US – Creative Sound BlasterX G6: was $179.99 now $139.99 at Amazon UK – Creative Sound BlasterX G6: was £129.99 now £81.59 at Amazon There's never a bad time to get another controller into your setup as a spare or just to grow or fill out your collection stylishly. As a result, the discounts this Prime Day on Xbox Wireless Controllers are both easy to recommend and worth investing in if you're on the hunt for a new pad. US – Xbox Wireless Controller (Black): was $64.99 now $47.49 at Amazon UK – Xbox Wireless Controller (Black): was £59.99 now £49.99 at Amazon Right, I'm actually stepping away from our live coverage for a bit now leaving you in the capable hands of my gamer colleague Dash. I will be here again tomorrow though, so until then, happy deal hunting! Hello gamers! Dash here to take things over on the live coverage front. I've been trawling the sale for the last few days, so have plenty of bargains to share with you. Sit back, relax, and get ready for some deals. I'm going to start off strong with a personal pick... The Scuf Valor Pro is an excellent controller from a seriously well-regarded brand. It boasts a number of features that make it a perfect fit for Call of Duty games, including adjustable triggers, remappable rear inputs, and in-built audio controls. This is a wired-only model, which might be a shame for some, but comes in at a more affordable price than other Scuf products. At the moment, it's even been discounted down to lowest-ever rate for Prime Day. US - Scuf Valor Pro: was $109.99 now $85.49 at Amazon The Razer Blackshark V2 X is a fantastic gaming headset that comes personally recommended by our Hardware Editor Rhys Wood. It's the headset that he uses every day, as it offers the perfect balance of audio quality, microphone performance, attractive design, and affordability. Right now it's just a few bucks off its lowest-ever price and is a fantastic pick if you're looking for a capable gaming audio device that isn't going to completely empty your wallet - leaving you with some left over cash to spend on even more Prime Day gaming deals! US - Razer BlackShark V2 X: was $59.99 now $36.08 at Amazon UK - Razer BlackShark V2 X: was £41.99 now £32.99 at Amazon Another wired Xbox controller deal here with the Thrustmaster Heart. This unique-looking controller is named after its H.E.A.R.T. anti-drift thumbsticks, which incorporates Hall effect technology for enhanced durability and precision. On top of this, it features two remappable rear buttons, mechanical face buttons, and even a customizable RGB lighting strip right down the middle of the pad. It's currently the lowest-ever price it's been in the UK with a £28.25 discount for Prime Day! UK - Thrustmaster Heart Controller: was £89.99 now £61.74 at Amazon Time for one of my personal Prime Day favorites! Every year we see massive discounts on the fantastic Backbone One mobile controller and the ongoing sale is no exception. If you're after a versatile mobile gamepad, then I would highly recommend it. It's a fantastic all-rounder and the perfect companion if you're planning some travel and need something to keep you entertained in a pinch. Right now the best price is on the PlayStation Edition, which comes in an attractive white colorway and has DualSense Wireless Controller themed buttons. US - Backbone One, Playstation Edition: was $99.99 now $69.99 at Amazon UK - Backbone One, Playstation Edition: was £60 now £40 at Amazon The critically acclaimed Split Fiction has received a massive lowest-ever Prime Day discount and should be in your basket! The co-op action-adventure game came out back in March, so a deal this generous is a real surprise. It received the full five out of five stars from us here at TechRadar Gaming, which is very rare indeed. We loved its innovative mechanics and the seemingly endless variety of different playstyles crammed into the game. It's also visually stunning, pulling off both sci-fi and fantasy settings with impressive fidelity. Just bear in mind that this is a co-op only game before you buy - you can't play it solo in any capacity. Luckily, each copy comes with a handy 'Friend's Pass', which allows you to play with a buddy who doesn't own it at no additional cost US - Split Fiction (PS5): was $49.99 now $35 at Amazon UK - Split Fiction (PS5): was £44.99 now £30.99 at Amazon Okay, this is a bit of a weird one but might be worth checking out if you're using Prime Day as a chance to stock on gifts. Gaming brand HyperX makes a mini headset designed specifically for kids, and it's currently on sale for its lowest-ever price. I had the chance to try it out at Gamescom last year and, while it absolutely didn't fit on my massive gamer head I can attest to its durability. The headset is seriously flexible and didn't so much as creak when I tried my hardest to snap it into pieces in front of the horrified PR representative. Its hard-wearing materials aside, the headset is compatible with all major platforms thanks to the 3.5mm headphone jack and comes in a range of attractive colorways. US - HyperX Cloud Mini Kids: was $29.99 now $19.99 at Amazon Hi there! Josh here, now taking over the live blogging to give Dash a quick break. I've been working behind the scenes all Prime Day writing up deals so I'll be bringing you some of my favorite options from across the sales over the coming hour. So without any further ado... Another bargain PS5 game now and one that's at its lowest price ever in the UK – and not far off in the US. A spiritual successor to the Zoo Tycoon series, Planet Zoo puts you in charge of your own menagerie, allowing you to handcraft your own exquisite animal exhibits filled with everything from Aldabra giant tortoises to western lowland gorillas. Confession time. I'm an enormous PlanZoo addict: I've racked up a truly disgusting 1,200 hours in the game and have no intention of stopping any time soon. Part of what makes the game worth investing your money – and an enormous amount of time – in its the creative freedom it gives you. If you love being able to obsess over details to create your dream zoo, it's a really rewarding experience. It's already offers a huge amount of playtime for a pretty modest spend. And with this deal, that value gets even harder to ignore. US - Planet Zoo (PS5): was $49.99 now $34.99 at Amazon UK - Planet Zoo (PS5): was £39.99 now £19.94 at Amazon If, like me, you were an early Nintendo Switch adopter, you might find your console is getting a little long in the tooth. But if you''re not ready to upgrade to the Switch 2 just yet, you're in luck: one of the best accessories released for the Switch Gen 1 is now available at its lowest ever price. The Nitro Deck is the perfect way to give your handheld a bit of an update. Slot your screen inside it and it'll give you more ergonomic grip and protect your Switch from knocks. But its biggest benefit is it will banish that annoying stick drift with its Hall effect thumbsticks – something I've experienced more times than I'd like the recall. As a gamer of a certain age, I have very fond memories of my GameCube so I particularly love the purple Nitro Deck on offer here, although both the gray and mint colorways are also on offer. US - CRKD Nitro Deck: was $79.99 now $47.99 at Amazon UK - CRKD Nitro Deck: was £59.99 now £47.49 at Amazon Hey everyone! Dash again, back to take over. I'm currently scanning the web for the latest gaming deals, so bear with me for a few moments as I hand-pick the very best ones to share... Right now you can grab the Atari 7800+ at an absolutely incredible 54% off - taking it down to just under $60 at Amazon. For that price you get a fully-featured retro-style games console, plus a controller and an original game cartridge for Bentley Bear's Crystal Quest. On top of this, the console supports original Atari 2600 or 7800 game cartridges, so it could be perfect if you want to grow your own retro collection or have some old games lying around. US - Atari 7800+: was $129.99 now $59.99 at Amazon If you're still using your Nintendo Switch and want to get a little bit Peely with it, then accessory maker PowerA has you covered. This neon yellow carrying case is based on the iconic Fortnite character and even comes with a code for an in-game item. It fits the original Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch OLED, and Nintendo Switch Lite, with built-in storage space for games, small accessories, and even a little padded stand. The current offer is also the lowest price that this model has ever been, though only a few cents. US - PowerA Protection Case for Nintendo Switch (Fortnite Peely): was $22.99 now $12.29 at Amazon We consider the Meta Quest 3S to be one of the very best VR headsets on the market, scoring five stars in our review, where we called it "the only VR headset you need" whether you're completely new to VR or an experienced headset owner. It strikes the perfect balance between performance, practicality, and price. Over Amazon Prime Day, that price tag has got even more tempting, however, with a record discount available right now. In you've been waiting for the chance to dive into the world of VR gaming, you shouldn't pass on this. US - Meta Quest 3S: was $299.99 now $249 at Amazon UK - Meta Quest 3S: was £289 now £237.99 at Amazon Getting into the world doesn't have to be expensive - just look at this affordable microphone from HyperX. The HyperX SoloCast is currently on sale for a lowest-ever price in the UK, with a whopping 30% off. It's rare to see items from trusted brands like this at such low prices. The main reasons to pick the SoloCast is its ease-of-use: this is a simple, plug-and-play microphone that delivers impressive sound right out of the box. The tap-to-mute sensor and adjustable stand are also great inclusions at the price range and make recording or even just chatting with friends a breeze. UK - HyperX SoloCast: was £36.89 now £25.64 at Amazon I've spotted another budget-friendly headset in the Prime Day sales, this time the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1 - which is down to a new lowest-ever price! Compatible with PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, it offers plenty of adjustability and a retractable noise-cancelling microphone. Although nothing special the sound is decent for the price. Where this headset really wins, however, is in its comfortable ski-band head strap design and plush ear cushions. UK - SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1: was £59.99 now £31.34 at Amazon This is a US deal that I'm really jealous of. The Special Edition version of the superb Horizon Forbidden West has dropped to its lowest-ever price and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in trying the popular PlayStation series. Set in a futuristic open-world in which you have to survive against vicious, animal-like machines, it's ideal if you're craving a big, meaty experience that will keep you occupied for weeks. Although this is a sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn, no knowledge of that prior game is required to enjoy it. The Special Edition also nets you a SteelBook, mini art book, and a digital soundtrack to enjoy. US - Horizon Forbidden West Special Edition: was $79.99 now $39.99 at Amazon Now this is a bit of a shocker: the PlayStation Portal has received a 10% discount in the UK. That might not sound like much, but it takes it down to a new lowest-ever price and is by far the best PS Portal deal that I've seen yet. The streaming handheld is a popular choice for PS5 owners, letting you play games straight from your console via the internet. It's not quite a PSP replacement, but it can come in clutch when you need to free up the TV for someone else. Its design is excellent too, effectively offering two sides of a DualSense Wireless Controller sandwiched around a screen with all the expected features like rumble, adaptive triggers, and more. Best of all, you don't even need to be a Prime member for this offer! UK - PlayStation Portal: was £199.99 now £179 at Amazon Don't sleep on this incredible Razer Kishi Ultra discount. In my book it's by far the best mobile controller on the market, as long as you don't mind splashing out a bit. It offers an unbeatable level of comfort thanks to its full-size controller grips and offers no shortage of premium features. You get USB-C passthrough charging, full-size thumbsticks, Hall effect triggers, mechanical buttons and a clicky D-pad, and even some customizable RGB lighting strips. Where this mobile controller really leaves the competition in the dust though is its software, which is packed with useful additions including the ability to mimic on-screen commands with buttons to enable compatibility in titles that don't natively support a controller. It's an absolute game-changer for things like League of Legends Wild Rift. US - Razer Kishi Ultra: was $149.99 now $99.99 at Amazon The well-received Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has crashed down to a record low price for Prime Day. Right now the Xbox version can be yours for a whopping $36.59 off - beating the previous record low by a considerable margin. This post-apocalyptic survival adventure won't be for everyone, but fans of atmospheric and haunting experiences will absolutely love it. It features intense, realistic survival mechanics and a grounded world that's brought to life by modern high-end graphics. US - Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl: was $59.99 now $23.40 at Amazon Interested in a handheld PC? Then you should take a look at this ASUS Rog Ally bargain. The powerful system is currently hovering just 99p above its lowest-ever price at Amazon in the UK, which is an absolutely mega saving. Thanks to AMD's powerful Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip, you'll be able to enjoy a wide range of triple-A games at a 1920x1080 resolution on the crisp 7-inch 120Hz refresh rate screen. In our testing, it achieved an impressive 60 fps in Cyberpunk 2077 after some graphical tweaking, with even better performance for those willing to make use of frame generation. UK - ASUS ROG Ally: was £518.42 now £399.99 at Amazon It just hit midnight here in the UK, which means that we are now officially on our final day of the latest Prime Day sale. If you need a quick recap, the event is running from July 8 to the end of July 11. This means that now is a good time to start pressing the purchase button if you've been stocking your basket, as there's no word on how long any deals could stick around once Prime Day comes to an end. We're also coming up to the final stretch of savings in the US, with less than 34 hours to go. I'm about to head off for the day, but not before I draw your attention to one of the very, very best deals that I've seen so far. The Sony Inzone H3 is a great headset from the PlayStation maker, offering easy plug-and-play compatibility and support for spatial sound. It performs well too, with fantastic audio quality and a flip-to-mute microphone that's ideal for chatting with friends. It's a decent deal at its regular $99.99 price, but this limited time offer knocks over 52% off! That takes it down to under $50, where it absolutely decimates the competition. If you're planning to buy a headset over Prime Day and don't want to spend a lot, then make sure that it's this one. US - Sony Inzone H3: was $99.99 now $48 at Amazon Good morning and welcome to the last day of the Amazon Prime Day gaming deals of 2025. Today marks the last chance to grab something extra for your setup, add a cool game to your backlog on the cheap, or go for that big upgrade you've been considering. We're still seeing some belting discounts across all platforms and devices so use all those links above and we'll continue posting some awesome deals in our live coverage. Starting off with a bang for our UK readers, Amazon has come in clutch and is offering a bona fide 10% discount on the excellent PlayStation Portal handheld device. Deals and discounts have been incredibly hard to come by on the remote play PS5 streaming device, so this is absolutely worth shouting about. I love the Portal too, and it really has given me an extra way to tackle my backlog from the comfort of the sofa, or while away. UK - PlayStation Portal: was £199.99 now £179 at Amazon All the deals at the top of this page are still worth investigating, too, by the way, so definitely get involved with those links to see if you can find your Prime Day gaming deal that will boost your summer.

Title: The Persecution of Francesca Albanese. Chris Hedges
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/persecution-francesca-albanese-chris-hedges/5894678
Time Published: 2025-07-10T14:06:33Z
Full Content:
When the history of the genocide in Gaza is written, one of the most courageous and outspoken champions for justice and the adherence to international law will be Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur, who today the Trump administration is sanctioning. Her office is tasked with monitoring and reporting on human rights violations that Israel commits against Palestinians. Albanese, who regularly receives death threats and endures well-orchestrated smear campaigns directed by Israel and its allies, valiantly seeks to hold those who support and sustain the genocide accountable. She lambasts what she calls “the moral and political corruption of the world” that allows the genocide to continue. Her office has issued detailed reports documenting war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank, one of which, called “Genocide as colonial erasure,” I have reprinted as an appendix in my latest book, “A Genocide Foretold.” She has informed private organizations that they are “criminally liable” for assisting Israel in carrying out the genocide in Gaza. She announced that if true, as has been reported, that the former British prime minister David Cameron threatened to defund and withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC) after it issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, which Cameron and the other former British prime minister Rishi Sunak could be charged with a criminal offense for, under the Rome Statue. The Rome Statue criminalizes those who seek to prevent war crimes from being prosecuted. She has called on top European Union (EU) officials to face charges of complicity of war crimes over their support for the genocide, saying that their actions cannot be met with impunity. She was a champion of the Madleen flotilla that sought to break the blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian aid, writing that the boat which was intercepted by Israel, was carrying not only supplies, but a message of humanity. You can see the interview I did with Albanese here or watch below. Her latest report lists 48 corporations and institutions, including Palantir Technologies Inc., Lockheed Martin, Alphabet Inc. (Google), Amazon, International Business Machine Corporation (IBM), Caterpillar Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), along with banks and financial firms such as BlackRock, insurers, real estate firms and charities, which in violation of international law, are making billions from the occupation and the genocide of Palestinians. You can read my article on Albanese’s most recent report here. Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned her support for the ICC, four of whose judges have been sanctioned by the U.S. for issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant last year. He criticized Albanese for her efforts to prosecute American or Israeli nationals who sustain the genocide, saying she is unfit for service as a special rapporteur. Rubio also accused Albanese of having “spewed unabashed antisemitism, expressed support for terrorism, and open contempt for the United States, Israel, and the West.” The sanctions will most likely prevent Albanese from travelling to the U.S. and will freeze any assets she may have in the country. The attack against Albanese presages a world without rules, one where rogue states, such as the U.S. and Israel, are permitted to carry out war crimes and genocide without any accountability or restraint. It exposes the subterfuges we use to fool ourselves and attempt to fool others. It reveals our hypocrisy, cruelty and racism. No one, from now on, will take seriously our stated commitments to democracy, freedom of expression, the rule of law or human rights. And who can blame them? We speak exclusively in the language of force, the language of brutes, the language of mass slaughter, the language of genocide. “The acts of killing, the mass killing, the infliction of psychological and physical torture, the devastation, the creation of conditions of life that would not allow the people in Gaza to live, from the destruction of hospitals, the mass forced displacement and the mass homelessness, while people were being bombed daily, and the starvation — how can we read these acts in isolation?” Albanese asked in an interview I did with her when we discussed her report, “Genocide as colonial erasure.” The militarized drones, helicopter gunships, walls and barriers, checkpoints, coils of concertina wire, watchtowers, detention centers, deportations, brutality and torture, denial of entry visas, apartheidesque existence that comes with being undocumented, loss of individual rights and electronic surveillance, are as familiar to desperate migrants along the Mexican border, or attempting to enter Europe, as they are to Palestinians. This is what awaits those who Frantz Fanon calls “the wretched of the earth.” Those that defend the oppressed, such as Albanese, will be treated like the oppressed. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: The S&P is soaring, but fewer companies are setting record highs. Why that could be a red flag for the market

Alicia Adamczyk is a New York City-based senior writer at Fortune, covering personal finance, investing, and retirement. The S&P 500 has been setting record highs in recent days, a dramatic turn from the market selloff back in April. But analysts are warning fortunes could change if overall market participation in the rally holds at the current rate. The new heights the S&P is reaching are being undermined by narrow company participation in those highs, according to a July 5 report from Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at wealth and investment management firm Oppenheimer & Co., and first reported by Bloomberg. Referred to as market breadth, analysts often try to see how many companies in a specific index or sector are participating in a rally to gauge how healthy it really is. That is important to track, says Wald, because narrow participation can mask underlying weakness in the market: Since 1972, the S&P 500 has posted below-average returns over the next one-, three-, six-, and 12-month periods when its all-time high coincides with fewer than 100 companies on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) also hitting new highs, the analysis finds. At the last market high, 88 companies on the NYSE also hit a high. Indeed, big tech companies have been the drivers behind the recent market heights: Just five stocks—Amazon (AMZN), Broadcom (AVGO), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA)—are contributing over half of the S&P 500’s total return, according to an analysis from Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial. It’s always a concern when just a few companies are responsible for most of the gains—because that means those gains could easily turn into losses depending on the strength of just a handful of companies. That’s what happened in mid-2023, when a Magnificent Seven–driven rally faded. And while the S&P 500 was less than 1% away from a new high at Wednesday’s close, the median S&P 500 stock was trading about 12% below a 52-week high, Turnquist finds. “Breadth is a little underwhelming,” he writes. “For context, over the last decade, the gap between the index and the median stock’s 52-week highs has averaged around 5%.” The good news, according to analysts, is that market breadth has been improving in recent weeks. The share of stocks in the S&P 500 above their 200-day moving average is 61%, just below the 10-year average of 62%, says Chris Haverland, global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute (WFII). Another positive sign for the market: All S&P 500 sectors have participated in the rally. Haverland says he expects to see more improvement in broader participation as investors get greater clarity on fiscal and trade policies. “Given the strong rally, however, we wouldn’t be surprised to see some consolidation in the coming months as the economy and earnings begin to digest the evolving trade policy,” Haverland says. “So, it may be a good time to rebalance portfolios.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: If I ran X
URL: https://werd.io/if-i-ran-x/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T13:54:17Z
Full Content:
How to transform the internet's most toxic platform into essential infrastructure. “After two incredible years,” Linda Yaccarino tweeted, “I’ve decided to step down as CEO of 𝕏.” It was the day after the company’s AI chatbot, Grok, began calling itself MechaHitler and started spewing antisemitic slurs and advocating for Adolf Hitler in public until the company eventually had to remove them. Many of the users still posting to X greeted the antisemitism warmly; some tweeted, “finally”. No new CEO has been named. I’ve previously written about what I’d do if I ran Bluesky product, Mastodon, my own platform, and a fund supporting the open social web. I’d intended to stop the series there. But as there’s an opening: let’s imagine I was handed the reins to the most toxic mainstream social network. What would I do if I was the new CEO of X? I have some history with the people behind Twitter, the site that eventually became X. I consider multiple people who were there at the site’s inception, as well as many people who worked there in its later years, to be friends; Biz Stone sat on my first startup’s advisory board; I worked for Ev Williams at Medium for a little while. I’ve heard various pieces of founding stories from each of them. And I really loved using Twitter. Long before Elon Musk bought it, I was an addicted user who posted many times a day. It opened up communities for me: I attended Twestivals (and hosted one), saw Ben Walker play his Twitter Song live, took part in countless hashtag games and still own a tote bag I won from the literary magazine Granta for writing a tweet-length horror story. Every time I went to an industry event or a conference, I’d be in the Twitter backchannel, making and reading observations, and building new connections. And then, one day, Elon Musk walked into the building carrying a kitchen sink and began to refashion it around his need to amass power and influence to bring about his edgelord, pronatalist, Hitler-saluting view of the world. The name changed to X, Musk’s original name for PayPal, a company whose board voted to fire him as CEO due to mismanagement. Musk fired 80% of the staff, cratered the morale of the people who remained, reinstated Nazi accounts, hate speech surged — and the rest is history. I’ve been given the reins. I’m CEO now. Can it be saved? Throughout this tumult, X’s active user numbers have remained remarkably steady. 2024’s 335.7M monthly active users represented a 9% drop from 2022, the year Musk acquired Twitter. TechCrunch recently reported that its web views remain vastly higher than new competitors like Threads and Bluesky. Famously, many brands and journalists have been reticent to leave the site, despite its near-constant onslaught of white supremacy and hate speech. In other words: the traffic is there. These users may be a mix of bots, literal Nazis, and people who don’t mind posting on a site that is heavily used by literal Nazis, but there are hundreds of millions of them. So that’s something. On the other hand, its revenue tanked following the acquisition, with some reports showing a drop as big as 66%. More recently, it saw 17.5% growth between 2024 and 2025, but it needs to claw back a lot of ground if it wants to return to its 2021 revenue peak — and even then, it posted a loss for most of the decade that preceded it. In short: its online culture is toxic, its finances are decimated, and morale at the company is through the floor. But there is a great deal of remaining traffic, and many stalwarts have refused to give up followings they spent over a decade building. If we want to turn it around, the only place it’s possible to start is the culture of the company itself. Everything else flows from there. First, let’s address the ketamine in the room: there is no possible cultural turnaround at X while Elon Musk owns the site or has a significant stake. It must be acquired from him. That may seem far-fetched, but much of his wealth is stored in Tesla stock; in a world where his political machinations tank the price of his cash cow, he may need liquidity through other means. X’s valuation had already declined by 80%; his own xAI acquired it at a relative discount. As X’s culture continues to degrade, it may prove to be a drag on the valuation of his AI startup. The benefits of offloading it, in other words, may begin to outweigh the benefits to keeping it. A coalition of hands-on investors would be needed to perform this acquisition, but consider the upside: a de-Nazified Twitter would be worth considerably more than its current incarnation. Musk had previously taken it private; the revived company could once again be floated on the stock market. The potential gains would be significant. A newly-independent X would then be ripe for change. Executives and managers who were loyal to Musk would need to be removed. It’s not a given that other employees were fully on board with his “extremely hardcore”, hard-right ideology: some may have needed to remain to maintain their visas or to ensure a paycheck in a tough hiring environment. Internally, diversity policies and mandatory inclusion training would return. Protections for work-life balance would return, and remote work would once again be allowed, with a staged roll-out. Work would be undertaken to establish an internal culture of empathy, which is a hard requirement for building non-toxic communities; experts like Carole Robin and Vernā Myers would be heavily drawn on for ongoing manager training and culture guidance, and experts like Dr Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru would be drawn on to help the company be mindful the implications of ongoing work. This is the work of years, but the process would begin immediately. To be clear, it’s not that employees would need to be left-wing. This isn’t an inquisition, and a company culture that only allows one political alignment is more harmful than good. But basic human decency would once again be a value: hate speech and bigotry would be explicitly disallowed, and it would be made obvious that the aim of Twitter’s platform is to create a community where voices from a diversity of communities should feel safe to post, which starts with internal cultural expectations. Nazi accounts would need to be banned again, swiftly, with their posts preserved internally in a vault in a de facto legal hold. The messages would be made available as a dataset to organizations that research and investigate hate groups, although users would have the ability to have their content removed in accordance with relevant privacy legislation for their jurisdiction. Significant investments would be made into non-profits and on-the-ground organizations that support the vulnerable communities harmed by the hate speech, doxxing, and other activities previously enabled on X. A commitment would be made for ongoing support: it couldn’t be a one-and-done gesture. A permanent, inclusive trust and safety council would be established, modeled after the Supreme Court, with real, encoded power to affect company policies around content and moderation. This council and its permanence would be defined in the articles of association of the new company; it would be almost impossible to remove them. Its members would be guaranteed a salary (but could not own stock) and required to both adjudicate on content moderation issues and intervene during strategic lapses. The number of members of the council would increase based on active users but could never decrease. Employees who objected to these measures would be free to take a buyout. Some would likely just quit. Meanwhile, the company would begin to aggressively hire across the board, including but not limited to engineering, product, research, design, partnerships, communications, and trust and safety. Public statements and heavy PR would signal the internal cultural changes in order to attract new applicants. The name and brand would be symbolically restored to Twitter, indicating a clean break from the Musk years. It’s a trustworthy brand, and the change back would likely turn heads. But it would be a mistake to simply return the company to its old self. The new Twitter needs to be something else entirely. It’s now clear that Musk’s acquisition was about amassing power, not providing value. As Dan Primack wrote in Axios last year: While this might seem like a selling point to a would-be autocrat, it serves as a weakness to Twitter as a business. Not only does this property make it vulnerable to takeovers from terrible people, but it elevates the company’s business decisions to a level where a mistake could significantly impact democracy or even public safety around the world. (This is also the lesson Meta failed to learn in Myanmar.) In turn, this could subject the company to greater regulatory scrutiny and oversight. It may seem like value at first sight, but it’s actually a business risk. So how can the new Twitter be incredibly valuable but also safer from regulatory oversight? The core value of Twitter is not its social network as such. That’s always been a means to an end. The vast majority of content on the site has historically been created by just 10% of users, but people don’t log in to post: they want to see what other people are saying. The point of Twitter is to find out what’s going on right now and get an insight into the conversation around it. My new Twitter would retain the social network but expand upon the idea that people want to know what’s happening right now. The feed would expand to not just include Twitter’s own conversations, but every public conversation across the social web. Search, trending topics, and live dashboards would represent the entire addressable real-time web, using open standards and protocols like AT Protocol, ActivityPub, and RSS. Twitter would become the way to find out what’s happening everywhere. Some social networks — like Facebook — would not be available via this feed. The addressable social web would consist of sites that embrace open protocols (best), or otherwise make a content deal directly with Twitter (less good). However, a Twitter that aims to provide the pulse of the internet and not necessarily a social network in itself is less of a competitor to closed networks; in fact, the tools may provide new engagement and users for them. The aim would be, over time, to make not being represented on the feed more of a business liability for closed social networking platforms than being included. Twitter would provide libraries, ecosystem support, and even funding for open social web protocols: its value increases as the the social web pie gets bigger. Monetization would be three-prong. Advertising would remain on public feeds, and a renewed focus on trust and safety would improve brand safety, bringing advertising prices back up. Twitter Blue premium profiles on the social network would remain. But most differently, enterprise tools for tracking public sentiment and yielding unique insights from the global conversation would be made available for corporations, media companies, and governments. These tools would also be made available to public research institutions, with some restrictions, for free. Using open protocols should help reduce regulatory risk. In this world, trust and safety is as much about de-listing external content as it is about policing the in-house social network. Aggregating across the entire social web is an enormous infrastructure task that requires real resources and expertise to carry out; the compliance demands across global jurisdictions are complex but fully within Twitter’s wheelhouse. The moat for the business is, in part, the combination of the difficulty of building the tools and their ease of use for end users. In-house expertise would create proprietary machine learning algorithms for sentiment and insight analysis, and integrations with third-party tools like CRMs and analytics platforms could embed the platform in existing enterprise ecosystems. It’s a very similar model to how Google originally became the dominant search engine: simplicity of use combined with the sophistication of its internal technology, all layered over the open web. It’s not even particularly unprecedented: Blaine Cook, then CTO of Twitter, was fired for demonstrating interoperability with Jaiku, another social network. For this new Twitter, interoperability would be core to its value. This transformation wouldn’t happen overnight. A still-aggressive but more realistic timeline might look like: Once established, the new Twitter would set the tone for the social web itself. By implication, it wouldn’t just be the way that conversations were discovered; people would find platforms this way, too. By not hyper-focusing on its own social network, it has the potential to become a much bigger and more valuable company: one that people use to unlock the entire online social conversation. By using open protocols, the company ensures the whole internet isn’t locked into its services, but by caring for trust and safety, design, and the quality of its feeds, it provides best-in-class options for people to choose. And it fosters a bigger, more interesting social web in the process. Does X or Twitter actually need to be saved? Absolutely not. There are plenty of new social networks that are more interesting, more fun to use, and show more promise. But there’s interesting potential here, both to remove a major source of toxicity on the internet, to diffuse a centralized source of power that can be abused by autocrats and oligarchs, and to create a way to elevate the entire social web. So that’s what I would do if I was CEO. "I do not have the time or emotional energy to screen out regular attacks by Large Language Models, with the knowledge that making the wrong decision costs a real human being their connection to a niche community." It's wild to me how many people are still engaging with X. As more people look to AI to learn about the world, the people who control how it's trained and how it responds will control our prevailing narratives. That's wildly dangerous. Forget San Francisco - I wish every single US city would do this. We're too car-dependent, too isolated, too unhealthy. (Honestly, European mixed-use development should be the model.)

Title: $21M Flows Into First US Solana ETF as Snorter Token Approaches $1.7M Milestone

Time Published: 2025-07-10T13:51:16Z
Full Content:
On July 8, the first US-listed spot Solana ETF – Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK) – recorded $21M in net inflows. Impressively, this pushed its total inflows to a hefty $41.2M in the first four days of launching. That single-day surge surpassed the $2.02M raised in the previous three trading sessions, effectively more than doubling the total inflows into the ETF. This is fantastic news for Solana. SSK’s ability to attract more users and capital significantly boosts the network’s visibility, liquidity, and overall credibility, positioning it for even greater success moving forward. As such, it’s highly bullish for Solana-based projects, like Snorter Token ($SNORT). Already, it has nearly raised $1.7M owing to being the backbone of a novel Telegram trading bot slated to launch in Q3 2025. Still, SSK’s footprint remains relatively small compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Despite doubling on July 8, the $41.2M in inflows represents just 0.5% of Solana’s market cap, far below Bitcoin’s 0.34% and Ethereum’s 0.3% penetration rates during their ETF launches. This gap primarily stems from SSK’s structure. Around 40% of its assets are tied to offshore Solana ETFs, whereas the rest is directly invested in $SOL. The SSK ETF’s impressive doubling highlights the growing early institutional interest in Solana. Should the SEC approve pending Solana ETF applications from Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Grayscale, it could trigger a fresh wave of capital into the network. As demand for the blockchain continues to rise, Solana-based projects like $SNORT are poised to benefit from the increased activity. Now could be the perfect time to explore these low-cap opportunities before they gain significant traction. $SNORT is the backbone of Snorter Bot, a crypto trading bot currently under development. Built directly on Telegram, it promises to make trading the best meme coins faster, safer, and easier. The bot will enable you to manage every part of your trading strategy from the fourth-largest messaging app worldwide: spot new tokens, snipe launches, place trades, and set stop losses. All will be achieved without compromising security. Snorter Bot will include real-time honeypot detection, rug pull alerts, and MEV protection. By doing so, it’ll shield you from malicious tokens and front-running attacks so that you don’t get caught off guard. Given that $2.2B in crypto was stolen last year, protective trading platforms like Snorter Bot have never been more necessary. It’ll initially go live on Solana to take advantage of the network’s low fees and high-speed transactions. After that, it’ll expand to EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Arbitrum. Beyond granting reduced fees, $SNORT also unlocks governance rights (anticipated around Q4 2025), additional premium features, and high-yield staking rewards, currently offering a 218% APY, which is not to be overlooked. In fact, there’s no better time to lock up some $SNORT. As more investors join the project, this percentage is likely to decrease, resulting in higher returns while also enhancing the ecosystem’s sustainability. It’s no wonder $SNORT has quickly raised $1.6M+ on presale in just a few months and shows no signs of slowing down. Solana’s recent ETF inflows are a clear sign of growing institutional interest, signaling a strong upward trend for the network. With the potential approval of more ETF applications by the SEC, even greater capital could flow into the blockchain. This bodes well for Solana-based projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT), which stand to benefit from the increased activity and investment. You can buy $SNORT on presale for as low as $0.0977 to get the most out of the Snorter ecosystem. Once listed on the best crypto exchanges, as promised around the end of the year, it’s projected to hit $0.94. Thereby, there’s no better time to join for potential 861% gains. This is not financial advice. Always do your own research (DYOR) and make informed decisions based on your own risk tolerance.

Title: The SEC Is Crashing the Digital Stocks Party
URL: https://gizmodo.com/the-sec-is-crashing-the-digital-stocks-party-2000627381
Time Published: 2025-07-10T13:20:28Z
Full Content:
For years, the promise of blockchain technology has captivated the financial world, hinting at a future where traditional assets are transformed into nimble, digital “tokens.” This vision, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce puts it, is “enchanting, but not magical.” SheÂ just sent a clear message to anyone hoping blockchain would free them from financial regulation: not so fast. Commissioner Peirce acknowledged the promise of tokenization, the process of turning real-world assets like stocks into blockchain-based digital tokens. But she warned that, no matter how futuristic it sounds, the same old rules still apply. âTokenized securities are still securities,â Peirce said in a statement. âThe same legal requirements apply to on- and off-chain versions of these instruments.â Her statement comes amid a frenzy of experimentation in tokenized finance. Firms like BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase, and Robinhood Markets are exploring how to tokenize everything from stocks and treasuries to real estate and private credit. The hype is real: blockchain-based markets promise 24/7 trading, faster settlement, better transparency, and a radically cheaper financial system. But the SEC is reminding everyone that innovation doesnât mean exemption. If youâre creating or selling tokenized securities, even if you’re just wrapping real assets in a digital shell, youâre still subject to decades-old laws governing how financial instruments are issued, traded, and disclosed. The goal of federal securities laws is to protect investors and ensure fair, orderly markets. The End of the Stock Market As We Know It Tokenization refers to the creation of digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership of real-world assets. These can be as simple as company shares or as complex as bundles of loans. Think of it as taking something traditionalâlike a Tesla stockâand putting it into a blockchain wallet so it can be traded like cryptocurrency. But not all tokens are created equal. Some are issued directly by the company (like a tokenized share of a public company), while others are created by third parties who hold the real assets and issue their own tokenized version. According to Peirce, those third-party tokens carry âunique risks,â especially for retail investors who may not actually own the underlying asset. âA token could be a âreceipt for a security,â which is itself a security but is distinct from the underlying security,â Peirce explained. Or worse, it could qualify as a âsecurity-based swap,â whichÂ are typically used by sophisticated investors and are heavily regulated, often restricted from being traded by everyday people (“retail persons”) off of regulated exchanges. If a token falls into this category, it could face severe trading restrictions. Tokenization could reshape how regular people invest, borrow, and access wealth. But it also raises serious questions: Who actually owns these tokenized assets? What happens when a crypto firm collapses or loses customer funds? And what protections do Main Street investors have? Tokenization could make markets faster and more accessible, even allowing people to own fractions of stocks and assets. But Peirceâs statement throws cold water on the idea that blockchain makes all that risk-free. The SECâs message is that innovation must come with compliance. Peirce, one of the more crypto-friendly voices at the agency, still made it clear: âThe process of issuing an instrument representing a security is not new.â Whether it lives on-chain or off-chain, itâs still under the SECâs jurisdiction. Peirce encouraged firms to engage with the SEC early and often if they want to build tokenized products legally. She also hinted that the agency is open to modernizing outdated rules or creating exemptions, but only if firms play by the rules. For now, the crypto and finance industries have been put on notice. Tokenized finance isnât a legal gray zone. Itâs Wall Street on-chain. The message is clear: the future of finance will be built on innovation, but also on accountability.

Title: NVIDIA became the first $4 trillion company — here's how the tech giant beat Microsoft and Apple

The AI arms race drove NVIDIA to become a $4 trillion company. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. NVIDIA was briefly worth $4 trillion this week. The tech giant passed that milestone and became the first $4 trillion company following a 2.5% increase in stock value at one point on July 9, 2025. The valuation of NVIDIA has since dropped to around $3.97 trillion. NVIDIA began 2025 behind Microsoft and Apple, but steady growth has pushed NVIDIA past other tech giants. Growth is expected to continue for NVIDIA. The company provides computing power for several of the biggest AI tools, which has proven quite lucrative for the GPU maker. NVIDIA's surge to a $4 trillion valuation is due largely to the company's dominance in the AI space. As companies race to integrate AI into everything from computers to personal assistants, the demand for computing power increases. Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, Google, and other companies release AI-powered products regularly and have integrated AI into existing services. Microsoft was reportedly NVIDIA's largest customer in 2024, outspending Meta, Google, and other tech giants. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. ChatGPT launched in 2022, sparking an AI arms race. NVIDIA's value has increased fifteenfold since OpenAI released its AI-powered tool. "Global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate," said NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang when discussing financial results in May 2025. It was more than an initial surge for NVIDIA. The tech giant reached a $2 trillion valuation in February 2024 and then passed the $3 trillion mark just four months later. NVIDIA's stock price now sits around $163, though that will fluctuate throughout the week. Shares are up about 22% on the year for NVIDIA. NVIDIA stock dipped slightly, dropping the company's value to just under $4 trillion. But given recent trends, it is likely NVIDIA will pass the milestone again. It's more than NVIDIA stock that's risen over the last few years. The company brought in $44.1 billion in revenue in the financial quarter ending in April 2025. That was a 69% year-over-year increase for the tech giant. Sean Endicott is a tech journalist at Windows Central, specializing in Windows, Microsoft software, AI, and PCs.

Title: Pomerantz Law Firm Announces the Filing of a Class Action Against iRobot Corporation and Certain Officers – IRBT

July 10, 2025 09:00 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, July 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: MP Materials Stock Surges 50% on Rare Earths Contract With Defense Department

Shares of MP Materials (MP) surged 50% in Thursday morning after the rare earths miner announced a multibillion-dollar agreement with the Department of Defense. The DoD is set to become MP Materials' largest shareholder at 15% following an initial $400 million purchase of a new class of "preferred stock convertible into shares of the Company's common stock, and a warrant permitting DoD to purchase additional shares of the Company's common stock." MP Materials will use the government investment, along with a $1 billion funding line from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) to fund the construction of its second domestic magnet manufacturing facility at a yet-to-be-decided location. The company also agreed to a 10-year deal with the DoD establishing the government as a long-term customer of MP's rare earths with a price floor of $110 per kilogram. The Trump administration has stated that becoming less dependent on other nations like China for rare earths—metals used in production of a variety of commercial and military products—is a top priority and national security concern. Shares of MP and USA Rare Earth (USAR) have been boosted this year by that commitment. MP Materials hit their highest price since April 2022 on Thursday morning, while USA Rare Earth shares were up nearly 14% shortly after markets opened. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

July 10, 2025 08:18 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, July 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

LAST UPDATE | 10 Jul FORMER IRISH OLYMPIC swimming coach George Gibney, who is facing up to 79 charges, including attempted rape, relating to the alleged sexual abuse of four girls in Ireland, has agreed to be extradited from the US to Dublin. Gibney, who was arrested in Florida last week, has withdrawn his application to contest his extradition ahead of a court appearance tomorrow, according to court documents seen by The Journal. The 77-year-old was living in the US for 30 years and was wanted for 79 alleged sexual assault offences, 78 for indecent assault and one for attempted rape, against four girls between 1 January 1971 and 14 August 1974. Gibney was the founder of the Trojan Swimming Club in Blackrock in Dublin, where he also worked as a coach. He was also the Irish national swimming coach until 1991. He was previously charged with 27 sexual offences in 1993, which were dropped in 1994 after Gibney secured a High Court injunction which prevented the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) from prosecuting him. Gibney then left Ireland for Scotland, where he continued to work as a swimming coach. He has lived in the United States since 1995. In 1997, a Garda investigation into Gibney was opened after fresh allegations were made against him. Advertisement A specialist unit within the Garda National Protective Services Bureau launched a detailed inquiry after a garda probe was reopened in 2020 when several people made allegations on a BBC and Second Captains podcast titled ‘Where is George Gibney?’. After a three-year investigation, a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who recommended charging Gibney. Court documents relating to the case, lodged last week, refer to the podcast series extensively. The podcast series centred on the survivors of sexual abuse by the accused. A number of alleged victims emerged after an appeal was issued for people with any information to come forward. He was arrested in Florida last week, where he has been living for nearly three decades, on foot of an international warrant which was issued by Irish authorities. It is understood that Irish and US law enforcement had prepared for the arrest for over a week. Gibney appeared before Orlando District Court Judge Daniel Irick for 11 minutes last week. He was remanded in the custody of US Marshals to appear before the same judge tomorrow for a detention hearing. Court documents filed ahead of the hearing yesterday, which have been seen by The Journal, state that Gibney withdrew his application to contest the extradition and agreed to being extradited to Ireland after being advised of his rights earlier this week.

US stock market today opened slightly lower as Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures paused after a powerful tech rally led by Nvidia, which just hit a historic $4 trillion market value. Meanwhile, President Trump’s new tariff threats—including a proposed 50% import tax on Brazil and extra tariffs on BRICS nations—are now in focus. As Wall Street prepares for Q2 earnings with Delta Airlines reporting first, investors are balancing excitement around AI stocks with global trade uncertainty. The Nasdaq hit a record high, but attention now turns to jobless claims and the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates.

Title: Forbes Daily: Nvidia Reaches A $4 Trillion Milestone

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. AI juggernaut Nvidia just crossed another milestone: a $4 trillion valuation, the largest in history. The firm, which was worth just over $10 billion a decade ago, now outranks household names like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in training advanced artificial intelligence programs. It’s hard to grasp just how much money $4 trillion is, but for some context: The company of less than 40,000 people is now worth more than 97% of the world’s economies, the entire New York area real estate market and the combined net worth of the 30 richest people in the world. Linda Yaccarino X CEO Linda Yaccarino announced her resignation Wednesday, just one day after Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok made a series of antisemitic comments on the social media platform—though a source told NBC News that the exit has been in the works for over a week. On X, Musk wrote: “Thank you for your contributions,” in response to the former advertising executive’s departure after a two-year stint leading the company. It’s unclear who will succeed her. MORE: Later Wednesday night, xAI launched the latest and most advanced version of its AI model: Grok 4. In a nearly hour-long livestream, Musk and xAI staffers demoed the new model, which Musk said was “smarter than almost all graduate students in all disciplines, simultaneously.” The billionaire did not address Grok’s recent controversial posts. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell Good news for investors eagerly awaiting lower borrowing costs: Most Federal Reserve officials still expect interest rate cuts this year, according to minutes released from its recent meeting, but tariffs could complicate the Fed’s efforts to fight price increases. Still, many members of the central bank’s rate-setting panel noted that the inflationary impacts of tariffs could be more limited if trade deals are reached soon. As President Donald Trump suggested he’d implement a 50% tariff on copper imports, the price of the metal skyrocketed in its largest intraday surge since the 1980s, before paring back some of its gains Wednesday. The levies would likely increase prices for copper in the U.S., analysts predicted, as just over half of the total refined copper consumed in the U.S. is imported. MORE: Higher copper costs could also lead to an increase in crime, as the metal would become a valuable target for thieves. It’s the third-most consumed metal in the U.S., with uses ranging from electrical wiring in buildings to computers and cars, and is often stolen from construction sites. Critics of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” argue that it takes from the poor to benefit the wealthy, but not all billionaires are celebrating its passage. Some of the bill’s measures are more likely to help multi-millionaires than billionaires, and a number of the world’s richest people are concerned about the expected $3.4 trillion that will be added to the deficit by 2034 as a result of the legislation. One estate planning attorney told Forbes some of his billionaire clients are moving more of their wealth offshore to “more stable economies.” Adam Valkin, who helped grow General Catalyst into a global venture capital powerhouse, wants to help Israeli founders break into the U.S. market in his new role at Vine Ventures. Valkin will help the firm invest in the country known as “Startup Nation,” as—despite experiencing a drop in investments after the October 7 attack—Israeli startups have raised $3.1 billion so far in 2025. After Shaun Maguire of Sequoia Capital received swift backlash for his comments about New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a letter supporting the venture capital firm partner garnered hundreds of signatures. The letter defending Maguire claims his remarks, including accusing Mamdani of being an “Islamist,” did not constitute hate speech, even as nearly 1,000 tech founders demanded Sequoia take disciplinary action. Carlo Ancelotti Former Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has been sentenced to one year in prison and will pay a hefty fine after being found guilty of tax fraud. He had been accused of failing to pay over $1.1 million in Spanish taxes related to image rights. Managing Real Madrid is a big deal in the world of professional sports—the team topped Forbes’ list of The World’s Most Valuable Soccer Teams in 2025, the fourth year in a row it ranked No. 1. Billionaire Bill Ackman’s wildcard entry into the Hall of Fame Open tennis tournament ended in swift defeat Wednesday, drawing criticism from fans and officials who questioned whether the hedge fund manager had earned his spot in the professional event. Participants in the tournament are typically selected based on ATP rankings, wildcard entries and qualifiers. Randy Walker, the director for the Vero Beach Futures tennis tournament, posted on X after the match: “I just watched the absolute worst professional tennis match I have ever seen.” Photo by Matt Roth for The Washington Post via Getty Images Even as child care remains a major hurdle for many working parents, few companies are taking advantage of a federal tax break given to firms that provide child care for their employees, according to IRS data. But the just-signed tax and budget bill includes a little-known provision that more than triples the Employer-Provided Childcare Tax Credit, and data shows that child care benefits are helping companies’ bottom lines. Les Wexner Five years ago, Ohio’s most revered entrepreneur Les Wexner stepped down as chairman of L Brands and soon began to sell off his stake in the Victoria’s Secret parent company amid controversy over his close relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Many believed that Wexner, then age 82, would quietly retire. Instead, the fashion mogul has more than doubled his fortune thanks in large part to some savvy bets in a different industry: technology. Over just the past three months, his net worth—which includes assets held in his children’s and wife Abigail’s names—has soared to $10.1 billion from $7.9 billion, according to Forbes’ estimates. The biggest driver of this increase: a 4% stake in CoreWeave, one of the buzziest artificial intelligence companies. On Monday, CoreWeave announced it is buying crypto miner Core Scientific in a roughly $9 billion all-stock deal. CoreWeave’s market capitalization has almost tripled since its March IPO to nearly $73 billion today, and Wexner’s stake is now worth $2.8 billion. The eight-year-old CoreWeave helps companies build data centers and loans out cloud access to much-sought-after graphics processing units, or GPUs, which firms like Microsoft, IBM and Meta pay to use to build AI models. With no shortage of customers, the company recorded $982 million in revenue during the first quarter of this year, a 420% increase versus the same quarter last year. However, it’s yet to turn a profit and reported a net loss of $315 million during the same period. WHY IT MATTERS “After originally making a fortune in fashion, Wexner has become one of the biggest (and most unlikely) winners of the AI gold rush,” says Forbes staff writer Jemima McEvoy. “In addition to becoming an early backer of the $73 billion (market cap) CoreWeave, one of the buzziest AI companies around, Wexner's real estate development firm has played a crucial role in bringing big tech players like Meta, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Intel to Central Ohio.” MORE How Victoria’s Secret Billionaire Owner Accidentally Scored A $800 Million Stake In An AI Unicorn Millions of borrowers will soon be on the hook for thousands of extra dollars as the Trump Administration is slated to start charging interest next month on student loans under the Biden-era SAVE plan. Borrowers enrolled in the plan have had their loans in forbearance since last summer while it’s been held up in court: About 7.84 million: The number of borrowers with loans under the SAVE plan that will be affected by the change $3,500: The amount in additional interest per year that the average borrower enrolled in the SAVE plan will be charged, which works out to about $300 per month 1.5 million: How many applicants for income-driven repayment plans were yet to be processed, the Education Department said in a June court filing Many employees have experienced “quiet firing,” where a manager makes a work environment so unpleasant that it pushes people to quit. Sometimes quiet firing occurs because a boss isn’t doing their job, or it could just be part of the company culture—it’s an easier way for firms to reduce headcount without very public layoffs. If you’ve been silently pushed out, try not to take it personally: You deserve a workplace that supports your growth.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, climbing thanks to a perfect storm of U.S. president Donald Trump’s embrace of crypto and Wall Street piling into bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—with a “huge” BlackRock ETF bombshell suddenly appearing on the horizon. Now, as traders eye “trillions and trillions” of dollars that some think could be about to flow into bitcoin and crypto, a closely-watched Wall Street analyst has predicted the “floodgates” are about to open for crypto ETFs. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has helped power a bitcoin price boom over the last year, with some ... More predicting the bitcoin rally could be just getting started. The bitcoin and crypto ETF landscape is braced for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve multiple spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds and create a "framework" that would make the approval process for future crypto ETF applications much quicker, according to a report by The Block that cited an anonymous source. "Then we will see the floodgates open on these other assets, but that’s what I’m waiting for," Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said on an X Spaces broadcast, adding he expects a draft of the framework could emerge as soon as this month, with implementation possible by September or October. The SEC, which has pivoted from being hostile to bitcoin and crypto under the Biden administration to pro-crypto under Trump, has issued new guidance this month on disclosure requirements for exchange-traded products tied to cryptocurrencies, described by Reuters as “the first step toward approval of dozens of applications for ETFs linked to everything from solana and XRP to president Donald Trump’s eponymous meme coin.” "The SEC is moving forward on creating a framework for how they’d like to see all these crypto assets included in investment funds" to address the "explosion" in the number of ETFs now awaiting a regulatory verdict, Sui Chung, chief executive of crypto index provider CF Benchmarks, told the newswire. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has doubled over the last year, climbing to an all-time high of just over $112,000 ... More per bitcoin. “What we’re seeing is a long-overdue recalibration from speculation to structural adoption as mandates are being rewritten around digital assets,” Ryan Chow, cofounder of bitcoin finance platform Solv Protocol, said in emailed comments. “Bitcoin’s new all-time high is a signal of growing institutional maturity and global confidence in crypto as an asset class.” BlackRock, which manages around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024 that now hold 1.2 million bitcoin worth around $140 billion. BlackRock’s fund alone holds around 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth $77 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network.

The silicon valley chip maker briefly topped a record-breaking $4 trillion valuation. Nvidia has seen a consistent rise over the past two years, as enthusiasm for AI-powered tech continues. Shortly after the US stock market opened on Wednesday morning, Nvidia's stock price surged to $164.42. This pushed it briefly to a valuation of $4 trillion, a market value greater than the GDP of France, the UK, or India. The success at the Californian chip company has been helping the wider stock market recover after a downturn in April, partly prompted by US President Donald Trump announcing widespread tariffs. Trump's ongoing trade war sent global markets plummeting. Nvidia, led by Taiwan-born Jensen Huang, has seen a consistent rise over the past two years as this enthusiasm over AI has boomed. Many big tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta, have also joined the multi-billion dollar AI race. "The market has an incredible certainty that AI is the future," Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers told AFP news agency. "Nvidia is certainly the company most positioned to benefit from that gold rush." In early 2025, Nvidia and generative AI such as OpenAI were challenged by the arrival of China-based DeepSeek. DeepSeek disrupted the AI world with a low-cost, high-performance model. Nvidia lost some $600 billion in market valuation in a single trading session at that time. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video After Trump's tariffs hit the tech sector hard in April, Nvidia quickly bounced back. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia reported earnings of nearly $19 billion despite a $4.5 billion hit from US government export controls which limit chip sales to China. In May, the company reached a deal to build AI infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, during a Trump state visit. "We've seen the administration using Nvidia chips as a bargaining chip," said Angelo Zino, technology analyst at CFRA Research. Even as Trump has announced new tariffs in recent days, US stocks have remained high, with the tech-centered Nasdaq closing at a new record on Wednesday. Shares in Nvidia closed on Wednesday with a market value of $3.972 trillion. Edited by: Elizabeth Schumacher

Title: Despite current expensive valuations, Indian market still holds significant upside in the longer term: Tata AMC Fund Manager

Edited excerpts: Your views on the broader markets? In terms of broader market performance, we are in a volatile phase with low returns over the past year. Although markets have rallied over the last couple of months, if we look at the last one-year returns, it’s a low single-digit number. One can attribute this to expensive valuations and a slowdown in the economy. We didn’t see a massive correction, which typically happens when markets are expensive, as, structurally, India stays one of the most preferred markets from a long-term perspective. India, being the fastest-growing economy, has fiscal checks in place, and even if one looks at the corporate sector, we are seeing one of the lowest levels of debt/equity. Even the banking sector is at its lowest levels of NPAs. This gives confidence to the investors from a long-term perspective. With stronger balance sheets, fiscal stability and liquidity measures from the RBI, the growth should recover, leading to double-digit earnings growth over the next two-three years. Given the current high valuations in the Indian market, do you see room for further upside? Where are the opportunities? Despite the current expensive valuations, we believe the Indian market still holds significant upside in the longer term. We are likely to see a return to double-digit earnings growth, driven by strong corporate balance sheets, robust asset quality in the banking sector and positive liquidity measures from the RBI. The credit growth, which was in the high teens last year, has come down to a high single-digit number now. While we might experience sideways movement in the near term, the structural factors supporting the economy make the market attractive for long-term investors. How is Tata Asset Management positioning its equity portfolios given the global uncertainties — geopolitical risks and rate movements? Given the global uncertainties, the markets have remained volatile. While the Indian market has had sideways movement and low returns over the past few quarters, we continue to see India as an attractive investment destination. This is because of the strength of the banking sector, the stability of corporate balance sheets and fiscal policy measures that are in place. The RBI has also been injecting a lot of liquidity into the system to propel credit growth, which was seeing some slowdown. Despite these short-term challenges, these structural factors support a long-term positive outlook. Have you observed any notable shifts in investor preferences — for example, increased appetite for passive funds or international exposure? The focus is on long-term market potential. Investors should consider India’s growth trajectory when making investment decisions, and with the attractiveness of India as an investment destination, we can assume there may be a growing appetite for exposure to Indian equity markets, including potentially through passive funds. Passive is becoming one of the choices for investors along with active funds. One of the funds you handle is pharma & healthcare... How do you see tariffs or threat of tariff from the US impacting this sector? How prepared are you? When one analyses the India pharma exports from the US perspective, India has a very strategic presence, with: the highest number of USFDA-approved plants in India, creating such a large eco-system can take multiple years; a large volume share in the US oral pharma market today — can be pegged anywhere between 60 and 75 per cent. But when we look at it from India’s perspective, Indian companies selling in the US market are not generating remarkably high ROE/ROCEs in their generic supplies, except for a few one-time opportunities, which may not last long. Hence, any significant pressure on the margins of Indian companies due to the tariff might push them to calibrate their US market strategy. In our pharma fund, we have moved towards higher exposure to healthcare names, given the comfort on growth and outlook. Pharma stocks, at the same time, have seen a decent run over the last year and the valuations are trading higher vs the long-term average. You largely handle sectoral themes. Throw some light on that. I manage diversified funds as well as a technology theme fund. The IT sector has seen a sharp correction over the last six months, due to concerns in the US economy. Enterprise in the US had cut on the discretionary spends since 2022 due to higher inflation, increasing interest rates and the fear of a slowdown in the macros in the US. These concerns are continuing due to the tariff uncertainties, leading to the third year of lower growth for the IT services companies. However, the correction has driven the valuation to a reasonable level, and the sector can see some re-rating if the growth outlook improves. From a sell-side analyst to buy-side, how is your transmission now? I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to work for esteemed organisations in the industry, both on the buy side as well as the sell side. A sell-side role helps you with building deep expertise in specific industries and sharpening analytical skills, while on the buy-side, it helps with adding more dimensions to these skills by looking at multiple sectors instead of focusing on any single industry. The buy-side industry also helps build critical thinking and decision-making capabilities. Published on July 10, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

July 10, 2025 05:54 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, July 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Counter-UAS (C-UAS) Systems - Market and Technology Forecast to 2033" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This study examines, analyses, and predicts the evolution of C-UAS technologies, markets, and outlays (expenditures) over the 2025-2033 period in the aerospace industry. It also examines markets geographically, focusing on the top 95% of global markets, in the North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and Latin America. Throughout the report, we show how C-UAS systems are used today to add real value, as well as how will they can evolve in the near and distant future. To provide the most thorough and realistic forecast, this report considers all stated and derived scenarios. C-UAS systems are designed to detect, track, and neutralize unmanned aerial systems (UAS), performing the full spectrum of counter-drone operations. These platforms integrate a variety of sensors and mitigation tools to address specific mission requirements. Upon identifying a drone threat, a C-UAS system can respond using either soft-kill or hard-kill techniques. Soft-kill methods disrupt or take control of a drone without physical damage - forcing it to land, return to base, or enabling an operator to seize control. Hard-kill methods involve physically disabling or destroying the drone, often using kinetic or directed energy weapons to neutralize the threat. The market players include large as well as mid to small sized companies with expertise in manufacturing and system integration. The C-UAS market is at a nascent stage. The key factors driving the market are increasing deployment of drones for illicit reasons as well as rising drone warfare in areas of border tensions. In order to keep up with the evolving nature of threats from drone technologies, the technology required behind countermeasures for detection, tracking and mitigation of drones is becoming increasingly sophisticated. From radio waves to electro-optic/infrared to direct energy weapons, various effectors are being tested in different combinations to be integrated on C-UAS systems. Additionally, high-powered computing with integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) over 5G network is estimated to be a significant part in addressing the complex drone threats. These technological innovations will drive the spending in the market as they make the systems more efficient in addressing the threats and provide security to life and infrastructure against UAS attacks.

(Reuters: Robert Galbraith) Nvidia has become the first publicly traded company to surpass a $US4 trillion ($6.12 trillion) market valuation. The milestone highlights what has been widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since the introduction of the first iPhone 18 years ago. AI bellwether Nvidia is now worth $US900 billion more than Apple. Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia has become the first publicly traded company to surpass a $US4 trillion ($6.12 trillion) market valuation. It puts the latest exclamation point on the investor frenzy surrounding an artificial intelligence boom powered by its industry-leading processors. Although Nvidia's market value dipped back below $US4 trillion by the time the stock market closed, the milestone marked what is being widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since Apple co-founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago. Underscoring the changing of the guard, AI bellwether Nvidia is now worth $US900 billion more than Apple, which rode the iPhone's success to become the first publicly traded company to be valued at $US1 trillion, $US2 trillion and eventually, $US3 trillion. Technology multinational Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company, dethroning tech heavyweight Microsoft as its high-end processors play a central role in a scramble to dominate artificial intelligence computing. Nvidia's rise comes as Apple has struggled to deliver on its ambitions to infuse the iPhone and other products with more AI. In the meantime, former Apple design guru Jony Ive has joined OpenAI to work on a wearable AI device that could challenge the iPhone, while Nvidia has been scrambling to meet the feverish demand for its specialised chips. And tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are upping the AI ante too, collectively budgeting about $US325 billion for investments in the technology this year, with a significant amount of that money likely to flow into Nvidia's coffers. The ravenous appetite for Nvidia's chips are the main reason the company's stock price have increased 10-fold since early 2023, catapulting its market value from about $US400 billion to $US4 trillion. After exceeding $US4 trillion for the first time early on Wednesday, Nvidia's shares backtracked below that threshold at their closing price of $US162.88. But most analysts do not expect the price to stay below $US163 for long. In a sign of the pervasive optimism surrounding Nvidia, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino on Wednesday issued a research note predicting the stock would climb to $US196 within the next year to push the company's market value to $US4.8 trillion. Jensen Huang's widening fame has been accompanied by a fattening fortune. (AP: Sarah Meyssonnier) Nvidia's rapid rise also has anointed the company's founder and CEO Jensen Huang as "the godfather" of AI, with his dissertations about the technology's direction attracting enraptured audiences. Mr Huang's widening fame also has been accompanied by a fattening fortune, now estimated at $US142 billion. It looked like Nvidia might have hit a road block in early April when US President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs and triggered a widespread sell-off on the stock market that hit the tech sector especially hard. At its nadir, Nvidia's stock price slipped below $US87. But Nvidia quickly bounced and in late May delivered another stellar quarter, highlighted by a $US18.8 billion profit, despite a $US4.5 billion hit to account for US government restrictions on the sale of some of its chips to China. The California company is scheduled to release its next quarterly report on August 27.

Title: Watch These Nvidia Stock Price Levels as AI Chip Giant Hits $4 Trillion Market Value

Time Published: 2025-07-09T22:18:34Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA) shares hit a record high Wednesday as the AI investor favorite became the first company ever to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion. Nvidia shares have risen 88% from their early-April low and are up 20% since the start of the year, boosted by expectations that major technology companies will continue snapping up the chip giant's products as they build out their AI capabilities. Nvidia shares closed Wednesday's session nearly 2% higher at around $163, leaving the market value just shy of the milestone level it briefly surpassed early in the day. Below, we break down the technicals on Nvidia’s weekly chart and identify price levels that investors will likely be watching. Since forming a bullish engulfing pattern in early April, Nvidia shares have trended sharply higher, with the price climbing back above the 50-week moving average (MA) in May on its way toward its recent highs. Moreover, the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum, but remains below overbought levels, indicating the shares have more room to test higher prices before consolidating. However, it’s worth pointing out that trading volume has steadily declined during the stock’s move higher in recent months, suggesting that larger market participants may remain on the sidelines. Let’s apply technical analysis to Nvidia’s chart to forecast how a longer-term uptrend in the stock may play out and also identify key support levels worth watching during potential retracements. Investors can forecast where Nvidia shares may be headed next by applying bars pattern analysis, a tool that analyzes prior trends to project how a future directional move may take shape. When applying the analysis to Nvidia’s chart, we extract the price bars comprising the strong trending period from January to August 2023 and overlay them from the stock’s recent close above the 50-week MA. This projects an upside target of around $300 and indicates the move higher could last until late December this year if a similar trend emerges. We selected this prior trend as it also followed a bullish close above the 50-week SMA and has closely replicated the stock's current price action in recent weeks. During pullbacks in the stock, it’s initially worth watching the $130 level. The shares could find support in this area near the upward sloping 50-week MA and a trendline that connects a series of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to June last year. Finally, the bulls’ failure to successfully defend this level could see Nvidia shares fall to lower support around $97. Investors may look for buying opportunities in this region near the prominent March 2024 swing high, which sit just above major lows that formed on the chart in August latter that year and April this year.

Title: Delete WhatsApp and Install Signal

Time Published: 2025-07-09T22:15:56Z
Full Content:
Andrew Steele WhatsApp is the world's most popular instant messaging service, and it's owned by Meta—the same company behind Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. If you value your privacy and digital security, I strongly recommend removing all of these apps from your phone. If there are any you absolutely can't live without, at minimum revoke every permission you can to protect yourself from the serious privacy and security risks these apps pose. The best alternative to WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger is Signal, which offers genuinely private and secure messaging. Signal encrypts all your messages and metadata, meaning Signal itself knows almost nothing about you. Crucially, it's run by a nonprofit organisation, not a corporation whose entire business model depends on harvesting your personal data to sell targeted advertising. For Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, you're far safer accessing them through your web browser rather than installing their apps. Even if most of your contacts use WhatsApp, you can make a difference by encouraging the people you contact the most to move to Signal. If most of your messages are on Signal—and then likely the most sensitive ones too—you can start to take back your privacy. And secondly, if we all start to do this, it will mean more people are on Signal, hopefully gradually making it more attractive to move across! If you don't read any further, this is the short version: Delete Meta's apps, use Signal for messaging, and access social media through your browser instead. While WhatsApp claims* your message contents are end-to-end encrypted, Meta extensively collects the 'metadata' around your conversations. This includes who you message, when you message them, how often you communicate, and your location data. WhatsApp's privacy policy states that the app collects extensive usage logs, including the time, frequency, and duration of your activities. This metadata collection creates a detailed profile of your most private relationships and activities. If you message your therapist, doctor, lawyer, or visit sensitive locations like medical clinics, Meta instantly knows something deeply personal about you—information that could be legally or personally compromising. Even worse, they scan your entire contact list to build social networks of people who may not even use Meta's services, creating detailed profiles of individuals who never consented to this data collection. * Because WhatsApp is ‘closed-source’, we can’t examine the code to check their claims. However, given that you can report messages to Meta for violating the terms of use, they clearly do have mechanisms to read messages. Signal, on the other hand, is ‘open-source’, meaning that anyone can read the source code, and independent experts have verified that it’s private and secure. Meta's track record on privacy is…not great. Here are some of their most egregious violations: Meta allowed Cambridge Analytica to harvest data from up to 87 million Facebook users without their consent, which was then used to manipulate political campaigns. The company was fined $5 billion by the FTC for this breach—yet their stock price actually went up after the fine was announced, showing how little these penalties actually deter such behaviour. Between September 2024 and early June 2025, Meta's Android apps (Facebook and Instagram) covertly tracked users' web browsing, even in incognito mode, or if using a VPN. Meta used this method without obtaining consent from users, linking browsing history to Facebook and Instagram profiles. This tracking was so invasive that even Google called it abusive. The fact that Meta was willing to engage in such underhanded data collection means that simply having one of their apps on your phone poses a serious privacy and security risk. Facebook used phone numbers that users provided for security purposes (like two-factor authentication) for advertising targeting—a direct violation of user trust and their stated privacy policies. And, just a few weeks ago, WhatsApp started asking users to add their email address ‘for extra security’. Uh-huh… Meta now requires you to manually opt out of having your WhatsApp conversations fed to their AI in every single chat you participate in. This feature was rolled out with virtually no fanfare—I discovered this 'feature' by accident, meaning my private conversations had probably already been processed by Meta's AI systems. While Meta claims this is only for local AI features like enhanced search (eg, if you type ‘find me that time Andrew complained about how terrible WhatsApp is for privacy’ into the search bar, and it will dig out that bit of chat), the reality is that training data for AI models is one of the most valuable commodities in tech today. Given Meta’s track record of privacy violations, can you trust them not to use your intimate conversations in their ongoing AI development? The Facebook app now includes a setting asking users to upload every photo on their camera roll to Meta's AI for 'cloud processing' and unspecified 'suggestions'. Think about what's in your photo library: that picture of a rash you took to show the doctor, pictures of your whole family on the beach in swimwear, that snap you took of your passport in case you lose it, screenshots of personal information… Do you really want Meta having access to every image you've ever captured on your phone? And can you be sure that Meta won’t roll out a ‘feature’ like this to their other apps in future? Again, images are a hugely valuably commodity for AI training these days—the incentive is definitely there for Meta to hoover them all up. Meta makes plenty of money from WhatsApp both by using the data it gathers to serve ads on its other platforms and by business accounts paying for certain features. But apparently this isn’t enough, and there are ads directly in WhatsApp now. This is just in the ‘stories’ tab for now—which honestly I don’t use very much—but it really wouldn’t come as a surprise to get a ‘helpful’ suggestion for a pizza place next time I’m telling someone that I’m hungry in a WhatsApp chat…or maybe an ad for a therapist next time I mention I’m not feeling great? When advertising is the primary business model, privacy inevitably takes second place. The safest approach is to completely uninstall all Meta apps from your phone. If you absolutely must keep some for work or social reasons, you can try to limit the risk by doing the following: However, given Meta's willingness to exploit Android vulnerabilities for covert tracking, having any of their apps installed remains a privacy risk. I wish I could delete WhatsApp entirely, but it requires a critical mass of people to make the switch before Signal becomes the default messaging platform. That's where you come in. Try Signal today, and convince your friends and family to join you. It's one of the simplest and most effective actions you can take to protect not just your own privacy, but to help create a more secure digital world for everyone. The choice is clear: continue letting Meta profit from your most intimate communications, or take control of your digital privacy. What will you choose? Your email address will not be published.

Major U.S. equities indexes rose Wednesday as AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) became the first company in the world to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization and President Trump released letters to more trading partners outlining tariff rates set to take effect on Aug. 1. The S&P 500 advanced 0.6%, closing just shy of a new record. The Dow ended the midweek session up 0.5%, while outperformance from the tech sector helped the Nasdaq climbed 0.9% to a record closing high. Shares of AES Corp. (AES) skyrocketed 19.8%, leading gains on the S&P 500 following reports that the power generator is exploring a sale. Several major infrastructure investors including BlackRock's (BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners unit have been evaluating an acquisition of AES amid declines in its share price over the past few years, Bloomberg reported. AES generates energy from a variety of sources, including hydro, wind, and solar, and has signed agreements with multiple tech firms to provide renewable energy for data centers. Reports of a potential takeover bid also helped lift shares of engineering design software firm PTC Inc. (PTC), which surged 17.7%. Bloomberg indicated that rival Autodesk (ADSK), which competes with PTC in the computer-aided design and product lifecycle management markets, is evaluating a potential acquisition. Autodesk shares slipped 2.4%. Major cryptocurrencies moved higher, with the price of Bitcoin hitting a record high around $112,000 amid optimism about a crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the U.S. under the Trump administration. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., advanced 5.4%, adding to a string of recent gains leaving the stock up over 50% since the start of the year. Newly released minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed that policymakers believe tariff-related inflationary pressure will be moderate and still anticipate interest-rate cuts in 2025. The projection for potential Fed rate cuts and the likelihood of lower mortgage rates helped lift housing-related stocks. D.R. Horton (DHI) shares gained 5.4% Shares of fellow home builders Lennar (LEN) and PulteGroup (PHM), as well as shares of residential construction supplier Builders FirstSource (BLDR), all added around 4.5%. Boeing (BA) shares climbed 3.7%, a day after the company reported it delivered 150 commercial jets in the second quarter, up from 92 in the year-ago period and ahead of analysts' forecasts. The aviation giant also topped expectations for quarterly deliveries of helicopters and jets in its defense segment. Shares of data analytics firm Fair Isaac (FICO) logged the weakest performance in the S&P 500 for the second straight session, dropping 6.5% Wednesday. The two-day slide came after Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, indicated that lenders will be able to evaluate the creditworthiness of mortgage borrowers using the VantageScore system, a competitor to Fair Isaac's FICO credit scores. Hershey (HSY) shares fell 4.7% after the chocolate maker named a new CEO. The confectionery company announced that Kirk Tanner, who currently serves as the top executive for fast-food giant Wendy's (WEN), will take the helm at Hershey starting next month. Tanner is slated to replace retiring Hershey CEO Michele Buck. Rothschild & Co Redburn analysts downgraded Monster Beverage (MNST) stock to "neutral" from "buy," suggesting that tariffs on aluminum imports could weigh on the performance of the energy drink maker. Monster Beverage shares sank 3.3%.

Title: Who Should Avoid the Nasdaq QQQ ETF? Risks and Drawbacks Explained
URL: https://typeforyou.org/who-should-avoid-the-nasdaq-qqq-etf/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T21:17:37Z
Full Content:
The Nasdaq QQQ ETF is often praised for its outstanding performance, particularly during technology-driven bull markets. Backed by the Nasdaq-100 index, QQQ gives investors exposure to some of the most innovative and fastest-growing companies in the world, like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. But while it’s a fan favorite for growth-seeking investors, the Nasdaq QQQ ETF isn’t a one-size-fits-all investment. Lets break down who should avoid the Nasdaq QQQ ETF, explore its potential risks and limitations, and explain why it’s not suitable for every portfolio. Whether you’re a new investor, a conservative saver, or a retiree managing withdrawals, this guide will help you decide if QQQ belongs in your investment strategy. Contents The Invesco QQQ Trust (ticker: QQQ) is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index. This index includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. It’s heavily weighted in technology, but also includes sectors like consumer discretionary, communication services, and healthcare. The fund is widely regarded as a strong option for long-term growth investors. But like any investment, it comes with trade-offs. Before diving into why you might want to avoid it, let’s touch on why many investors love QQQ: But these strengths can quickly turn into weaknesses if they don’t align with your risk tolerance or investment goals. Let’s break down the types of investors who might want to steer clear of QQQ, and the reasons why. The Nasdaq QQQ ETF is built for aggressive growth, not stability. It often experiences sharper declines during market downturns due to its high exposure to tech and other volatile sectors. If you’re looking for a safe, low-volatility investment for peace of mind, QQQ likely isn’t the best fit. Investors who are in or approaching retirement usually prioritize capital preservation and income over growth. QQQ’s volatility and low dividend yield make it less suitable for this stage of life. If you’re withdrawing funds regularly, a more conservative, income-focused ETF or bond allocation may be more appropriate. If you follow a value investing strategy—buying undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals—then QQQ likely doesn’t align with your approach. Value investors often prefer funds that track the Russell 1000 Value Index or individual stocks with low valuations. QQQ is highly concentrated in technology and a few mega-cap stocks. If you’re looking for balanced exposure across sectors, QQQ might not give you what you need. If true diversification is your goal, consider a total market ETF like VTI or a multi-sector portfolio. While QQQ has delivered incredible long-term returns, it can be extremely volatile in the short term. Many traders get in expecting fast profits and panic sell during corrections. If you’re not prepared for the ups and downs, or you’re new to investing, QQQ might lead to losses instead of gains. Aside from being a poor fit for certain investors, there are inherent risks with investing in QQQ. Understanding these helps you make better decisions. QQQ is heavily weighted in a small number of mega-cap tech stocks. If a few of these companies underperform, the entire ETF suffers. With tech dominating the fund, sector-specific downturns (like tech crashes or regulatory crackdowns) can disproportionately hurt performance. QQQ isn’t ideal for income investors. The yield is much lower than broader market ETFs or dividend-focused funds. High-growth tech stocks generally underperform in rising interest rate environments. This makes QQQ vulnerable when rates are hiked. Some of QQQ’s top holdings have high valuation multiples. If earnings fail to meet expectations, prices can fall hard. If QQQ doesn’t align with your goals or risk tolerance, here are some alternatives: Despite the drawbacks, QQQ can still be a great investment for the right investor: The key is understanding the risks and making sure they align with your strategy. The Nasdaq QQQ ETF is powerful, but it isn’t perfect. It shines in bull markets and tech rallies, but stumbles during periods of volatility or interest rate hikes. It can be an excellent tool for wealth building—but only if it fits your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. If you’re nearing retirement, seeking income, or prioritizing sector diversification, QQQ may not be for you. Instead, look toward more balanced, conservative ETFs that better match your objectives. Bottom Line: Know your financial goals, understand your risk appetite, and choose investments that align with both. QQQ is not inherently bad it’s just not for everyone.

Title: AI kingpin Nvidia crowned as first public company with a $4 trillion valuation
URL: https://www.wsbtv.com/news/ai-kingpin-nvidia/U4HZMQ2ZOVAF5BJ2TCVOKQR2Q4/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T20:45:49Z

WSB Now SAN FRANCISCO — (AP) — Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia on Wednesday became the first publicly traded company to surpass a $4 trillion market valuation, putting the latest exclamation point on the investor frenzy surrounding an artificial intelligence boom powered by its industry-leading processors. Although Nvidia's market value dipped back below $4 trillion by the time the stock market closed, reaching the milestone highlighted the upheaval being unleashed by an AI craze that's widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since Apple co—founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago. Underscoring the changing of the guard, AI bellwether Nvidia is now worth $900 billion more than Apple, which rode the iPhone's success to become the first publicly traded company to valued at $1 trillion, $2 trillion and eventually, $3 trillion. Nvidia's rise as come as Apple has struggled to deliver on its ambitions to infuse the iPhone and other products with more AI with an array of new features that included a more than year-old promise to smarten up its often bumbling virtual assistant Apple acknowledged last month that delivering on its AI vision is going to take until at least next year, leading some industry analysts to wonder if the company will have to acquire an AI start-up to regain momentum. In the meantime, former Apple design guru Jony Ive has joined forces with OpenAI to work on a wearable AI device that could challenge the iPhone while Nvidia has been scrambling to meet the feverish demand for its specialized chips that power the energy-intensive data centers underlying artificial intelligence. And tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are upping the AI ante too, collectively budgeting about $325 billion for investments in the technology this year — with a significant amount of that money likely to flow into Nvidia's coffers. The ravenous appetite for Nvidia's chips are the main reason that the company's stock price increased by 10-fold since early 2023, catapulting its market value from about $400 billion to $4 trillion. After exceeding $4 trillion for the first time early Wednesday, Nvidia's shares backtracked below that threshold at their closing price of $162.88. But most analysts don't expect the price to stay below $163 for long. In a sign of the pervasive optimism surrounding Nvidia, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino on Wednesday issued a research note predicting the stock will climb to $196 within the next year to push the company's market value to $4.8 trillion. Nvidia's rapid rise also has anointed the company's founder and CEO Jensen Huang as “the godfather” of AI, whose dissertations about the technology's direction attract enraptured audiences. Huang's widening fame also has been accompanied by a fattening fortune, now estimated at $142 billion. It looked like Nvidia may have hit a road block in early April when President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs and triggered widespread selloff in the stock market that hit the tech sector especially hard. At its nadir, Nvidia's stock price slipped below $87. But Nvidia quickly bounced and in late May delivered another stellar quarter, highlighted by an $18.8 billion profit, despite a $4.5 billion hit to account for U.S. government restrictions on the sale of some of its chips to China. The Santa Clara, California, company is scheduled to release its next quarterly report on Aug. 27. . Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Some of you may remember that Nvidia posted a very strong quarter in its Q1 FY2026 results. The company raked in $44.1 billion in revenue, which was a 69% increase from the same quarter last year and a 12% bump over the previous quarter. Nvidia has forecasted an even stronger quarter in Q2 FY2026, with revenue figures expected to be at the $45 billion mark. However, ahead of that actually happening, the firm has hit a pretty major milestone. Nvidia has become the first company in the world to achieve a market capitalization of $4 trillion after the company's stock price rose by over 2% today, as noted by CNBC. The company has surpassed both Apple and Microsoft in reaching this milestone, which is a major feat considering that both companies hit the $3 trillion market cap ahead of Nvidia. Microsoft is currently valued at $3.7 trillion, Apple is at $3.1 trillion, Alphabet (Google's parent company) is sitting comfortably at $2.1 trillion, and Meta is holding strong at $1.8 trillion. Nvidia's market cap has been boosted by strong demand for its specialized and general purpose hardware during this age of generative AI. The chipmaker really hit its stride after the meteoric growth in popularity of ChatGPT in late 2022. In addition, many companies - like Microsoft - which offer public cloud platforms to their customers rely on Nvidia's hardware for various workloads. That said, Nvidia has faced its fair share of challenges too. A recent U.S. government restriction requires it to utilize new licenses to export H20 products to China, which is expected to cost the firm $8 billion in lost sales. Notably, the $45 billion revenue estimate that Nvidia shared for the current quarter already accounts for this loss, which means that its revenue would have been above $50 billion otherwise. It will be interesting to see if other tech firms are able to catch up to Nvidia or if the chipmaker will continue sailing out of reach.

Business A NVIDIA logo is pictured on its facility at the High-tech park at Yokne'am, in northern Israel Jul 9, 2025. (Photo: REUTERS/Shir Torem) NEW YORK: The stunning rise of Nvidia to become the first publicly traded company valued at US$4 trillion underscores the massive importance to the stock market of the AI chipmaker and the technology sector. Reaching the lofty milestone caps a massive run for Nvidia's stock price, which has soared some 1,350 per cent since October 2022. This year, the chipmaker's shares are up about 22 per cent against a 6 per cent rise for the S&P 500. The company's market value hit US$4 trillion in morning trading on Wednesday (Jul 9), about 13 months after it had first reached the US$3 trillion milestone.

The stock has an even greater presence in more tech-heavy measures, such as the popular Invesco QQQ Trust ETF and the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index. Its influence is less significant in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is weighted by stock prices as opposed to market values. Nvidia may soon have company in the exclusive US$4 trillion club. Microsoft's market value was hovering around US$3.7 trillion on Wednesday. Apple ranks third at about US$3.1 trillion. Their massive market values also illustrate the hefty influence of tech and tech-related companies. The top seven S&P 500 weights, which also include Amazon.com, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Broadcom, comprise about one-third of the index. Nvidia's gains also point to the increasing presence of the overall technology sector, which is by far the largest sector in the S&P 500.

Title: How Much Is $4 Trillion? Here Are Some Ways To Think About Nvidia's Market Cap Milestone

Nvidia (NVDA) briefly surpassed a record market capitalization of $4 trillion on Wednesday morning, an amount of money that could buy you pretty much anything. The tech titan's market value is comparable to some of the largest economies in the world, as a $4 trillion gross domestic product is roughly what was produced in 2024 by Japan and India, per the World Bank, trailing only the U.S., China, and Germany. Here's a rundown of some measures of what the artificial intelligence chipmaking giant is now worth. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has become the richest person in the world thanks to his stake in Tesla, where he was an early investor, along with other companies he has helped start or acquire, like SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and X. As part of that wealth exists in the form of shares in Tesla, the billionaire's net worth can vary on a daily basis as the electric vehicle company's stock price moves. The Forbes billionaires list on Wednesday puts Musk's net worth just shy of $400 billion, still at least $100 billion more than Oracle (ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison, Meta Platforms (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, or Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, but only about 10% of Nvidia's current value. Based on the current market caps of the just over 500 stocks that make up the landmark index (to account for companies like Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) with multiple share classes, Nvidia's current value could buy nearly half of the index. Starting from the least valuable with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at about $5.5 billion and working up, Nvidia's $4 trillion market cap is worth as much as the bottom 216 companies in the S&P 500, according to Investopedia's calculations. That group includes such household names as General Mills (GIS), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Domino's Pizza (DPZ), and Best Buy (BBY). In its annual ranking of the most valuable sports franchises in the world, Forbes last December estimated that the top 50 teams globally across the NFL, MLB, NBA, and professional soccer were worth a combined $289 billion. That means that at Nvidia's current market cap, it could acquire the 50 most valuable and popular sports teams including the Dallas Cowboys, New York Yankees, and Real Madrid nearly 14 times. In its most recent valuation after the 2023 season, Forbes pegged the value of all 10 teams on the current Formula One racing grid at about $19 billion, meaning Nvidia could afford to buy the racing series more than 200 times. In March 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the company's then-recently announced Blackwell chip, designed for the heavy workloads of running and training AI models, would cost between $30,000 and $40,000 each, estimating that about $10 billion of R&D costs went into the chip. That means Nvidia's market cap could buy between 100 million and 133 million of its own chips. For comparison, Elon Musk's xAI startup, which makes the Grok chatbot that is used on the social media site X, has installed about 200,000 chips from Nvidia to train and run the product.

Title: The 15 best deals from Walmart's big Prime Day rival sale
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/deals/best-walmart-deals-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-07-09T18:47:58Z
Full Content:
Prime Day is ending tonight, but you can rest easy knowing there are still plenty of deals to shop in the days after Amazon's event wraps up. Walmart is running a massive competing sale until Sunday, and we've gathered the best Walmart deals rivaling those of Prime Day, below. Some of the best Walmart deals this year are on tech products, with prices matching many Amazon Prime Day discounts. Apple is particularly strong, with $120 off the new iPad Air and a 30% discount on the Apple Watch Series 10 42mm. But if you're looking to beat Amazon prices, home and kitchen is the way to go. The 21-piece beige Carote nonstick cookware set is just $100 at Walmart, while an incredibly similar cream white set is just over $123 for Prime Day. Deals are going fast, too. At $100 off, the Blackstone ProSeries 2-burner is sold out for shipping and delivery (although you can always try finding one for pickup at a nearby store). While the sale lasts through July 13, we recommend buying sooner rather than later if you see something you're interested in, since items often go out of stock. You can explore more sales in our best Prime Day deals hub and our guide to the best Prime Day competing sales. Apple is a popular category this year from Walmart, with iPads, AirPods, Apple Watches, and more down to all-time lows. These prices are just as low as Amazon's during Prime Day, making now a good time to buy. The new M3 iPad Air models include an upgraded processor and added video editing features over last year's models. Otherwise, they offer the same design and features as their predecessors in the same 11-inch and 13-inch form factors. The AirPods Pro 2 are a big upgrade from their predecessors, with improved noise cancellation and battery life. They also support new aural health features to assess your hearing and function as hearing aids. This model comes with a USB-C charging case and added dust resistance. The 11th-generation iPad largely mirrors the 10th-generation iPad from 2022, apart from its upgraded A16 chip and increased storage. It lacks Apple Intelligence, but it's the cheapest option in the brand's lineup and more than enough for most users. The MacBook Air released in late 2020 with Apple's M1 processor brings impressively fast performance and long battery life for $649, making it among the best Apple laptops overall considering its price. The 44mm Apple Watch SE is simply a larger model than the 40mm SE, and is otherwise identical. The Apple Watch SE is the perfect blend of features and affordability. The Apple Watch Series 10 is thinner than its predecessors, with larger display sizes and cases (including a new titanium option). It runs on the latest S10 processor and has a wide-angle OLED display for easier reading at an angle, faster charging, and media playback from its speakers. Apple's handy tracking device comes bundled in a discounted four-pack. Airtags are easy to set up and allow you to track multiple items in the Find My app alongside your friends and devices. The Apple Pencil (USB-C) is compatible with any iPad that has a USB-C port. These days, that's any iPad Apple sells today. It charges via USB-C, but it can still attach magnetically to your iPad. It's a little more basic than the 2nd-gen Apple Pencil, but it does support Apple's Hover feature for the iPad Pros. When it comes to tech, Walmart loves to compete with Amazon's low Prime Day pricing by matching deals for TVs, gaming, and more. These deals are as good, if not better, than what Prime members can score this week. The Linkbuds Fit are good earbuds for various workouts, but we found their design to be especially good for bike riding since they don't stick out and mess with helmet straps. The Beats Studio Pro are wireless headphones designed to do it all, whether you want to be fully immersed in an album or take a call on the go. They offer both active noise canceling (ANC) and transparency modes, making them a versatile option for any situation. This Roku Smart TV lets you stream all of your favorite apps with 4K resolution and an enhanced voice remote. The 50-inch Vizio MQX is a budget-friendly QLED built with gaming in mind. It has a higher refresh rate than most competing sets this size, which can offer smoother gameplay when paired with a PS5, Xbox Series X, or PC. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game and three months of Meta Quest+ (combined $70 value). Coffee makers, vacuum cleaners, and other home goods are popular products to find on sale during Prime Day, so Walmart is meeting the heat by dropping prices just as low as Amazon. Brands like Bissell, Dyson, Keurig, and KitchenAid are all available now. Carpet and upholstery cleaners can often be large, bulky contraptions that clutter busy closet floor space. So, the portable Bissell Little Green cleaner is a great option for small spaces like apartments, tiny houses, and condos because it's small enough to fit in cupboards, on shelves, or potentially even under your sink. Coffee is a serious necessity for some, and the AeroPress is small, simple, portable, and easy-to-use way to brew a highly competitive, frothy cup of coffee somewhere between a French press and an espresso. This mixer packs a punch with a large stainless steel bowl meant for mixing big batches of heavier foods. It comes with 11 mixing speeds and is compatible with multiple attachments. Whether you're looking for a frying pan, a large pot, or something to stir and flip with, Carote's massive selection of nonstick cookware can help build out a kitchen. This Keurig takes the signature brewer to a new level with app compatibility so you can customize and schedule your brew. Plus, you can choose from five strength settings and six temperature settings. This corded electric Dyson is self-righting and comes with four other tools in addition to the Turbinehead to get maximum coverage on different surfaces. The Dyson V12 Detect Slim Cordless Stick Vacuum is a lightweight cleaning solution that balances battery run time and suction. The chair comes with three accent pillows and rotates on a 360-degree swivel base. This traditional kit comes with 20 treatments of whitening strips, with the goal of getting teeth 18 levels whiter within 20 days. The Sonic-Fusion combines an electric toothbrush and a Waterpik to score double the power of traditional brushing and flossing on getting rid of plaque and keeping gums healthy. This device is accepted by the American Dental Association. With the Schick Intuition Sensitive Care razor, there's no need for a separate can of shaving gel because it's built right into the razor cartridge. The AncestryDNA + Traits kit gives you all of the same information as you get from the above kit plus over 25 of your most interesting traits as determined by your genetics so you can learn about where your characteristics came from. Walmart Plus is an entire membership program designed to benefit regular shoppers at Walmart. It gets you free delivery on groceries from your local store with no minimum spend, fuel discounts, and other promo offers throughout the year. In an answer to Amazon's Prime Video bonus, you also get a free Paramount+ subscription packed with TV and movie content. While Walmart Plus subscribers got early access to Walmart's deals this week, you don't need to be a member to shop the sale now. Unlike Prime Day, the sales are for anyone and don't require any form of membership. Walmart Plus subscriptions offer more than just shopping perks. Like Amazon Prime, memberships unlock an impressive suite of benefits, including access to Paramount Plus Essential, free online pet care through Pawp, Burger King savings opportunities, and more. Most notably, memberships come with free shipping (no order minimum) and free delivery ($35 minimum) from your local store. You can learn more on the Walmart Plus membership page. The grand Walmart or Amazon debate is totally dependent on you and your needs. You can learn more about the two services and their respective perks in our Amazon Prime vs. Walmart Plus guide, where we note that while the memberships offer different value, Prime Day deals tend to be a bit better when it comes to variety and value.

By Blair Marnell on July 9, 2025 at 11:11AM PDT GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. After massive layoffs across Microsoft and its gaming studios, there hasn't been a lot of good news for the Xbox team. It's small comfort to those who lost their jobs, but Microsoft had a dominant month in May 2025 with four out of the top five best-selling games in the US. Circana has shared its report for video games sold in May, and the only game in the top five that wasn't published by Microsoft was Elden Ring Nightreign, which debuted on the list at No. 1. Doom: The Dark Ages had a strong debut at No. 2 for Microsoft and Bethesda, with Forza Horizon 5, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 rounding out the top 5. These cross-platform releases on PS5 have apparently made a sizable impact. Microsoft's perennial best-seller, Minecraft, slipped to the seventh slot in May. The only other new additions to chart in May were EA's F1 25 at No. 15, and Capcom Fighting Collection 2 at No. 19. Most of the other titles have been placing in the top 20 for months, although Star Wars Battlefront 2 made a surprising leap from No.135 to No. 12 in just a single month as fans continue to make the case for Star Wars Battlefront 3. You can find the complete roundup of the best-selling games in the US for May 2025 below. Afterwards, you can check out the updated list of the best-selling games of 2025.

These stories are edited by Fortune's senior business editors to verify the accuracy of the information before publishing. Nvidia made history by becoming the world’s first publicly traded company to surpass a $4 trillion market capitalization. The milestone was reached as Nvidia’s stock price surged to $164.42 during intraday trading on July 9. The company’s stock has soared by approximately 1,460% over the past five years, with a near 18% gain registered year-to-date. Nvidia’s ascent is driven by its near-monopoly on AI chip manufacturing, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) forming the backbone of machine learning, data centers, and large language models. The Silicon Valley giant’s chips are now essential for tech giants including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet. Nvidia’s historic rally has had a dramatic impact on the personal fortune of its co-founder and CEO, Jensen Huang. As of July 2025, Huang’s net worth is estimated by Bloomberg at $140 billion, up $25 billion this year alone. Huang owns about 3.5% of Nvidia, making him the largest individual shareholder. This surge places Huang among the world’s 10 richest individuals, with his fortune closely tracking Nvidia’s stock performance. Nvidia now holds the heaviest weighting on the S&P 500 index, surpassing tech giants Apple and Microsoft. The milestone has fueled optimism for further growth, with some analysts projecting Nvidia’s market cap to keep rising. Loop Capital’s Ananda Baruah sees Nvidia at the “front-end” of the next “Golden Wave” for generative AI pushing it past $6 trillion in coming years.

Title: Microsoft Isn't in the '$4 Trillion Club'—Yet

Microsoft won't be the first company to see its market cap touch $4 trillion—but its shares still have plenty of room to rise, one analyst said. Oppenheimer cited growth in Microsoft's (MSFT) AI revenue among its reasons on Wednesday to upgrade the software giant's shares to a bullish "outperform" rating. It set a $600 price target that is well above Visible Alpha's average of just over $548 and one of a few that is $5 below the highest one out there. The target represents about a 20% premium to Tuesday's close; the shares were recently up nearly 1% to nearly $501, perhaps on track for their first close above $500 apiece. (You can read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) The company's market cap is around $3.7 trillion today, according to Visible Alpha data. Growing AI revenue offers "not only valuation support ... but also upside potential as this revenue stream continues scaling fast and investors embrace Microsoft as one of the long-term AI winners in software," Oppenheimer wrote. The analysts also said Microsoft was one of "only a few vendors in the software industry" capable of a so-called "Rule of 60" profile, a reference to the concept of a company having a combined annual revenue growth rate and EBITDA margin above 60. That, they said, "lends good support to premium multiples" for Microsoft's stock. Microsoft is one of only three companies with a market cap above $3 trillion. Nvidia (NVDA) this morning became the first to top $4 trillion; Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note earlier today said he figures Microsoft will get there "this summer." Apple (AAPL) has a market cap of about $3.1 trillion.

U.S. equities were higher but little changed at midday as the market continued to focus on what effect new Trump administration tariffs will have on the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were up. Nvidia (NVDA) became the first company ever to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization as demand for its artificial intelligence chips keeps growing. AES (AES) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 on a report the renewable energy provider is exploring a possible sale. Shares of Merck (MRK) and U.S.-listed shares of Verona Pharma (VRNA) gained when Merck said it would pay about $10 billion for the British firm, adding to its portfolio of respiratory disease treatments. U.S.-listed shares of WPP (WPP) plunged when the big advertising firm slashed its guidance and warned that clients were pulling back spending because of macroeconomic uncertainty. Shares of Vertical Aerospace (EVTL) sank after the maker of battery-powered aircraft announced it would be selling $60 million worth of shares at $5.00 each, 28% below yesterday's closing price. Shares of Hershey (HSY) and Wendy's (WEN) fell when Wendy's chief executive Kirk Tanner resigned and took over as Hershey's new CEO. Oil futures rose. Gold futures were little changed. Copper prices tumbled as Trump slapped big new tariffs on imports of the metal. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was down. The U.S. dollar gained on the euro and pound, but lost ground to the yen. Major cryptocurrencies traded higher. TradingView

Title: Why Coca-Cola’s CIO prioritizes big-impact AI pilot projects
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/09/why-coca-colas-cio-prioritizes-big-impact-ai-pilot-projects/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T15:15:32Z
Full Content:
John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Neeraj Tolmare, the chief information officer at Coca-Cola, says the artificial intelligence pilots that he invests in only get authorized if the beverage giant can envision revenue generation or big efficiency gains once fully in production. This strategy reflects a mandate from Coke’s CEO James Quincey and the broader leadership team that demands that AI experimentation “has to be tied to a real outcome that moves the needle for us,” says Tolmare. “We are all about scale.” That scale is massive for Coca-Cola, which is ranked 97th on the Fortune 500. Each AI bet by Tolmare has to weigh cost of implementation, as well as how the technology may be used internally across various functions ranging from software development to sales. On top of that, he must weigh how new technology advancements like agentic AI will change workflows and how data is shared within Coke and close key external partners, including the 200 bottlers and 950 production facilities that make up the entire system that Coke relies on to serve 2.2 billion beverages each day. One pilot that Tolmare is particularly excited about is the development of an algorithm that Coke developed to help retail outlets better predict demand, using AI to ensure that their shelves are always appropriately stocked. In the past, sales agents would visit stores every few weeks and at times, find themselves facing half-empty coolers. Coke had to rely on historical retail scan data to try to anticipate future demand. But with AI, the company was able to create an algorithm that triangulates historical data with weather patterns, which is an important consideration for beverage purchases, and geolocation data from Google to more precisely predict future sales. Those AI insights inform the messages Coca-Cola sends via WhatsApp to managers, advising them on when to stock more Sprite or Diet Coke before they run out. The pilot was tested in three countries and saw sales increase by 7% to 8% versus outlets that weren’t using the AI algorithm, according to Tolmare, who intends to broaden the application of this AI tool to more markets globally. Another investment with big reach is Coke’s usage of AI for content creation. The beverage giant sells in more than 180 countries and creates marketing assets in over 130 languages. It’s a process that’s both time consuming and costly, because Coke has to adjust the materials to reflect not only language, but also cultural sensibilities. Coke recently created 20 AI-generated assets, all based on the company’s own proprietary intellectual property, and then created 10,000 variations to be used across many different languages and geographies. Tolmare asserts that consumers are 20% more likely to engage with this content than prior iterations that weren’t crafted by AI, and that the AI-produced content was three times faster to generate. In both cases, he stresses the importance of keeping humans in the loop. “AI has proven that it can unlock value that a human being would not be able to unlock because the computation needed to mine through all this data and bring something meaningful is so complex,” says Tolmare, in regards to the algorithm to support retail sales. With marketing, AI’s application is a bit trickier and Coke is still figuring out the right approach. An AI-generated Christmas spot generated some backlash last year and in April, a different campaign made a mistake featuring a quote from a book that novelist J.G. Ballard never wrote. Tolmare says Coke has strict guidelines in place to ensure that AI-generated content avoids social biases that would be harmful to consumers and is keenly aware of hallucinations or deepfakes that can occur when generating creative content with AI tools. “That’s not to say that we won’t ever fall into it,” admits Tolmare. “But we have a mechanism in place that allows us to react in a responsible way if and when that happens.” Most of Tolmare’s career has been in the technology industry, including working for gadget manufacturer Palm, which ultimately lost out on an effort to compete with Apple in the smartphone market. He also previously served as a director at networking-equipment company Cisco Systems and as a VP at HP during the years in which it split up the personal-computer and printer businesses from the corporate hardware and services arm. “I’ve spent more than two decades working for companies that develop and manufacture technology that the rest of the world uses,” says Tolmare. He joined Coca-Cola in 2018 to work at a company that consumes technology, rather than developing it, to grow their business. Tolmare spearheaded the company’s all-in bet on cloud computing, retiring or selling all of Coke’s physical data centers. Roughly 80% of the company’s footprint is in Microsoft Azure with the rest split between Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. “We continuously monitor which one is going to give us better efficiency by moving a workload from one cloud to another,” says Tolmare. His hybrid cloud playbook is also applicable to how Coke thinks about generative AI experimentation. Coke works closely with Microsoft and its strategic partner OpenAI, but also taps other AI hyperscalers including Google, Meta, and Anthropic. “We don’t want to paint ourselves into a corner too soon,” he says. “The market itself is not consolidating.” What’s next on deck is further exploration with agentic AI, systems that are designed to perform tasks autonomously or with little human intervention. The company is considering offerings from vendors including Microsoft, SAP, and Adobe, while developing its own AI agents trained on Coke’s data. All of these AI agents remain in the pilot phase, because Tolmare still wants to determine if these systems can be built at a cost effective price, while achieving the optimal business outcomes. “We haven’t launched agentic in production yet, but we are very close,” says Tolmare. “I’m fascinated by what this can do for our business.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Tech giants offer more discounts to the federal government. The Wall Street Journal reports that Oracle is cutting the cost of the company’s database software and cloud-computing service for the federal government. The discount on cloud infrastructure is the first of its kind for the entire government and could be replicated with other cloud providers in negotiations that are currently underway. Other recent price discounts that the General Services Administration were able to extract from vendors include a deal cut with Salesforce to trim the price of messaging app Slack by 90% through the end of November and lower costs from Google and Adobe. The GSA has opted to negotiate these savings through direct engagement with the tech giants, rather than discussing pricing with third parties. “Through procurement consolidation, we’re aiming to bring the leverage of the whole, commanding purchasing power of the federal wallet to these [technology providers] to get the best discounts for the taxpayers,” Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum told WSJ. Ford CEO predicts AI will replace half of U.S. white-collar workers. CEOs have increasingly shared their dour prognostication of AI’s impact on the future of work and the latest diagnosis came from Jim Farley, the CEO of automaker Ford. Speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Farley was making the case that the education system is too focused on pushing students toward a four-year college degree, which may be counterintuitive, given his view that “AI is gonna replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.” Farley makes a pitch for more investment in trade workers, those who may take a job on an auto factory floor or in construction, where there is a shortage of workers. He may have a point, as tech giants continue to slice jobs, with Microsoft earlier this month cutting another 9,000 jobs, bringing the grand total of jobs eliminated by the tech giant to 15,000 this year. But, IT unemployment dropped to its lowest level this year in June. Much of the consternation about AI's impact on work has been focused on tech jobs, especially as big employers like Microsoft and TikTok continue to generate national headlines when announcing layoffs. That said, across all sectors, businesses are on the hunt for talent and have been hiring for software developers and engineers, systems engineers and architects, and cybersecurity professionals, according to CIO Dive, which reported on insights from CompTIA. The IT trade organization reported that IT unemployment fell to 2.8% in June, as companies across all sectors added 90,000 net new tech jobs. Active employer job listings for tech positions reached 455,341 in June, with 47% of that total newly added in June. But the tech industry itself continues to be a weak point, as that sector reduced staffing by a net 7,256 positions in June. Google parent company’s AI-powered drug firm gearing up for clinical trials. Alphabet’s drug discovery arm, Isomorphic Labs, is getting close to testing AI-designed drugs in humans, Fortune reports, as company president Colin Murdoch says “the next big milestone is actually going to clinical trials, starting to put these things into human beings. We’re staffing up now. We’re getting very close.” Isomorphic Labs, which was spun out of Google’s AI research lab DeepMind in 2021, raised $600 million in April to help propel its goal of combining the expertise of machine learning researchers and pharma veterans to design new treatments at a faster pace, more cheaply, and with a higher rate of success. Isomorphic supports existing pharma drug discovery programs, having already inked research collaborations with Novartis and Eli Lilly, and also develops its own internal drug candidates in areas such as oncology and immunology. Why CIOs need to focus on both data quality and permission. A new survey found that while 52% of companies are “highly reliant” on the consented data that’s used to craft personalized marketing materials and product development, there are still roadblocks as it pertains to how enterprises use this data. That’s important to get right if enterprises want to retain trust with the consumers that authorize the use of their data, while also adhering to state laws in places like California, which has given individuals greater control over their personal information. Some big issues that CIOs face related to consent requirements include a lack of visibility into data flows (61%), followed closely by difficulty tracking user preferences across channels (59%). They’ll need to solve these problems quickly as 100% of the 265 survey respondents say that consented consumer data is foundational to their ability to succeed when it comes to pursuing AI initiatives. Kate Parker, President of Transcend, the data privacy management software provider that funded the study, tells Fortune that the findings highlight a shift in thinking that’s less focused on data quality and more about permission to use the consumer data in the first place. “If CIOs and digital leaders are in agreement that the consent of the data is the fundamental component of AI and personalization, but they also admit very openly that they do not have the infrastructure to solve that in scale, that’s going to be one of the biggest growth blockers,” says Parker.

Title: An isotopic perspective on equid selection in cult at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath, Israel

Archaeological excavations of an Early Bronze Age III (c. 2900–2600/2550 BCE) domestic neighborhood at the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath, Israel, uncovered four complete skeletons of young female donkeys that were buried immediately below house floors as ritual foundation deposits. Multi-isotope analyses (carbon, oxygen and strontium) of their teeth document that each of the donkeys was born and raised in Egypt before being brought to Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath where they were slaughtered and buried beneath house floors in a non-elite domestic neighborhood. In contrast, isotopic analysis of teeth from a single isolated donkey mandible and additional sheep and goat teeth that displayed evidence of being used for food consumption and not associated with a complete burial, identify the donkey as born and raised among local livestock in the vicinity of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath. The intentionally buried of specifically imported and highly valued young jennies reveal what appears to be a ritually charged characteristic when constructing domestic residences at the site.

The first excavated donkey (EQ1 – also known as a sacrificial ass) is a clear sacrificial foundation deposit [1]. Isotopic analyses indicated that it was born and raised in Egypt before being brought to the site where it was slaughtered [2]. The isotopic study has been completed on the three additional complete donkey burials excavated at the site in 2016 (EQ2 and EQ3) and 2017 (EQ4). For comparative purposes, isotopic analyses were also conducted on a loose equid mandible that was recovered in 2017 (EQ21), as well as on livestock (sheep and goat) specimens from the same deposits at the site. In addition, bioavailable strontium from the surroundings of the site were also analyzed. The results presented here confirm exchange connections between Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath and Old Kingdom Egypt as proposed by the isotopic data from EQ1. They further reveal a decision to sacrifice young and healthy female animals, those exclusively imported from Egypt. The archaeological site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath (modern Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi; ancient Gath) is in central Israel about 20 km from the Mediterranean coast on the southern bank of the Elah Valley. It is located on top of a natural limestone outcrop at the westernmost edge of the Judean Foothills (Shephelah in Hebrew) and overlooks the modern southern Coastal Plain of Israel [3] (Fig 1). This location allowed access to fresh water and exploitation of a rich variety and abundance of natural food resources from both the rolling foothills and coastal plain [4–7]. The site is positioned along or near several major transportation routes that transect the locality to regions to the north, south, east and west. These include the north-south “Trough Valley” along the base of the Judean Mountains to the east of the site; the north-south road along the coastal plain to the west of the site; and the east-west route that extends from the coast to the Judean highlands through the Elah Valley) [8,9]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g001 During the Early Bronze Age III (c. 2900–2600/2550 BCE), the site reaches urban proportions typical for this region (c. 24 ha in size) (Fig 2) and becomes one of the largest and most important of Early Bronze urban centers in the southern Levant [10–15]. It is surrounded by a thick and tall stone-based fortification system [16–24]. As a result of systematic surface collection and excavation, there is now evidence for an extensive Early Bronze (EB) occupation across the entire tell (or mound) [12,15]. Excavation areas are labeled by letters and Area E is in bold. Excavation areas are labeled by letters and Area E is in bold. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g002 Excavations conducted over the course of several seasons (2004–2017) at the eastern end of the site (Area E), uncovered part of an EB III urban residential (domestic) neighborhood [12,14]. The urban character of the site on whole during the EB III is seen through the extensive fortifications, evidence of social hierarchy and bureaucracy [25], and finds indicating economic connectivity [6,26–28] with broad regions in the Levant and beyond. In the excavation of Area E of the site, parts of several non-elite domestic residential buildings and an alleyway were intensively excavated and the remains studied (Fig 3). Three major strata of urban renewal occurred toward the end of the EB III period. In the earliest Stratum E5c (dated to the later EB III, c. 2700−2600 BCE), the buildings established in earlier strata (Strata E6-E7) are demolished and built anew. In the two subsequent strata (E5b and E5a), the buildings undergo further renovations where rooms are subdivided. After Stratum E5a, the site is abandoned/destroyed and there is no occupation in this area for more than a thousand years [29–31]. In the earliest E5c stratum, just before the walls were built, at least four donkeys were sacrificed and buried beneath the beaten earth floors of each building room. A thick (10−20 cm) layer of grey ashy soil accumulated above the floors during the occupation before the next strata of renewal occurred (E5b and a) [1,32–34]. Two radiocarbon contexts from Stratum E5c were measured from Building 134307, in which EQ1 was buried. The modeled 68.3% results range between 2870−2670 BCE for layer E5c, with three to four more likely ranges of years within those 200 years of probability distributions. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g003 Four of the donkey specimens (EQ1–4) are from Stratum E5c and are completely articulated skeletons found buried beneath the earthen floor of the courtyards, at the layers of the floor infrastructure, in two large buildings on either side of the alleyway (Fig 3 and Fig 4a, b, c, d; Supplementary S1 Table). Each of the donkeys is buried in shallow pits about 20–30 cm beneath the floors in the time just before the floors were laid down as the neighborhood is being renewed. There is no evidence that they are later intrusions since they are sealed by the Stratum E5c dirt floor. All the burial pits were found without any other finds, only the equid skeletons. This contrasts with the rest of the infrastructure layers, where non-indicative pottery was found. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g004 One skeleton lies below the floor of Building 134307 (EQ1), while three lie below the floor of Building 17E82D08 across the alley (EQ2–4). In EQ1, the front and hind legs were tied together (trussed) below the abdomen, and the upper neck (cervical) vertebra and cranium were dismembered. It is evident that the animal was sacrificed as the head is fully cut off and carefully placed on the abdomen facing in the opposite direction [1]. The head rests on its left side. The three other complete skeletons are found across the alleyway buried beneath Courtyard 17E82D08 of Building 17E82D08. They also lie on their left sides, but without any clear evidence of dismemberment. Their legs also appear to have been trussed, as the feet are brought close together or overlap beneath their abdomens. While there are no artefacts associated with these interments, the deposits are ritual interments [1,9], with each of the skeletons carefully laid out in the same manner. Each is placed in a separate pit with the head facing east (possibly toward the rising sun) [33]. Further, all are either old subadults or young adults and healthy females who were killed in the prime of their lives. Fragments of donkey figurine and zoomorphic vessel carrying loads were also found in Stratum E5a. That the skulls of all four donkeys face eastwards, as well as their similar age and sex, suggests a cultic/ritual choice. Such an eastern orientation of skeletal remains is similar to preferences seen in Anatolia [35] and elsewhere in the southern Levant [36]. In contrast, EQ21 (Stratum E7) is the only incomplete skeleton discussed here (L20E93A12; B20E93A139). It is represented by an isolated mandible with teeth (LPM2–4 and M1-3, but M3 is only visible in the crypt). It was found in the collapse of a Stratum E7 building amidst a concentration of stones (L20E93A11) likely representing a floor in Stratum E7. It was selected for comparison with the four donkey burials as it was an example of an equid consumed, and its remains discarded afterwards. In addition, isotopic analysis for several sheep and goat specimens from the same horizons and bioavailable strontium specimens from surroundings of the site were also included to form a regional isoscape and baseline for comparison with the donkey remains. Each of these are discussed below to interpret the four donkeys ritually buried beneath the floors of buildings as the neighborhood is being renewed. Isotope signatures are incorporated into animal tissues and are stored for variable periods of time, depending on the turnover rate of the different tissues. As tooth enamel does not turnover once formed, [37] isotopic analysis provides a picture of the animal’s diet, seasonality and/or mobility at the time of formation. Hoppe et al. [38] utilized radiographic and optical analyses to determine the timing of tooth enamel biomineralization in horses. Their results indicate that the Molar 1 (M1) begins to mineralize around two weeks of age and continues to mineralize for approximately one year after eruption (occurring between 8 months and one year). As such, the first molar records isotopic signatures of diet and mobility up to approximately two years of age. The second molar (LM2) begins to mineralize before eruption at approximately six months of age, the tooth erupts between 20–26 months and will continue to mineralize for an additional 30 months. Mineralization of molar 3 (M3) starts when M1 and M2 erupt (~6–8 months), while M3 erupts between 3.5 and 4 years. The intra-tooth sampling of teeth utilized here will reveal information on shifts in diet (carbon), water (oxygen) and mobility (strontium) from birth to approximately five years of age. As each equid is aged through tooth eruption and wear and epiphyseal fusion at approximately five years of age1 this sampling strategy documents their entire lifespan. The use of stable carbon isotopes to reconstruct diet is well-established in archaeology. Terrestrial plants in the southern Levant can be divided into two groups (C3, C4) based on their differential means of fixing atmospheric CO2. These differential mechanisms result in distinct δ13C values. These differences in the δ13C values of the plants consumed are reflected in the tissues of the animals that consume them [39–41]. While C3 vegetation is dominant in Mediterranean climate zones [42], C4 grasses are also part of the flora of Mediterranean regions [43] and their abundance increases in steppe and desert environments [44]. Oxygen isotope composition in the tooth enamel in mammals is linked to the isotopic composition of environmental water they consume [45,46]. As the isotopic composition of the water is correlated with temperature and evapotranspiration, it will vary seasonally. In mid- to high- latitudes the lowest δ18O values are seen in the coldest months and the highest δ18O values during the summer months [47]. Strontium isotopes are useful as biogeochemical tracers in the study of mobility as they are characteristic of the local geology [48]. Strontium 87Sr/86Sr ratios vary locally with changes in local bedrock geology, bedrock weathering, and the contribution of atmospheric dust [49]. Soil and plants are in isotopic equilibrium with local soils and share similar isotopic ratios for bioavailable strontium. Animals consuming these plants incorporate strontium in the mineral structure of bones and teeth as calcium substitutes during tissue formation. Measurement of the strontium ratio will provide a measure of the relative importance of foods from areas of variable lithologies [50]. As a result, migration studies should utilize biologically available strontium rather than only substrate geology. Plants, soil, rodents and/or invertebrates may be collected for this purpose. Isotope results are presented in Fig 5 and 6 and in Supplementary S2 and S3 Tables. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.t001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g006 EQ2, EQ3, and EQ4 (n = 9 molars; 82 samples) have mean carbon isotope values of −2.7‰ and ranges from −7.5‰ to 0.7‰ (S2 Table, Fig 5) while EQ21 (n = 3 molars; 37 samples) has a = −10.5‰ and a range between −11.2‰ to −9.8‰ (Fig 6). These values suggest that EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 were eating vegetation from a mixed C3/C4 environment with a high proportion of C4 vegetation as was seen with EQ1 [2]. EQ21’s carbon values show a diet of >90% C3 from all molar samples, which indicates the dominance of C3 vegetation in the diet, matching the diet of previously sampled caprines (abbreviated OC for Ovis/Capra including both sheep and goat) [51]. EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 (n = 9 teeth, 81 samples) have average strontium ratios of 0.70824, and ranges of 0.70813 to 0.70833 (S3 Table, Fig 5). There are obvious similarities to the strontium ratios of the first and second molars of EQ1. EQ21 (n = 3 teeth; 40 samples) has an average of 0.70839, and ranges between 0.70836 to 0.70844 (Fig 6). The mean δ18O values for EQ2, EQ3, and EQ4 (n = 9 teeth; 82 samples) = 0.96‰ and values range between −1.6 -to 2.6‰ (S2 Table, Fig 5). Modern oxygen isotope values for the Nile River before the construction of Aswan Dam provide an average δ18O (VSMOW) of 0.74‰ and measured in shallow groundwater reservoirs [52]. These values align with the mean oxygen isotope values for Egyptian archaeological human tooth and bone carbonate values analyzed at different locations along the Nile valley (1.05 ± 1.02‰) [53]. The seasonal fluctuation in the δ18O values of sacrificial donkeys EQ2, EQ3, and EQ4, record short negative spikes (~−1‰ relative to adjacent samples and marked by green shaded areas in Fig 5). These correspond to summer season incorporation of Blue Nile water from the Ethiopian highland with measured [55]. Calculating the mean δ18O values of all the molar teeth of EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 excluding the negative pulses highlights the significance of these shifts. The average of EQ2 molars minus the two negative samples at 6.4 mm and 34 mm (n = 30) is 0.8 ± 0.56‰ (1 std. dev.) vs. 0.95‰, the mean of the two negative pulses, a difference more than two standard deviations lower than the average. This pattern is repeated in EQ3 (n = 22; 1.2 + 0.8‰ vs. −0.5‰) and EQ4 (n = 22; 0.7 + 0.4‰ vs. −0.4‰). The oxygen isotope values for EQ21 are more negative = −2.3‰ than those of the donkeys (2 tail t-test assuming equal variance p > 0.00001) and range between −0.1 to −3.5‰ (Fig 6). EQ21 values agree with oxygen isotope values measured in caprines from Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath [51] and correspond to mean modern δ18O values of rainfall of the southern Levant in proximity to the site between −3.5– (−5)‰ (VSMOW) [54]. The statistical procedure PROC DISTANCE in SAS was used to assess all of the isotope data (carbon, oxygen and strontium) currently available from Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath (EQ1 [2]; all caprines [51]) and the three additional equids (EQ2, EQ3, EQ4 and EQ21) discussed here. The DISTANCE procedure computes measures of dissimilarity or similarity between the observations. The output data set was then used as input to the MDS procedures. The MDS PROC performed multidimensional scaling to create Dimensions 1–4 (see Supplementary S4 Table). Dimensions 3 and 4 are all near zero and are redundant. As such, only Dimensions 1 and 2 are graphed (Fig 7). The unique pattern of OC#3 is highlighted. Arrows indicate the final three samples of the third molar of EQ1. The unique pattern of OC#3 is highlighted. Arrows indicate the final three samples of the third molar of EQ1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g007 Previous isotopic analyses of EQ1 utilized carbon, oxygen and strontium isotopic proxies as evidence that this individual was born and lived in the Nile Valley prior to travel and eventual sacrifice at the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath [2]. EQ1 completed its early tooth development in the Nile Valley and later migrated to Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath where it completed the formation of its third molar. The three samples closest to the root/enamel junction (REJ) are the last to mineralize and reflect the shift in diet, water source and local geology (highlighted with arrows in Fig 7). This corroborates textual and other archaeological information that already pointed toward the existence of long-distance trade of donkey caravans between Egypt and Canaan during this early urban period. The analyses of four additional equids (from 3 burials and a single loose mandible) presented here provides additional direct evidence for the import of equids from Egypt to the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath. While all four burials point to an Egyptian origin, the single loose mandible isotopic signature suggests a local origin from around the site. This is mirrored by the results of the other domestic livestock and bioavailable strontium analyses. While a single caprine was also identified as having an Egyptian origin, all the other caprines sampled (n = 16) reflect discrete values that indicate their life history was focused locally at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath [2,51]. The primary indicator for Nile Valley origins of EQ1–4 is the dominance of C4 vegetation (>50%) in their diet, as indicated by the δ13C carbonate values measured in the early tooth formation of the EQ1 (M1 + M2) and in all three molar teeth of EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 (Fig 5). As has been previously asserted [1] the Nile Valley is the nearest geographic location where C4 vegetation can serve as primary fodder for herbivores [55,56]. Seasonal shifts in carbon isotope values can be associated with agricultural cycles in the Nile Valley. C4 plants are not the sole forage or fodder source in Egypt but serve as a good food source for livestock. It is evident that on a seasonal basis donkeys might eat more C3 plants (by-products of agricultural production). The expected pattern of change in carbon isotopes for an animal moving from the Nile River Valley to the interior of the southern Levant would be a shift from a C4 plant dominant diet to a predominant C3 diet (Fig 8). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g008 This pattern is reflected in all equids showing a greater C3 contribution to the diet in their third molars. In contrast, the δ13C values of the sampled caprines predominantly reflect the C3 vegetation that dominates the Mediterranean climate with only a minor contribution of C4 vegetation [51]. EQ21’s carbon values show a diet of >90% C3 from all molar samples which indicates the dominance of C3 vegetation in the diet (Fig 6). EQ1 δ18O values match archaeological human tooth and bone carbonate values that were analyzed at different locations along the Nile valley (+1.05 ± 1.02‰)54 and the same is true for EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4. In addition, the oxygen isotopes of EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 provide an important secondary marker for Egyptian origin with the observation of the Blue Nile negative oxygen isotope pulses along the teeth. Sequential sampling along first and second molars display a negative dip (~1‰) of oxygen isotope values at around 33−43 mm from the root-enamel-junction (REJ) that is congruent with seasonal flow of tributary water into the Nile River. These low points are associated with late summer flooding caused by the Blue Nile input. The flow of monsoon water from the highlands of Ethiopia into the Blue Nile occurs during late summer months and provides a pulse of 18O depleted water that dominate premodern Nile volume (85% of Nile flow) and composition [57,58]. The summer main rainy season mean oxygen isotope composition of the Blue Nile from the highlands of Ethiopia is −2.3‰ [57]. The intensity of Blue Nile water flow varies between years in agreement with ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) [59]. It is therefore unsurprising to see variability in the expression of Blue Nile signal within and between individuals. Further, a second negative dip in the oxygen isotope values is suggested by trends in the final samples of the teeth indicating a complete seasonal cycle. In contrast, the oxygen isotope values for EQ21 are more negative = −2.3‰ and match the δ18O values in caprine (OC) teeth studied at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath [51]. Values vary between 0 – (−2) ‰ (n = 13, and are comparable to prehistoric gazelles originating in low topographies of the eastern Galilee and much higher than the negative values measured in high topography gazelles [60]. This pattern suggests that the EB caprine herds, and EQ21 were herded eastwards from the site to the lower reaches of the Judean Mountains. Even though the Judean Mountains elevation reaches ~1000 m above modern sea level, there is no indication that they were herded into the higher reaches of the Judean Mountains since their isotopic values are comparable to the gazelle’s low topographies values. Arnold et al. [2] detail plant collection strategy and results that allowed creation of a local isoscape surrounding the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath. There is an 87Sr/86 Sr range of 0.7084–0.7085 for the rendzina soils that cover the area east of the site. This hilly region is very suitable for the herding of both grazers (sheep) and browsers (goats), while the flatter dark brown alluvium vertisol soils located west of the site that extend to the seashore are more suitable for rainfed cereal agriculture [61]. Plant sampling also took place on Holocene alluvium soils (vertisols) to the west of the site. However, this sampling cannot provide a credible estimate for all alluvial soils as alluvium strontium ratios vary depending on parent bedrock weathering and atmospheric deposition. Terra rossa (FAO: Cambisols and Phaeozems) soils develop on hard marine sedimentary bedrock (limestone and dolomite) primarily through atmospheric deposition [49,61]. This is evident from examination of plants growing on these soils since they incorporate bioavailable strontium with 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.7086 ± 0.0003. Moffat et al. [62] report two soil data points in the vicinity of the site that agree with 87Sr/86Sr ratios ranging from 0.70828–0.70870. In contrast, isoscapes are not as well developed in Egypt. A literature review of isotopic studies for the Nile Valley presents a median based on both animal and human data of 0.7076 ± 0.0003. However, the analyzed faunal samples show sizeable ranges and much wider ranges than the majority of the human samples. While the data from Tell el-Dab‘a (Hutwaret/Avaris) in the northeastern Nile Delta fits this range [63], it is problematically drawn from six archaeological bone samples. Strontium analysis from bone is problematic due to the greater impact of diagenesis on bone [64] as there is no accepted pretreatment that can fully deal with the issue of diagenesis in bone [65]. In addition, one of the Egyptian “baseline” animals is an equid, which is potentially a very mobile animal in the landscape as is argued here. Human burials from the Nile Valley yield tighter ratio ranges. For example, Memphis in Lower Egypt, =0.7078 ± 0.003; range 0.7074–0.7087 [66]. Although not exclusive to the Nile Valley, the strontium ratios do not contradict the other two independent lines of isotopic evidence – carbon and oxygen, that argue for Egyptian origins of EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4. The statistical analyses display two clusters. The first and second molars of EQ1 (while that individual lived in Egypt), EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 all cluster on the right side of the graph (Fig 7). As does OC (Caprine) #3 – previously identified as having an Egyptian origin [2,51]. EQ21 and most caprines (apart from OC#3) all cluster on the left side of the graph. Also, on the left side of the graph, are the two samples closest to the REJ of EQ1’s M3 as these are the final samples to mineralize and thereby incorporate the isotopic signatures surrounding the site. From the pooled data of carbon, oxygen and strontium isotope values, we define a foreign cluster (EQ2, EQ3, EQ4, EQ1 first and second molars and OC#3) versus a local cluster at the site that includes EQ21, all other OC, the two final samples of EQ1’s third molar, one final sample of EQ2 and the two final samples of EQ4. All equids imported from Egypt are buried, fully articulated in household contexts and under habitation floors. Only equids receive this treatment and only equids from Egypt. One goat indicates Egyptian origins but was not intentionally buried [51]. Rather it was butchered, eaten and its remains discarded in a midden. One donkey (EQ21) does not have isotopic values that indicate its origin in Egypt, and it was also not intentionally buried. It was butchered and its remains were discarded. From our analysis, the donkeys imported from Egypt had greater social value than those raised and utilized locally. Cross-culturally, the selection of sacrificial animals is known to be based on criteria such as age, sex, species [67] and even coat color when preservation allows [68,69], but never seemingly selected based on geographic origin. From the perspective of the isotope studies, it is the Egyptian import status that is one of the key criteria for an animal to be selected for sacrifice. Being young and female are the other two variables. Thus, young female donkeys from Egypt are the ideal sacrificial animal at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath during the EB III. Perhaps, as noted elsewhere, they represented a distinct totem animal linked with the identity of inhabitants as merchants/traders [9]. These stand in contrast to a local equid (EQ21 – unable to determine sex) that was butchered and likely eaten. EQ21 derives from an earlier deposit at the site (Stratum E7) which slightly pre-dates the four completely articulated equid burials (probably less than 50 years). It is suggested that even within this preferred group, EQ1 is noteworthy. EQ1 was buried with the front and hind legs tied together (trussed) below the abdomen, and the upper neck (cervical) vertebra and cranium dismembered and placed on the abdomen facing east. It is evident the animal was sacrificed, the head entirely cut off and carefully placed on the abdomen facing in the opposite direction [1]. In contrast, the other equids were buried without trussed limbs and without decapitation. In addition, it appears that EQ1 alone was prepared for sacrifice as the isotopic data indicates her residence at the site for several months prior to sacrifice as is evident from the three final data points (on M3 closest to REJ) as has been previously argued [2]. These final strontium ratios are also more radiogenic than the other equids and local livestock. These ratios reflect agricultural areas on terra rosa soils like those found to the west of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath [51]. It can be deduced that even though EQ1 was grazed locally toward the end of her life, she was treated slightly differently from the other local equids. This imported donkey was kept penned and foddered with hay that was harvested in the valley, a product of dry farmed cereals. This donkey was never herded with other livestock east of the site. The archaeological, iconographic and textual evidence from the broader region surrounding the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath highlights the centrality of equids in the culture and societies of the mid-3rd millennium BCE. Equids are known as work animals within the agricultural systems, used for plowing, threshing and as draft animals. In addition, equids played a significant role in trade, not only moving goods on their backs but also as valuable trade items themselves [33,70–72]. It is clear that some equids were elevated to the status of prestige animals as evidenced by their intentional sacrifice and burial at sites across the Levant, Syria and Mesopotamia. Notably, these burials occur in a variety of different contexts, both domestic [33] and elite [70,73,74], singularly and in pairs [75], both males and females and varying in age from nine months [75] to nine years [76]. This suggests regional preferences for specific types of equids for sacrifice, such as those from Egypt, as is proposed here. Further, the textual data also discusses selective breeding of equids and desired qualities of animals for particular purposes [73,75]. Our analysis has demonstrated that the non-local donkeys (young females in particular) were preferentially selected for sacrifice and burial beneath the floors of buildings as the neighborhood is being renewed in the Early Bronze III urban center at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath. The isotopic analysis suggests that imported Egyptian asses were preferentially selected as sacrificial animals, while locally raised equids were butchered and likely eaten. The data further highlights the charged ritual significance and value of select donkeys in this period of early complex state-level urban societies in the region. It was not any donkey that was deemed worthy of sacrifice at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath, but only Egyptian young females. This suggests the function of these sacrifices is not simply a totem animal or an occupation marker but was socially and ritually charged by having come from Egypt. The importance and charged significance of the display of economic, and likely social and political connections with Egypt, was an integral part of the sacrificial ritual. Thus, an Egyptian donkey might have been seen as an exotic and special animal, worthy of specific ritual use. All necessary permits were obtained for the study described, which complied with all relevant regulations. Excavation permits were issued to Aren Maeir by the Israel Antiquities Authority (Permit #, G-56/2008, G-51/2010, G-66/2016, G-62/2017). Permits for export of material from Israel were issued to Aren Maeir by the Israel Antiquities Authority (Permit # 13840 – July 25, 2012). Additional information regarding the ethical, cultural, and scientific considerations specific to inclusivity in global research is included in the Supporting Information (Supplementary S1 Checklist) Two radiocarbon contexts (RTD 6830 and RTD 6844) from Stratum E5c were measured from Building 134307, in which donkey (EQ1) was buried. The samples were taken from an installation (E15AM09) (Fig 9). Sample RTD 6830 (Basket # TS12E15AM100) was taken within broken sherds of a holemouth cooking pot found inside a cooking installation built of stones. Seeds were measured in three separate targets to reach a higher precision for the context. For sample RTD 6844 (Basket # TS12E15AM083), seeds were taken from a thin white layer of phytoliths covering the cooking installation. Four separate targets were measured for a high precision date. For the sampling, pretreatment and measurement protocols [77–81] of the Dangoor Research Accelerator Spectroemter at the Weizmann Institute. The radiocarbon dates were calibrated using Oxcal v4.4.4 Bronk Ramsey (2021) software based on the calibration curve Reimer et al 2020 [81]. The measurements of each context were combined using the Rcombine function in the Oxcal v4.4.4 program, and both contexts passed the χ2 test. We built a small model using Oxcal v4.4.4 software [80,81] together with the samples from Stratum E5a [14], including a sequential boundary between the layers, since no samples from Stratum E5b were measured from this room. The agreement of the model is 61%. The modeled 68.3% results range between 2870−2670 BC for layer E5c, with three to four more likely ranges of years within those 200 years of probability distributions (Fig 10 and Table 2). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.t002 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g009 The 68.3% probability distributions are plotted in darker color and marked by a line underneath the plots. The 68.3% probability distributions are plotted in darker color and marked by a line underneath the plots. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g010 As each analyzed equid individual had an intact mandible, it was possible to sample all three molar teeth from each individual (Table 3). The total number of teeth per sample was determined by the size of the tooth. The third molar from EQ4 was sampled less due to breakage. Sequential sampling of teeth followed methods outlined by Bocherens et al. [82]. A series of 1.0 mm bands were drilled sequentially along the mesial lobe of each molar tooth. Dentin and cementum were removed from the equine teeth [83] prior to enamel sampling. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.t003 Pretreatment of the samples followed the methods of Balasse and colleagues [84–86]. The tooth enamel was treated with a 2.5% NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite) solution overnight to remove organics and then rinsed five times with distilled water and treated with 0.1M CH3COOH (acetic acid, pH3) for four hours to remove diagenetic carbonates. The samples were then rinsed five times with distilled water and freeze-dried. Even-numbered samples were analyzed for strontium isotope ratios and odd-numbered samples were analyzed for carbon and oxygen isotope compositions. Strontium isotope measurements were performed on a Nu Plasma HR multi-collector inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Geology Department. Tooth enamel samples were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 3N nitric acid (HNO3) under clean lab conditions. Cation exchange columns loaded with Eichrom® Sr spec resin and pre-conditioned with 3N HNO3 were prepared and the 0.5 ml samples were then loaded. Column blanks consisted of 0.5 ml of 3N HNO3. Columns were washed four times with 0.3 ml of 3N HNO3 and then strontium was eluted into 4 ml Teflon® vials with 1 ml of 0.05N HNO3 and 3 ml of ultrapure deionized water (Milli-Q, Millipore) following Horwitz et al. [87]. Sample concentrations are measured and corrected to optimal range. Linear normalization of sample results was applied based on within-run trends in SRM 987 relative to its accepted value (0.710255). Analytical precision on repeated standard measurements was ± 0.00003. Carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses were performed in the Department of Anthropology’s Stable Isotope Laboratory and the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Approximately 700 μg of the prepared sample was weighed into individual vessels and reacted with 100% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) at 70°C in an automated Kiel III carbonate device in which CO2 is liberated from enamel, cryogenically distilled, and subsequently flowed to a Finnigan MAT 252 isotopic ratio mass spectrometer. Two laboratory standards (NBS18 and NBS 19) were interspersed, and replicates were run to ensure accuracy. Analytical precision is typically ±0.07‰ for δ13C and ±0.14‰ for δ18O. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.s004 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.s005 (DOCX) We are grateful for the assistance of Stanley H.

U.S. stock futures are ticking higher as investors continue to monitor the White House for updates on tariff policies; Nvidia (NVDA) stock approaches a $4 trillion market capitalization; Starbucks (SBUX) reportedly has attracted offers for a potential stake sale in its Chinese operations that value the unit at up to $10 billion; U.S.-listed shares of Verona Pharma (VRNA) are jumping in premarket trading after Merck (MRK) agreed to purchase the company for $10 billion; and AES (AES) shares are soaring on a report that the renewable energy provider is exploring a potential sale. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly higher as investors watch for more tariffs developments. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.2% after the blue-chip index shed 0.4% in the prior session. S&P 500 futures are edging higher after the benchmark index declined slightly yesterday, while Nasdaq futures are up slightly after the tech-heavy index inched higher Tuesday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is ticking higher to trade at around $109,000. The 10-year Treasury note yield is little changed. Oil futures are slightly higher. Gold futures are declining. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are in focus as the AI chipmaker comes close to becoming the most valuable company in history. Nvidia stock rose just over 1% Tuesday to close at an all-time high of exactly $160, pushing its market capitalization to $3.90 trillion. That's just below Apple's (AAPL) closing record of $3.91 trillion last December. Nvidia could reach a market cap of $4 trillion if its share price moves to $163.93. Nvidia shares are edging higher in premarket trading. Starbucks (SBUX) reportedly has attracted offers for a potential stake sale in its Chinese operations that value the unit at up to $10 billion. CNBC said that "almost 30 domestic and foreign private equity firms in China have submitted non-binding offers," adding that Starbucks may retain a 30% stake. According to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter, most prospective investors in Starbucks' Chinese business "are eyeing a controlling stake in the operation." Starbucks shares are nearly 2% higher in premarket trading. U.S.-listed shares of London-based Verona Pharma (VRNA) are surging 20% in premarket trading after the firm agreed to be acquired by U.S. drug giant Merck (MRK) for $107 per American depositary share, or about $10 billion. The acquisition will add chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment Ohtuvayre, which the Food and Drug Administration approved in June 2024, to Merck's drug portfolio. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. AES (AES) shares are soaring nearly 15% in premarket trading on a Bloomberg report that the renewable energy provider "is exploring options including a potential sale amid takeover interest." AES has signed deals several tech firms, including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), to provide renewable power for data centers. Infrastructure investors including BlackRock's (BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners unit and Brookfield Asset Management "have been studying AES after the company's shares lost about half their value over the past two years," the report said.

Title: Challenge of predicting Texas floods and SCOTUS allows for mass federal layoffs: Morning Rundown

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Meteorologists and forecasting experts say the severity of the deadly Texas floods couldn’t have been predicted. The Supreme Court allows Donald Trump to move forward with mass firings. And more pet owners are opting into insurance for their furry family members. Here’s what to know today. At least 161 people are missing after catastrophic floods tore through the Texas Hill Country, Gov. Greg Abbott said yesterday, as the desperate search for survivors continues. The death toll rose to at least 110 people. Meanwhile, scrutiny and questions are mounting about how and when people in the area received flash flood alerts. Among those questions: What actions were taken to notify residents? Were emergency alerts adequate, and who issued them? It was also unclear whether alerts were received on all phones. At a news conference yesterday, local officials and law enforcement in Kerr County couldn’t provide basic details of the emergency response. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. While National Weather Service forecasters had warned broadly about flash flooding ahead of time, the best weather models could not have predicted precisely where the most intense rainfall would land, or that the deluge would stall out over a flood-prone basin, meteorologists and forecasting experts said. Texas state climatologist John Neilsen-Gammon called such a prediction “next to impossible.” What did happen was that “all the ingredients came together at the wrong place, at the wrong time, at night on a holiday weekend,” said David Gagne, a National Center for Atmospheric Research scientist. Though NOAA is working to build better weather models, that research is on the chopping block. As science reporter Evan Bush explains, a succession of thunderstorms fed by the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry hit the region. Weather charts showed that the south fork of the Guadalupe River took a direct and prolonged hit. Then, instead of moving on, the storms stalled and dumped 10-12 inches of rain over six hours. Making matters worse, the area — consisting of steep hills and narrow canyons that rapidly funnel water from smaller creeks into swollen rivers — was filled with campers near the river’s edge. If the storm had been even five miles in another direction, it would not have produced as much destruction, Nilsen-Gammon said. Read the full story here. The Supreme Court has allowed President Donald Trump, at least temporarily, to move ahead with plans to impose mass firings of the federal workforce and reorganize various government agencies. The decision affects 19 federal agencies, as well as the White House-adjacent Office of Management and Budget, Office of Personnel Management and U.S. DOGE Service. The court’s decision yesterday was a response to a ruling from California-based U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, who blocked Trump’s plans in May, saying that while the president can seek to make changes to the workforce, there are limits when they are done wholesale. The Trump administration, however, argued that the president does not need permission from Congress to carry out his duties as stated in the Constitution. The justices made clear that their order is not about the legality of any individual agency reduction in force or reorganization plan, only the legality of Trump’s executive order and an administration memo related to workforce plans. Ketanji Brown Jackson, the only justice to provide a written dissent, sharply criticized the decision as “hubristic and senseless.” Read the full story here. Small-town hospitals are buckling under strain from Trump’s sprawling domestic policy bill, signed into law last week. It includes sweeping cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act and could result in millions of Americans losing health care coverage. The package includes $50 billion for rural hospitals, though it won’t be enough to offset the Medicaid and ACA cuts, one expert said. Now, hospitals are already considering how to adapt to a shifting budget, even if some of the Trump bill’s changes won’t take effect for a few years. Some smaller hospitals are already closing their doors due to growing financial strain. The Nebraska-based Community Hospital said last week that it’s shutting down its medical center in Curtis, a town of around 900 people. In Hugo, Colorado, Kevin Stansbury, the CEO of the Lincoln Community Hospital and Care Center, said he may soon have to start cutting services for patients at the 25-bed rural hospital. And in Kansas, Benjamin Anderson, CEO of Hutchinson Regional Healthcare System, said he’s evaluating how the only hospital for many residents of South Central Kansas will be able to keep offering all of its services, which include hospice and home care, women’s health and pediatric care. Read the full story here. My cat Macaroni is pretty unusual, and not only because he can whine loud enough to be heard two floors down or because he’s missing a back left paw — but because he’s insured. Most pet owners don’t buy coverage for their animals. Of the nearly 90 million dogs and almost 74 million cats in the U.S., both species’ insured rates remain in the single digits. But that’s changing fast, as business intern Evie Steele reports. Spending on pet insurance has grown by at least 20% each year since 2020, hitting more than $4.7 billion last year, according to one industry estimate. Evie found consumers have strong opinions on whether pet insurance is worth it — most policies don’t cover pre-existing conditions — but analysts broadly expect the market to keep growing. — Rich Bellis, senior business editor The discounts are just starting on the second day of Amazon Prime Day.

Title: Sweeping Layoffs Hit Tech And Media Giants Citing AI Take Over

ByMartine Paris ByMartine Paris, Contributor. Learning to work with AI. With AI being credited for doing half the work at Salesforce by CEO Marc Benioff, a growing number of companies have been firing teams in response to the rise in AI adoption. Here’s a running list of layoffs. Blue Origin, the Jeff Bezos space venture, is axing 1,000 jobs, nearly 10% of its workforce, to restructure for automation. Bumble is laying off 30% of its team, about 240 people, to better compete with AI-powered dating apps like Hinge. Business Insider is cutting 21% of its team as it goes all-in on AI to respond to the decline in Google search traffic. Dropbox downsized by 20% at the end of last year in its transition to AI offerings. Google, whose AI summaries are accelerating the demise of search traffic, has offered early retirement to its Search, Ads and Commerce teams. IBM slashed nearly 9,000 jobs, mostly in human resources as AI agents automate administrative tasks. Intel plans to layoff up to 20% of its factory workers as it pivots to AI. The company had over 100,000 employees at the end of last year. JPMorganChase is expecting a 10% reduction in operations staff as the company tells managers to do more with less, lean into AI, and focus on efficiencies. Meta is cutting 4,000 jobs, about 5% of its workforce, while doubling down on AI, poaching talent from OpenAI and hiring former Github CEO Nat Friedman to co-head its new Super Intelligence Labs with Scale AI’s Alexandr Wang. Microsoft eliminated 15,000 jobs this year, nearly 7% of its workforce, despite strong earnings, with CEO Satya Nadella citing 20% to 30% of its code now being written by AI tools. Company-wide sales, marketing, product and engineering teams, gaming divisions including Xbox, and management layers across the board are getting slashed. Ford CEO Jim Farley said AI will wipe out half of all white collar jobs in the coming years. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said AI could spike unemployment by 20%. And Nvidia just became the first-ever $4 trillion company. Clearly, this is just the beginning. Backlash has been significant against companies announcing AI-first strategies, like Duolingo, Klarna and Shopify, which were met with sharp criticism for suggesting contractors could be replaced by AI. Other tech giants have been scrambling with messaging. Amazon, which just celebrated deploying its 1 millionth robot in fulfillment centers, told Fast Company that despite widely reported rumors, it did not put 14,000 positions on the chopping block. And although Block, formerly known as Square, is eliminating 1,000 jobs, about 8% of staff, its co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey said the move is not to replace workers with AI. Despite mass layoffs, one engineer, Soham Parekh, managed not only to land several tech jobs, but work them simultaneously. He became a meme last week when his skill at beating the recruiting machine went viral. Amid the frenzy of posts were prominent AI investors Reid Hoffman and Mark Cuban. Box CEO Aaron Levie opined, “If Soham immediately comes clean and says he was working to train an AI Agent for knowledge work, he raises at $100M pre by the weekend.” Updated with Nvidia $4 billion market cap news.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BANGKOK, THAILAND - JUNE 27: The Netflix and Squid Game logos are seen in front of the Giant Swing ... More and Wat Suthat Thep Wararam in Bangkok, Thailand on June 27, 2025. Netflix Squid Game Season 3 has been released on June 27, 2025. (Photo by Valeria Mongelli/Anadolu via Getty Images) Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is anticipated to announce its Q2 2025 earnings on Thursday, July 17, 2025. According to consensus estimates, revenues are expected to reach approximately $11 billion for the quarter, representing a 15% increase compared to the previous year, while earnings are projected to be $7.06 per share, up from $4.88 during the same period last year. This growth is likely to be driven by recent price hikes and increasing advertising revenue. Earlier this year, Netflix raised the cost of its standard HD plan by $2.50 to $18 per month and increased the price of the Premium plan to $25 per month. The company has also been concentrating on enhancing its advertising technologies, launching its in-house ad tech platform in the U.S. this past April. This initiative could help improve ad capabilities and pricing realizations. Year-over-year revenue comparisons will also benefit from stronger subscriber counts over the last year, partly driven by the crackdown on password sharing and the introduction of the ad-supported tier, even though the impact of these initiatives may start to lessen. We will also monitor Netflix's margins for the quarter closely. This year, Netflix's content costs are expected to increase. While the company has generally focused on scripted entertainment, it is currently branching out into live sports, which may entail higher production and licensing expenses. Netflix has a current market capitalization of $551 billion. Over the last twelve months, revenue totaled $40 billion, with the company being operationally profitable, reporting $11 billion in operating profits and net income of $9.3 billion. Therefore, if you’re looking for upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its launch. View earnings reaction history for all stocks Here are some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data for the 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings is summarized along with the statistics in the table below. NFLX 1D, 5D, and 21D Post Earnings Return A relatively less risky strategy (though not beneficial if the correlation is low) is to examine the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns after earnings, identify the pair with the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the highest correlation, a trader could take a “long” position for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. The correlation labeled 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. NFLX Correlation Among 1D, 5D, and 21D Historical Returns Discover more about the Trefis RV strategy, which has exceeded its all-cap stocks benchmark (a mixture of all 3: the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000) to yield substantial returns for investors. In addition, if you're looking for upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock like Netflix, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved over 91% returns since its inception.

Title: See the billionaires and CEOs at the Sun Valley 'summer camp for billionaires' this year

For tech and media moguls, Sun Valley is the place to be this week. The annual Allen & Co. Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, is hallowed ground where billionaires and CEOs rub shoulders and strike deals. Allen & Co., the organizer of the off-the-record event, is a boutique investment firm. Over the years the summit has hosted the likes of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. Sun Valley has also played a part in major deals over the years, such as Disney's acquisition of ABC and Comcast's takeover of NBCUniversal. The summit kicked off Tuesday and is set to go through the weekend. Here's a look at who's attending this year: OpenAI chief Sam Altman arrived in Sun Valley wearing a simple navy blue T-shirt and chunky white sunglasses from Vuarnet. The glasses, inspired by 1970s ski masks, retail for $410, according to the brand's website. Altman's entry into Sun Valley comes shortly after he said last month that Meta was "crazy" for trying to poach top AI talent from OpenAI with $100 million signing bonuses. He was also joined at the conference by OpenAI's chief operating officer, Brad Lightcap. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet — Google's parent company, wore an all-blue outfit on the first day of the conference, with a button-down, indigo jeans, and dark sunglasses. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, arrived in Sun Valley in his signature simple style, wearing a navy polo, square-rim black glasses, and a fitness tracker on his wrist. He had a bag slung over his shoulder and waved to the cameras. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek stuck to founder-core fashion at Sun Valley in a black zip-up hoodie, a matching polo underneath, and dark denim. He carried a notebook. Former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg arrived in Sun Valley hand in hand with her husband, Tom Bernthal, the former CEO of consulting agency Kelton Global. The pair was dressed for comfort — Sandberg wore a cropped black cardigan with a black top under, paired with light-wash blue jeans, while Bernthal wore a collared cream sweater and gray slacks. Sandberg stepped down from Meta in 2022. She is the founder of LeanIn.Org, a nonprofit organization for women. Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy came to Sun Valley in a printed T-shirt with a blue button-down thrown over, paired with black sunglasses. The Sun Valley retreat comes shortly after Jassy said AI will eliminate some jobs at Amazon, but create some roles in AI and robotics. On the first day of the conference, Bob Iger, Disney's CEO, wore a white polo shirt and black-tinted sunglasses to complete the look. Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, arrived at Sun Valley on day one sporting a navy Thalia Surf baseball cap, a Rivian logo tee, and a smart fitness tracker. He recently talked to BI about the impact President Donald Trump's new Big, Beautiful Bill would have on Rivian, an EV company. Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, wore a navy polo with contrast piping, an SV25-branded cap, and sleek frameless glasses for the occasion. Nadella recently said that the hardest challenge with AI was not building or deploying it, but rather getting employees to change the way they work. Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone opted for a laid-back style at Sun Valley — dressed in a navy crewneck tee, gray utility pants, and black sunglasses hanging from his collar. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wore athleisure at Sun Valley: a fitted blue T-shirt, a navy SV-branded cap, and dark shades hanging from his collar. He had a sweatshirt tied around his waist and a cup of coffee in his hand. The CEO recently weighed in on an important question many Uber users have: when customers should tip. "Tipping is entirely optional," Khosrowshahi said in a June interview on CBS Sunday Morning. "But if you feel like you got a good ride, if the service quality was terrific, then you can tip through the app." General Motors' CEO, Mary Barra, arrived in Sun Valley wearing a crisp white blouse with flared cuffs, paired with beige trousers. She accessorized the outfit with a quilted black Dior tote, a black portfolio, and a pair of black sunglasses, which she carried in her hand. Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos kept it simple at Sun Valley, flashing a relaxed wave in a charcoal polo shirt. Sarandos recently spoke out about how AI won't replace humans in storytelling but could help creators make movies on much smaller budgets. Netflix's finance chief, Spencer Neumann, strode into the conference dressed in a black polo and relaxed-fit jeans, with a brown outerwear in hand and holding a carry-on. Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of video gaming company Activision Blizzard, stepped into Sun Valley sporting a crisp white polo, gray trousers, and aviator shades tucked at the collar. The ex-CEO last year expressed interest in buying TikTok, which faces a divest-or-ban deadline in the US. PayPal chairman and former Nike CEO John Donahoe kept things classic on the first day of the conference in a navy polo, dark-wash denim jeans, and sunglasses clipped at the chest. Donahoe stepped down as Nike's CEO last year and was replaced by longtime Nike veteran Elliott Hill. News Corp.'s CEO, Robert Thomson, leaned into mountain casual at Sun Valley in a classic plaid flannel layers over a black T-shirt, light-wash jeans, and brown belt. Thomson, 64, wore a black baseball cap and accessorized with red wristbands and silver jewelry. Spotify's co-president, Alex Norström, stepped out in a textured gray jacket over a crisp white T-shirt. He accessorized with chunky black sunglasses and reading glasses draped around his collar. Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner kept it cozy on the first day of the conference, donning a soft blue sweater layered over a striped button-down. He also wore a thin leather necklace with a ring around his neck. Eisner, 83, paired the look with round-frame sunglasses and a bright blue baseball cap. He stepped down as Disney's CEO 20 years ago. Environmental Defense Fund's president, Fred Krupp, kept it sharp and understated in a pale blue button-down and dark slacks. He was pictures holding a dark navy blazer and a black zip portfolio. Jared Kushner dressed in minimalist fashion at Sun Valley in a fitted black button-down, a black T-shirt underneath, paired with dark sunglasses. He was pictured walking alongside Warner Bros. Discovery's CEO, David Zaslav, who wore a pale gray cargo jacket with a blue shirt underneath, white pants, and aviator-style glasses. Last month, Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders a 4% pay raise proposal for Zaslav, as the company battles declining sales and a falling stock price. LinkedIn's cofounder, Reid Hoffman, arrived in Sun Valley in a dark jacket, thrown over a blue shirt. He was pictured alongside Yahoo's cofounder, Jerry Yang. Hoffman recently said that Gen Z graduates are "enormously attractive" hires to employers because of their familiarity with AI. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, wore a minimalist outfit to Sun Valley: a plain, tight-fitting black tee, a navy cap, and a matching jacket tucked under one arm. Bill McDermott, CEO of software company ServiceNow, waved to photojournalists as he arrived in Sun Valley in a black utility jacket, beige collared shirt, and red-tinted shades. CBS Mornings co-host Gayle King arrived in Sun Valley in radiant summer whites, wearing a sleeveless blouse and layered pearl necklaces. She accessorized with chunky white bangles, cat-eye glasses, and held a bright yellow phone in her hand. The couple showed up in black and white patterned tops. President Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, are also in attendance at Sun Valley. They were each photographed walking alongside Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan wore a dark gray jacket over his lighter gray shirt, and black sunglasses to round out the look. Sony CEO Hiroki Totoki had a navy crossbody bag and jacket tied around his shoulders. Fashion designer Bendet Eisner, who is the founder and CEO of Alice + Olivia, wore a colorful matching set and accessorized her handbag with several charms — including a Labubu. Witz and her husband left lunch with a copy of Barry Diller's book, "Who Knew." Lütke and his wife, Fiona McKean, wore denim as they walked to a morning session at the conference. McKean wore a top from Finnish design house Marimekko. Kent layered a colorful outfit while his wife, Monica Meacci, stuck with an all-white look. Hastings was seen talking with Philippe Laffont, founder of Coatue Management, pictured at left here. Netflix's co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, was also in attendance at the conference. Silver was seen carrying notes and a laptop as he walked around the conference grounds. Former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers took a phone call between sessions.

July 08, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: After Amazon's Hit Show, New Fallout Rumor Makes A Lot More Sense
URL: https://screenrant.com/fallout-games-multiple-projects-bethesda-leak/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T00:00:20Z
Full Content:
Although the franchise has always been an iconic pillar of the RPG genre, Amazon's Fallout show helped bring the series to a much wider audience of new viewers. Not only was the record-breaking series a hit with plenty of fans, but it also caused a massive spike in player counts for Bethesda's older Fallout games. Despite the show's significant success, Bethesda seemed somewhat unprepared to take advantage of the spike in popularity, which thankfully might be changing this second time around. While it will likely be a long wait until the highly anticipated Fallout 5 makes its appearance, official confirmation of a third season for Fallout means there won't be a content drought for too long. If its first season was anything to go by, the show's follow-ups are likely to be another smashing success for Amazon, which could have some significant benefits for Fallout players. Whether we'll be getting a look at the next entry in the series or some surprise projects, a recent report is a great sign of things to come. As reported by ComicBook, Video Games Chronicle's Jordan Middler made some significant claims regarding the future of the Fallout series after the recent layoffs at Xbox. As a guest on an episode of the Friends Per Second podcast, Middler claimed that "There are multiple Fallout projects in development," which he says includes "that one I'm sure you're all wanting". While the vague statements don't explicitly confirm any specific hopes for future Fallout content, it would honestly be more of a surprise if Bethesda didn't have more Fallout projects in the works. Although the vague rumor isn't too much to go on, the idea that we could see a new major release for the Fallout series following the second or third season of the Fallout show would be a more than welcome surprise. Even if Middler says that we're "not going to be playing this game anytime soon" regarding the biggest project from the studio, it's only a part of what's coming to the series in the future. Bethesda has confirmed the upcoming Fallout 5 won't be released until some time after the next Elder Scrolls game, so it's much more likely that the next big project for the series will be in the form of a remaster. Much like Bethesda's latest The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, it's not hard to see a modern overhaul of Fallout New Vegas or the heavily rumored remake of Fallout 3 being a massive success for the studio. Even if Fallout 3 would be the more likely candidate given its in-house development at Bethesda, Fallout New Vegas is easily the more popular choice among fans, given its cult classic nature and significant ties to the show. Oblivion Remastered has been massively successful, and if a Fallout 3 remaster wants to achieve the same result, some changes will need to be made. While Bethesda may not be quite ready to announce a new sequel or even a remake by the time Fallout's second season rolls around, there's still plenty of room to take advantage of its popularity. Even mobile games like Fallout Shelter show just how much potential the series can have in other mediums, not to mention the Fallout 76 MMO still going strong years after release to show there's still plenty of love to be had for the Fallout franchise.

Your comment has not been saved This thread is open for discussion. Be the first to post your thoughts. In its prime, it was hard to argue against Final Fantasy as the greatest JRPG series ever, but another has proven to be even greater. A new Stephen King show with a 75% Rotten Tomatoes score gets a promising season 2 update from writer Benjamin Cavell and director Jack Bender. The Jedi of the Star Wars prequel era made their biggest mistake long before the devastation of the Clone Wars and the tragedy of Order 66. The new Superman movie proves that David Corenswet's Superman is the best live-action version of the hero despite the high bar that had been set. The world's darkest and most extreme zombie series shocks fans in lots of way, but one of the most extreme is turning Prince Harry into a villain. Will Trent theories often relate to how the show might better incorporate the books, but a new Angie theory has problematic implications for season 4. F1 The Movie, which stars Brad Pitt and Damson Idris, races past another domestic box office milestone as it climbs up a major all-time chart.

July 08, 2025 16:11 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) on behalf of purchasers of Elevance securities between April 18, 2024 through October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period may, no later than JULY 11, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Elevance, based in Indianapolis, Ind., is a healthcare company that, among other things, provides health insurance plans to a variety of markets, including contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits for eligible beneficiaries. States regularly conduct an eligibility review to “redetermine” whether Medicaid beneficiaries still qualify for coverage. The true state of Elevance’s finances began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to a closing price of $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Finally, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its financial results for Q3 2024, revealing that the Company had missed earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for Q3 by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Further, Elevance lowered EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to a closing price of $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member. Berger Montague, with offices in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Delaware, Washington, D.C., San Diego, San Francisco and Chicago, has been a pioneer in securities class action litigation since its founding in 1970.

Title: JPMorgan Will Become Trillion-Dollar Company Amid Adoption of ‘Most Transformational Technology,’ According to TD Cowen – Here’s When

The investment banking arm of TD Bank believes the market cap of JPMorgan will soar to $1 trillion as it leverages artificial intelligence (AI). In a new CNBC interview, TD Cowen bank analyst Steven Alexopoulos says investors are currently positioning in tech stocks to capture the upside potential of AI. The analyst notes that investors are likely underexposed to stocks that he thinks will rally once AI becomes widely adopted for commercial use. “When you think about where we are right now with AI, we’re at the builder level. The focus is Nvidia, the focus is OpenAI, the builders. I believe we’re inside of two years, maybe one, where the focus will widen out from the builders to who is going to use this technology to unlock massive economic value. That’s exactly what we saw on the internet. As the internet was being built, the focus was on Cisco, IBM, and as the layer was built, it moved to Google with search and Amazon selling commerce. When you think about the S&P 493… You need to focus on sectors that are reliant on people, knowledge workers, that is what will be disrupted by artificial intelligence.” According to the TD Cowen analyst, banks are poised to be major beneficiaries of AI advancements, with JPMorgan expected to lead the charge. Alexopoulos says that while JPMorgan’s head of consumer banking, Marianne Lake, expects the division’s headcount to decline by about 10% over the next five years, he believes that projection is conservative and anticipates a 20% reduction instead. According to Alexopoulos, JPMorgan’s growth will continue despite the significant drop in employee count. “[JPMorgan] is only richly valued relative to history, and that history did not include the most transformational technology of our lifetimes. Banks will break to a new valuation paradigm… By the end of next year, [JPMorgan] will be a trillion-dollar market-cap company.” As of Monday’s close, JPMorgan’s market cap stands at $811 billion.

WEKA unveiled NeuralMesh Axon, a breakthrough storage system that leverages an innovative fusion architecture designed to address the fundamental challenges of running exascale AI applications and workloads. NeuralMesh Axon seamlessly fuses with GPU servers and AI factories to streamline deployments, reduce costs, and significantly enhance AI workload responsiveness and performance, transforming underutilized GPU resources into a unified, high-performance infrastructure layer. Building on the company's recently announced NeuralMesh storage system, the new offering enhances its containerized microservices architecture with powerful embedded functionality, enabling AI pioneers, AI cloud and neocloud service providers to accelerate AI model development at extreme scale, particularly when combined with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software stacks for advanced model training and inference optimization. NeuralMesh Axon also supports real-time reasoning, with significantly improved time-to-first-token and overall token throughput, enabling customers to bring innovations to market faster. AI Infrastructure Obstacles Compound at Exascale Performance is make-or-break for large language model (LLM) training and inference workloads, especially when running at extreme scale. Organizations that run massive AI workloads on traditional storage architectures, which rely on replication-heavy approaches, waste NVMe capacity, face significant inefficiencies, and struggle with unpredictable performance and resource allocation. The reason? Traditional architectures weren't designed to process and store massive volumes of data in real-time. They create latency and bottlenecks in data pipelines and AI workflows that can cripple exascale AI deployments. Underutilized GPU servers and outdated data architectures turn premium hardware into idle capital, resulting in costly downtime for training workloads. Inference workloads struggle with memory-bound barriers, including key-value (KV) caches and hot data, resulting in reduced throughput and increased infrastructure strain. Limited KV cache offload capacity creates data access bottlenecks and complicates resource allocation for incoming prompts, directly impacting operational expenses and time-to-insight. Many organizations are transitioning to NVIDIA accelerated compute servers, paired with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, to address these challenges. However, without modern storage integration, they still encounter significant limitations in pipeline efficiency and overall GPU utilization. Built For The World's Largest and Most Demanding Accelerated Compute Environments To address these challenges, NeuralMesh Axon's high-performance, resilient storage fabric fuses directly into accelerated compute servers by leveraging local NVMe, spare CPU cores, and its existing network infrastructure. This unified, software-defined compute and storage layer delivers consistent microsecond latency for both local and remote workloads-outpacing traditional local protocols like NFS. Additionally, when leveraging WEKA's Augmented Memory Grid capability, it can provide near-memory speeds for KV cache loads at massive scale. Unlike replication-heavy approaches that squander aggregate capacity and collapse under failures, NeuralMesh Axon's unique erasure coding design tolerates up to four simultaneous node losses, sustains full throughput during rebuilds, and enables predefined resource allocation across the existing NVMe, CPU cores, and networking resources-transforming isolated disks into a memory-like storage pool at exascale and beyond while providing consistent low latency access to all addressable data. Cloud service providers and AI innovators operating at exascale require infrastructure solutions that can match the exponential growth in model complexity and dataset sizes. NeuralMesh Axon is specifically designed for organizations operating at the forefront of AI innovation that require immediate, extreme-scale performance rather than gradual scaling over time. This includes AI cloud providers and neoclouds building AI services, regional AI factories, major cloud providers developing AI solutions for enterprise customers, and large enterprise organizations deploying the most demanding AI inference and training solutions that must agilely scale and optimize their AI infrastructure investments to support rapid innovation cycles. Delivering Game-Changing Performance for Accelerated AI Innovation Early adopters, including Cohere, the industry's leading security-first enterprise AI company, are already seeing transformational results. Cohere is among WEKA's first customers to deploy NeuralMesh Axon to power its AI model training and inference workloads. Faced with high innovation costs, data transfer bottlenecks, and underutilized GPUs, Cohere first deployed NeuralMesh Axon in the public cloud to unify its AI stack and streamline operations. "For AI model builders, speed, GPU optimization, and cost-efficiency are mission-critical. That means using less hardware, generating more tokens, and running more models-without waiting on capacity or migrating data," said Autumn Moulder, vice president of engineering at Cohere. "Embedding WEKA's NeuralMesh Axon into our GPU servers enabled us to maximize utilization and accelerate every step of our AI pipelines. The performance gains have been game-changing: Inference deployments that used to take five minutes can occur in 15 seconds, with 10 times faster checkpointing. Our team can now iterate on and bring revolutionary new AI models, like North, to market with unprecedented speed." To improve training and help develop North, Cohere's secure AI agents platform, the company is deploying WEKA's NeuralMesh Axon on CoreWeave Cloud, creating a robust foundation to support real-time reasoning and deliver exceptional experiences for Cohere's end customers. "We're entering an era where AI advancement transcends raw compute alone-it's unleashed by intelligent infrastructure design. CoreWeave is redefining what's possible for AI pioneers by eliminating the complexities that constrain AI at scale," said Peter Salanki, CTO and co-founder at CoreWeave. "With WEKA's NeuralMesh Axon seamlessly integrated into CoreWeave's AI cloud infrastructure, we're bringing processing power directly to data, achieving microsecond latencies that reduce I/O wait time and deliver more than 30 GB/s read, 12 GB/s write, and 1 million IOPS to an individual GPU server. This breakthrough approach increases GPU utilization and empowers Cohere with the performance foundation they need to shatter inference speed barriers and deliver advanced AI solutions to their customers." "AI factories are defining the future of AI infrastructure built on NVIDIA accelerated compute and our ecosystem of NVIDIA Cloud Partners," said Marc Hamilton, vice president of solutions architecture and engineering at NVIDIA. "By optimizing inference at scale and embedding ultra-low latency NVMe storage close to the GPUs, organizations can unlock more bandwidth and extend the available on-GPU memory for any capacity. Partner solutions like WEKA's NeuralMesh Axon deployed with CoreWeave provide a critical foundation for accelerated inferencing while enabling next-generation AI services with exceptional performance and cost efficiency." The Benefits of Fusing Storage and Compute For AI Innovation NeuralMesh Axon delivers immediate, measurable improvements for AI builders and cloud service providers operating at exascale, including:

Title: David Ellison’s $8B Paramount Takeover Inches Forward as Drama Surrounds Deal

A second 90-day extension on Paramount Global’s proposed merger with David Ellison’s Skydance Media was triggered yesterday (July 7), giving regulators, company executives and the Federal Communications Commission more time to finalize and agree on the deal’s terms. One key hurdle remains: the FCC’s approval to transfer CBS’s broadcast licenses to Skydance, which must come from a commission currently led by Trump-appointed Republican Brendan Carr. Importantly, any ongoing negotiations will now play out against what’s presumed to be a more favorable regulatory climate, following Paramount’s controversial $16 million settlement with President Trump announced last week. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. That legal clash with the President stemmed from Trump’s lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with then–Vice President Kamala Harris, which he claimed had been unfairly edited. The settlement, which has drawn sharp scrutiny, is just the latest twist in what’s been perhaps Paramount’s most turbulent year in recent memory—a saga that’s seen the company shift from Redstone family control to the edge of a new era under David Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. For decades, Paramount embodied everything old Hollywood stood for, from its air of glamour to its dynastic leadership. This is the studio that gave moviegoers The Godfather and Top Gun and TV audiences hits like Cheers and Frasier. But with a merger in motion to hand the reins to Skydance, Paramount is now poised to become something very different: a tech-forward brand working to reinvent itself in an industry that’s long since moved on from the old rules. Needless to say, the road to this moment hasn’t been smooth. If anything, the story of how Paramount got here reads less like a typical business evolution and more like one of Taylor Sheridan’s soapy dramas on Paramount+, this one featuring a media dynasty clinging to power as its empire is carved up by outsiders. The $16 million settlement with Trump wasn’t just about clearing a legal hurdle; it was also seen as a way to neutralize a potential political threat. Inside Paramount, there were real fears that Trump could use regulatory leverage to derail the Skydance merger. That concern now seems far from hypothetical. On July 3, Trump appeared to confirm the existence of a “side deal” with Ellison that’s worth between $32 million and $35 million. He was referencing what Fox Business’s Charlie Gasparino first reported as a private commitment by Ellison to run PSAs supporting Trump-aligned causes. Paramount has denied any knowledge of such an arrangement, but Trump’s comments are likely to intensify worries about editorial independence within CBS News. “What you’re seeing now is all must pay tribute to the king,” said Jon Stewart, whose The Daily Show airs on Paramount-owned Comedy Central, during a recent appearance on The Bill Simmons Podcast. Stewart added that he, too, is bracing for whatever comes next: “I’m in a spot where I can do [The Daily Show] on Monday until the company is bought out by people that don’t want anything to do with The Daily Show.” South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, whose series streams on both Comedy Central and Paramount+, took to social media to slam the merger’s fallout for their show. “This merger is a [expletive] and it’s [expletive] up South Park,” they wrote in a post circulating on Instagram, responding to a delayed premiere announcement. “We are at the studio working on new episodes and we hope the fans get to see them somehow.” The wheels for much of this were set in motion back in late 2023, when Skydance first began exploring a merger with Paramount Global. At the time, cord-cutting was accelerating, streaming losses were mounting, and Wall Street had largely lost faith in Paramount’s long-term strategy. Then–CEO Bob Bakish was holding merger talks with several potential partners, including Warner Bros. Discovery. But it was Skydance’s interest that kicked everything into gear. From the start, the deal was complicated by one name: Redstone. Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, owns the family firm that effectively holds the keys to the company. Any buyer had to make her whole first, setting the stage for months of boardroom drama, internal power struggles and shareholder confusion. Skydance’s original offer, roughly $2 billion in cash and stock, triggered immediate backlash. Investors balked at the terms. Paramount’s special committee stalled. And in April 2024, Bakish was pushed out reportedly over disagreement with Redstone. The deal collapsed, and rival bidders began circling. Redstone seemed open to anything—until she wasn’t. Then, in a quiet but dramatic reversal, the Skydance talks were revived. This time, the restructured deal offered shareholders a better payout and a more straightforward path forward. By July 2024, an agreement was finalized: Skydance would merge with Paramount in an $8 billion transaction, ending the Redstone family’s decades-long grip on the studio. For many, the Redstones were synonymous with Paramount. Sumner Redstone built a sprawling media empire with ruthless focus. His daughter Shari spent years defending that legacy. But in the end, not even she could hold off the tide. Streaming hadn’t delivered, ad revenue was shrinking, and tech giants like Netflix, Apple and Amazon were outpacing Paramount at every turn. David Ellison has laid out a vision centered on A.I.-assisted production, a renewed focus on tentpole films and reshaping Paramount+ into a leaner, more viable streaming platform. Still, major hurdles remain. Layoffs have already impacted hundreds. And whether Skydance can actually pull off a successful integration—blending old-school Hollywood with a tech-forward playbook—is far from guaranteed. Ellison and his team will face pressure from all directions: investors, regulators, unions and the press. But at least for now, for the first time in years, Paramount’s future is beginning to take shape—even if it means letting go of everything it once was.

Considering Fallout 76 debuted in 2018, fans of the post-apocalyptic RPG series are anxious for new quests. Although Bethesda has yet to confirm any release dates, rumors suggest that multiple games are in development. In the Friends Per Second podcast, Jordan Middler of Video Games Chronicle confirmed that Fallout 3 Remastered is still in the works. Fallout 5 is also planned, but may not arrive until 2030 or later. However, Middler also referenced a potential Fallout 2 remaster and New Vegas follow-up. Part of the broadcast centered on the recent turmoil in Xbox Game Studios. The loss of 9,000 Microsoft jobs impacted developers, leading to untimely deaths of titles like Perfect Dark. After the layoffs, Microsoft wants to focus on profitable Xbox titles and IPs, like Fallout. Fallout 3 Remastered may be one of the first projects that's ready for public consumption. It's believed that Obisidian Entertainment is partnering with Virtuous, who developed Oblivion Remastered. Still, initial leaks indicated a 2023 release date, and Bethesda hasn't provided an official update. When the title inevitably arrives, players can expect Unreal Engine 5 to power its revamped visuals. For fans who don't consider Fallout 76 a mainline game, it's been a decade since Fallout 4 arrived. Insiders don't anticipate Fallout 5 surfacing anytime soon. Sadly, Middler also doesn't see any evidence of rushed development. What's even more unclear is the timeline for other Xbox games hinted at in the podcast. Bethesda and Obsidian are considering various spinoffs and remasters. One project in particular could excite fans of the 2010 Fallout: New Vegas. For now, the TV show will have to tide supporters over until any new Fallout game is ready. The second season of the Amazon-produced series will premiere in December 2025.

Title: A.I. Drives Job Cuts Across Silicon Valley Giants: By the Numbers

Tech layoffs are nothing new in Silicon Valley, a region long shaped by boom-and-bust hiring cycles, speculative investment and shifting economic conditions. But in recent months, executives have offered a different explanation for job cuts: the rapid rise of A.I. So far in 2025, nearly 400 tech companies have announced layoffs, affecting close to 94,000 employees, according to TrueUp’s tech layoff tracker. Many of these roles are expected to be replaced—directly or indirectly—by A.I.-driven efficiencies. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Salesforce, for example, cut 1,000 roles earlier this year, redirecting hiring toward sales roles focused on A.I.-powered products. CEO Marc Benioff said last month that A.I. currently handles 30 to 50 percent of the company’s work, reducing the need for roles in fields like software engineering and customer support. Despite the job cuts, Salesforce remains financially strong, reporting $9.8 billion in revenue for the February-April quarter, an 8 percent year-over-year increase. Microsoft, the world’s second largest company by market capitalization, has also made significant cuts in 2025. The company laid off around 9,000 employees in July, following a separate round of more than 6,000 in May. Software engineers have borne the brunt of these reductions. Though Microsoft has not explicitly linked the layoffs to A.I., the technology’s growing role inside the company is undeniable. In April, CEO Satya Nadella disclosed that A.I. now writes about 30 percent of Microsoft’s code—a figure he expects to climb. Microsoft isn’t alone in its internal shift toward A.I. At Google, well over 30 percent of new code includes A.I. generated suggestions, CEO Sundar Pichai revealed earlier this year. At Meta, Mark Zuckerberg has described developing an A.I. agent with coding abilities comparable to a mid-level engineer as one of the company’s top goals for 2025. Startups across Silicon Valley are following suit, increasingly requiring A.I. fluency in hiring and day-to-day operations. In a March memo to staff, Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke wrote that A.I. use is now “a fundamental expectation,” adding that any team requesting additional headcount or resources must first prove that the task can’t be handled by A.I. Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn echoed a similar stance the following month. He told employees that headcount increases would only be approved if teams demonstrate the need for human involvement over automation. A.I. proficiency, he added, will also play a bigger role in hiring and performance reviews. On top of that, Duolingo will stop using contractors for tasks that A.I. can complete. With 2025 only halfway through, A.I.-driven workforce changes are poised to continue. In a June memo, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy laid out the company’s sweeping integration of A.I. across areas like shopping, AWS, and internal operations. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time,” he wrote, “but in the next few years, we expect this will reduce our corporate workforce as we gain efficiency from using A.I. extensively across the company.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Own Gold, but Avoid the Golden Haircut

By Byron King PostedJuly 8, 2025 Today, we’ll discuss why you should own gold. But first… Let’s say that you walk into a bank. You hand the teller a $10-bill and ask for a roll of quarters, worth $10. Seems easy, right? It’s no big deal. Perhaps you want some quarters in case you must feed a parking meter or use the washer-dryer machines at a laundromat. A basic roll of quarters, $10-worth… plus tax. So, the teller hands you a roll of quarters, smiles, and says, “Here you go. Oh, and there’s $0.60 tax, too. It’s the new, 6% sales tax on transactions.” And you say, “Huh? I’m just exchanging paper currency for metal coins. And there’s tax?” “Yup,” says the teller. “The state government just passed an act saying that this kind of exchange is a ‘transaction’ under commercial law, subject to sales tax. And we’re required to collect it.” You stand there, totally perplexed as in… You. Must. Be. Kidding. Well, yes and no. I’m sort of kidding, but I’m not really kidding because… Hey, welcome to Maryland. Okay, don’t panic (not yet). Because right now there’s no Maryland sales tax if you go to the bank and exchange paper currency for every-day, widely used coins like quarters. But there is a new 6% Maryland tax if you exchange dollars for gold. Call it the new, golden haircut. The tax applies even to gold coins issued by the U.S. Mint, the same federal entity that produces those (so far) untaxed quarters. But quarters are not made from gold, which for some bizarre reason Maryland thinks is alright to tax. It used to be that Maryland taxed sales of gold under $1,000, but not over that number. The idea was that anything over $1,000 was an investment, not subject to sales tax. As a matter of course, Maryland gold dealers typically explained to customers why they should buy at least a little bit over $1,000 of gold at a time. Say, $1,005 or $1,010. Avoid the sales tax. But as of July 1, 2025, buying all forms of gold in Maryland is subject to sales tax. For example, $1,000 of gold will cost you $1,060. Or $10,000 of yellow metal will set you back $10,600. Etcetera… Do the math. The government’s take is 6%. This is all part of a new tax bill from the collective geniuses who make laws from their political power perch in the state capital of Annapolis. This past spring, the legislature of the Terrapin State passed a so-called “Blueprint for Maryland’s Future,” loaded with all manner of new spending – upwards of $3 billion – on schools, teacher training, education-related grift, and innumerable other stuff. But there was a problem with the new spending bill; it’s that the state treasury lacks funds to pay for all these high and lofty ambitions. So the new bill also increased taxes on a long list of items, notably applying state sales taxes to gold bullion over that former $1,000 level. The state anticipates a haul of about $3 million per year (yes, million with an “m.”) In the runup to passing this new spend-and-tax bill, a coalition of Maryland businesses that sell gold coins and bullion lobbied against the idea. They noted the likely miniscule government take from the new tax, versus the hassle to businesses. Truly, it’s a small drop in a big bucket. This business group also made the obvious point that customers can easily drive across state lines and buy gold in jurisdictions without sales tax on the metal: Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia and Delaware come to mind, as well as most of the rest of the country. Maryland gold buyers can always go elsewhere. When you consider that buying even a single, one-ounce U.S. gold Eagle coin involves handing over $3,500 or more, depending on dealer markup, it’s a stretch to believe that anyone will pay an extra 6% to conduct their gold business in Maryland. As even a casual glance at a map will show, geographically the state is perfectly shaped for its gold-buying citizens to drive up or down the proverbial road to somewhere else. And the Marylnd business coalition pointed out that the tax increase would likely wreck the in-state gold-selling aspect of many businesses by reducing volume, perhaps killing the gold-side entirely. And these businesses would possibly show less overall profitability, which means lower business taxes; that, and job losses, depending on how things work out. But no, the legislature didn’t absorb these arguments. Maryland raised the sales tax level for gold, and the future will unfold in its own way. Wait and see. In Maryland the government wants your money, and will do what it can to get your money. Yes, sure; that’s the case most everywhere, but very few other states tax gold sales. And even if the tax receipts don’t roll into Annapolis because the original scheme was kind of dumb to begin with, the collective political entity doesn’t particularly care. Perhaps you think that this news item doesn’t matter much because you don’t live in Maryland, nor buy gold there. And even if you live in Maryland, you’re more than willing to drive across the line to another state to buy your gold with no sales tax. Yes, fair enough… Then again, it’s no stretch to think that we may already be in the early innings of a dangerous political idea; namely, that governments everywhere – not just Maryland – are desperate for revenue, and they’re moving to tax gold sales, if not gold holdings. Because, to borrow a line from the old bank robber Willie Sutton, “That’s where the money is.” Clearly, in recent years the price of gold has moved up sharply. Just think back not-too-many years, to a time of gold at $1,250 per ounce, or $1,750 per ounce, or $2,250 per ounce. Indeed, for that last price, think back just a little over a year. By comparison, the current price of gold is north of $3,300 and rising. There’s little downside, and big blue sky above. Here at Paradigm Press, our own Jim Rickards believes that gold prices will climb up and over $4,000 per ounce by the end of the year, meaning within the next six months. Plus, until quite recently and at the retail level (at least in the U.S.), only quirky gold bugs bought gold. Owning a stash was more of a curiosity than a financial norm. But now, and for many reasons, more people are literally buying gold; even Costco sells it, and the giant, consumer-facing, mass-retail chain can’t keep it in stock. Any way you look at it, these cumulative gold sales involve growing numbers of people and represent a lot of money, which tends to attract politicians and tax collectors. Of course, there’s more to the gold story than coin shops and/or Costco. And for all the media coverage of gold, it appears that most American politicians really don’t get the monetary angle. They lack sufficient education and perspective on money even to process what’s happening with dollars and by extension with gold. That is, at numerous levels America’s government doesn’t understand its own money. In previous articles I’ve discussed how the price of gold is NOT moving higher because armies of retail buyers are mobbing the coin shops of America. No, gold has moved higher in price because central banks across the world (well, central banks outside of America) are buying metal by the tonne. Think of Russia, China, India, and dozens of other nations; first, they are de-dollarizing, and second, seek the security of gold in the vaults versus the risk of U.S. Treasuries subject to the whims of American politics and politicians. Slowly but surely, the global monetary system is headed for a reset. It may not be next week or next month, but something is coming. Meanwhile the U.S. government, via out-of-control spending and expansive monetary policy, is ruining its own currency. And this brings us back to an old, sturdy piece of wisdom, that “Gold is money,” according to banker J.P, Morgan, who made the remark over 115 years ago. “Everything else is credit,” he added. J.P. Morgan, American banker. Wiki Commons. Indeed, Morgan was testifying before Congress about how he bailed out the U.S. government from a financial Panic in 1907-08, and at the time all American politicians understood what he meant. In that era, America and the world were on a gold standard, and it was a given that gold was the foundation of wealth. Today, we’re five generations post-Morgan. Very few people have an inherent understanding of the gold standard. Very few colleges or universities teach much of anything about gold, outside the geology department. And in the West in general, and the U.S. in particular, studying gold as money is an arcane idea, kind of like a branch of economic archaeology. Modern American culture has become fully dollarized and financialized, courtesy of the Federal Reserve and its notes, which are basically just entries in a ledger book or electronic equivalent. The term commonly used is “money creation” from the Fed, as if wealth can be generated by willing it into existence versus delivering some article or service of value. Ideally, the Fed should create dollars only in enough quantity to reflect the true growth in productivity and material wealth of the internal American economy, plus the value of imports. But in practice, the Fed has created far more dollars than America (or the world) has created wealth over the past century, which is why a current dollar is worth about 2-cents from, say, 1914. In these respects, it’s fair to say that the American governing class has little to no understanding of the meaning of money itself; the politicians are just counting the Niagara of dollars that flow through the economy, in so far as that can even be correctly measured. And they’re grabbing for dollars in any tax scheme they can conjure up. I’ll wrap up by returning to the story of Maryland and its new tax on gold. The state wants to collect sales tax when people exchange fiat-money dollars for real-money gold. In essence, it’s a penalty on foresighted people who see problems ahead and want to exit the dollar system for the hard-money comfort and security of gold. Yes, sure; Maryland needs the money to fund the dreams of its silly politicians. But no, this doesn’t mean that you must play the game. Get your gold, put it away somewhere safe, don’t discuss it, and preserve your wealth until our cultural craziness plays out. That’s all for now. Thank you for subscribing and reading.

July 08, 2025 08:48 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

July 8, 2025 8:30am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Kate Moore, Citi Wealth CIO, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast, yet another extra special guest. Wow. What a fascinating career. Kate Moore is having. Her background is everything from Morgan Stanley to more capital to Bank America, Merrill Lynch to JP Morgan to BlackRock. She’s now Chief Investment officer of Citibank’s Citi Wealth, which runs, you know, something like a trillion dollars. The breadth and depth of her experience makes her uniquely situated to be a chief investment officer. She’s had, you know, just about every job on the buy side and sell side, including portfolio manager, consultant to LBOs and m and as she’s just done so much stuff, it’s so interesting that she really brings just this unique set of experiences to Citi. I thought this conversation was really interesting and I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with Kate Moore. Kate Moore: Thanks so much, Barry. I’m psyched to be having this conversation today Barry Ritholtz: Long overdue. Yeah, we’ve, we’ve been like ships in the night. I, I’m so glad I finally got, got you here. Let’s start a little bit with your academic background. Yeah. Which is kind of surprised me. Bachelor’s in political and social thought from the University of Virginia, a Master’s in Political Economy from University of Chicago. What was the original career plan? Kate Moore: I mean, I think Barry underlying your question was like, Kate, you sound kind of nerdy but not as nerdy as some of the folks who have like triple degrees in statistics. But so where did this political and social thought and political economy stuff come from? So at University of Virginia, this PST program is interdisciplinary and that was really attractive. You also apply during your second year so you have a chance to like send it, cut a sample, some different disciplines before you do it. And it’s an incredible seminar program. So you’re working with some really amazing professors throughout the way. I loved being able to take classes in economics, in politics, in theory, in philosophy. I also took a lot of studio art classes and stuff as an undergrad, but I was able to combine all of this stuff together. So I loved that. And then I worked for a couple years and I decided, you know, hey, what I really am good at and what I love is academics and I wanna be a professor. This was my, my idea. I’m gonna go back to school and get my PhD and be a professor. I had this whole vision for myself that involved like, you know, writing books in the summer I would be doing cool research. I have a pack of golden retrievers and you know, I’d like rock climb on the side. This is whole vision of my academic life. So I applied to PhD programs and I went to University of Chicago for political economy. So this intersection of policy and politics, you know, international theory and you know, economics. And I found once I was there, honestly, that many people in my program are taking eight to 10 years to get through their PhD and becoming so specialized in very arcane topics. And it was like not appealing to me since I had already worked and everything. So I left after my master’s, but I did my work on, you know, this intersection of economics and policy with a focus on emerging markets and China. So I was ahead of my time. Barry Ritholtz: It’s so interesting that you talk about how specialized some people become. It’s pretty clear, at least historically, many of the greatest investors in history had a very broad set of interest and a broad set of skills. Few of them were an inch wide and a mile deep. They weren’t a mile wide and an inch deep, but they were broad enough that they were able to pull in things from other fields that applied to investing. Did you find something similar when you’re studying political science and economics to, how did that shape your investing philosophy? Kate Moore: Absolutely. I think, you know, the best macro investors or able to pull in, you know, different inputs from policy and politics, it’s also really helpful I think to understand human behavior. So if you’re taking an interdisciplinary approach to your academics and your investing life, I think you’re well set up. So in this, I mean I took a bunch of courses on game theory and stuff as a, in my graduate work and understanding payoffs and incentives, doing some work on behavioral economics, all of that combines really well. And my experience too was that the best investors that I worked for over the course of my career also took in all of these different inputs and we’re constantly trying to solve a puzzle, right? It wasn’t just, you know, a two variable puzzle. It was a multi-variable puzzle understanding that every day you wake up and you have to do it anew. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, no, no doubt about it. It’s so funny you mention incentives. Whenever I see a situation that I find completely perplexing and can’t figure it out, what usually leads to the answer is what, what are the incentives that led to this situation? I want you to work backwards from that. So let’s talk a little bit about the strategy and consulting side. You begin your career, Mitchell, Madison and Silver Oak Partners, is that right? Yes. Those two shops. Tell us a little bit about what you did for them and the sort of work and problem solving you did for those firms. Okay, 00:05:34 [Speaker Changed] So both Mitchell Madison, silver Oak no longer exist, right? For the record, Mitchell Madison was formed out of a spinoff of a bunch of McKinsey partners and it was taking kind of a new way, a new approach frankly, to some of the similar types of clients as McKinsey had. And, but it had this very entrepreneurial kind of environment because it was a break off, but it was still really large and global. I did a bunch of like strategy consulting projects, things you would expect, including some cool stuff in the media space just at the time where the internet was becoming popular. And some of these websites like Amazon that we take for granted were getting launched. So I learned a lot about media and e-commerce in those early stages at Mitchell Madison, but Mitchell Madison, for those of you who may recognize it, went through a merger with us Web CKS, which was a technology consulting firm. 00:06:33 All the combined entity got rebranded as March 1st, which was the date that the deal was inked. Kind of a weird marketing decision on that part, but you know, the, the, the business started to change and a number of the partners like broke off and started Silver Oak, which focused on leverage buyout firms. Now here is what was really cool. I wasn’t doing work for let’s say the LBO in master form, but rather like a collection of the companies in the portfolio at the same time trying to find synergies. There were things that are traditional around sourcing, but things that were maybe less traditional around finding strategic combinations. And I had a great opportunity to get exposed to a lot of different industries, you know, from traditional manufacturers to telecom companies, financial services and everything in between. And I have to say, Barry, that experience, you know, working for these kind of small and mid-sized LBO owned companies really set me up well for understanding and investing in a broad array of equities. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk about the investing side. Your next stop is Morgan Stanley, obviously a legendary and giant sell side firm. Tell us your, about your experiences at Morgan Stanley. Yeah, Kate Moore: So how I got to Morgan Stanley investment management is perhaps kind of interesting. So we were just talking about my academic background and I was doing this, you know, political economy degree at University of Chicago and I had had this sort of moment where I realized I wasn’t gonna pursue the PhD. So I, you know, made an appointment with my advisor and I said, you know, professor Harold, I’m not sure I wanna do the PhD. And he starts laughing and we’re sitting in his office, he said, Kate, I’ve been waiting for this conversation for six months. Oh completely. Wow. I said, oh my gosh. Like do you know, do you think I’m screwing up here? He said, no, you’re top of the class. What I do recognize though is because you’ve worked before for a number of years before coming into a PhD program, you have a different skillset and you’re approaching this differently. He’s like, I think you can finish your PhD later. You know, do the master’s and whatever. So I had this in my mind and I, so I started to put out a couple feelers, but I wasn’t really committed to what I would do post, you know, getting my master’s degree. Barry Ritholtz:And this is out of Chicago, rght? 00:08:43 [Speaker Changed] It’s in Chicago. And then a strange thing happened, I was back on the east coast visiting my parents and I got a call from the career services people at University of Chicago. I was still, you know, enrolled in school there just getting my thesis graded. And they said, Hey, we got an incoming call from the Chief Investment officer of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. This guy’s name is Joe McLinden. Joe is looking to add to his macro investing team on the buy side and specifically is looking for candidates that are not MBAs. He wanted people who had this understanding of politics and economics and everything in between. And I said, Hey guys, I’m not interested in going back into that form of finance. I’m gonna do something different. They said, do us this favor and go on the interview. Barry Ritholtz: Just like, just just meet with them. Yeah. 00:09:35 [Speaker Changed] Like let’s put up a good candidate. You kind of meet the criteria. If it’s not your bag, it’s not your bag. And I went and met this team at Morgan Stanley investment management and people who had economics and history and philosophy degrees, but were macro investors. And I was like, okay, A, these people are cool and b, I love how they’re solving the problems. Two weeks later I accepted an offer. I fell into investing Barry. Barry Ritholtz: Wow, that’s that’s really fascinating. And, and you’ve had a breadth of experiences beyond Morgan Stanley. You were at more Capital well regarded hedge funds, bank of America, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan, you spent a lot of time at BlackRock. Tell us what was fun, what did you learn at these other shops? Kate Moore: So I’ve had a really cool career in the sense that I’ve done, you know, a variety of different buy-side, more traditional mutual funds. But even when I was at s Im, we launched the first internal hedge fund. This is before Morgan Stanley bought Front Point and I worked at a big macro hedge fund through the financial crisis, as you mentioned, at more capital that was an adventure. I did a few years on the sell side at B of a Merrill as global equity and emerging market strategist. And then I went to JP Morgan, managed the discretionary multi-asset portfolios for the private bank. Then I spent a, a long time at BlackRock, most of it as a portfolio manager for global allocation, kind of the flagship multi-asset fund. I have to say I love the fact that I have experienced all sides of the investing business and it makes me understand what makes investors tick a lot more than people who just stayed in their lane. Like I get the retail side, the institutional side, what fast money does, what traders do, what fundamental investors do. And I interpret all this sort of sentiment and flow data as part of my process as a result of having this exposure to different parts of the investment management business. Barry Ritholtz: Sounds really, really interesting. So from all of these different backgrounds, what finally brought you to Citi? Kate Moore: Yeah, so I, I was at a bit of an interesting inflection point I would say in my career here I am. I’ve loved being at BlackRock, I really enjoyed the work, but I also recognized I was kind of ready to take the next big step and I could continue to be a portfolio manager at BlackRock and it’s an amazing firm, but I was kind of wondering what it would sort of, what what I should do to take this next step. And I looked around and said where are the areas of growth in the business? And traditional mutual funds we know are not a huge growth area for the business. Even if your performance is exceptional, you know, keeping your assets can be a challenge. And I saw wealth as an area of consistent growth. I think most people would agree on that front for sure. 00:12:22 And, and you know, there’s some growth in alternatives, but it felt like just a different flavor of the stuff I was doing. So I was sort of intrigued by this idea of, of working in wealth, especially because I’ve done a lot of asset allocation and the multi-asset discipline I come from and I love the challenge of helping people grow their money over time. But I hadn’t, I didn’t have like a great idea in my head of what I was gonna do. This was just sort of something that was a seed that was planted and not yet out of the soil if it were. Hmm. And in August of 2024, Andy Seig, who I’d known in the business for like 15 years or so, never worked together directly. But you know, we’d met a number of times, been on panels together, had good cordial relationship. He called me and said, Kate, I have an idea for you. And he had been at Citi for a year then as you know, CEO of wealth. And I thought, okay, this is interesting, but I need to turn it over in my head a little bit. Is this gonna be the right pivot? And ultimately I got so excited Barry because Citi was already in this massive transformation. Andy is a really inspirational leader. I’m not just saying that ’cause he’s my boss, but I think most people on the street will agree. He has a vision he executes and this was a new challenge for me. I’d be flexing different muscles and I thought to myself, for this next big push in my career, I wanna be someplace where I can be entrepreneurial, where I’m gonna be supported by the overall platform where, you know, I can continue to grow out my experience as an investor. And so ultimately I made the tough decision to leave a firm that I loved for a new and exciting challenge. Barry Ritholtz: Safe to say that this shift in career was the biggest inflection point. Kate Moore: It feels like it’s the biggest inflection point in my career, but it also feels cumulative. I don’t know if that makes sense, but perfect sense Barry Ritholtz: I understand exactly what you’re saying. All all of these different elements come together almost like a perfect storm. Yeah. And suddenly now we’re off to the, to the whole nother level. Kate Moore: Yeah. I’ve been building up these experiences over the course of my career and kind of setting me up to take on this new challenge. It does feel the largest in part because I’ve been so concentrated on being an investor over the course of my career. And this is a combination of strategy and, and business leadership and investing. And so as I said, I’m flexing, flexing a bunch of different muscles. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s put some numbers, some flesh on the bone. So the groups you lead the wealth group at at Citi, what’s the assets they’re investing and typically who are the clients? Are they mom and pop investors? Are they institutional? A little of both. Kate Moore: Yeah. So I’ll give you some numbers as of end of 2024 because everything else, of course is in flux in the first part. Barry Ritholtz: We know how that works. Kate Moore: Yeah. I’m in, in the middle of studying for series 65, what will be like my 39th millionth of Barry Ritholtz: But that one you could do in your sleep. It’s not like the seven, which is or the options. Yeah. I forgot which one was the options. That was a giant like wait, I need to learn about gamma, why not? Kate Moore: Totally. I’ve taken the options one too. What I will tell you is the one thing that’s a little bit annoying on the economic section of the series 65 is that, you know, I don’t always agree. Barry Ritholtz: Was gonna say the answers are wrong answer. Once you get past that, the test is really easy. Kate Moore: For Example, it was like, you know, our payrolls a leading lagging or coincident indicator. Very, of course Barry Ritholtz: It’s lagging! Of course or anything but lagging because it’s two months old. Kate Moore: Totally. And like plus or minus 100 Barry Ritholtz: They, they said coincidental, right? Totally. Yeah. It’s just there. I, I remember having an, this is by the way, 30 something years ago, 20 something years ago. I remember calling up and yelling at somebody like, just so you know, I didn’t get any of these answers wrong. And the three you marked wrong, you are wrong. And let me explain why totally. How, how can payrolls, which are a model that uses 1, 2, 3 month old data be anything other than a Kate Moore: Lagging and that get totally restated every two years. Right. And the, the error bands, but the subsequent monthly revisions, I mean by the time you get to the actual number, it’s like half a decade old. It’s nonsense Barry Ritholtz: a hundred percent. Kate Moore: We have to pretend.And yet of course the market moves a lot on payrolls stay and we have to pretend that matters in the moment. Yeah, we have to pretend. Okay, where were we going before? Barry Ritholtz: I have no idea. But I just love the fact that you’re studying for the 65. I know studying in air quotes, Kate Moore: I get to whiz through the equity and hedge fund and everything sort of sections of it. But I have to memorize their answers for economics. Barry Ritholtz: If it, if it wasn’t embarrassing to fail, yeah. I would say you can wing it and you’ll do just fine. I think 70 is a passing, you’ll get like 80 just off the top of your head. But no one wants to go in and fail ’cause it’s embarrassing Kate Moore: No, I’m very like, I, I’ve made my career off of being a perfectionist, you know, in my analysis. That’s so funny. And you know, I do not accept a barely passing grade. I do not expect, I, I accept, you know, index like performance. I’m always seeking alpha and I’m doing my best to do that in the most risk adjusted way, even Barry Ritholtz:In an examination that’s pass fail. Yeah. And we know objectively, logically anything over a 71 is wasted effort. But yeah. But I know where exactly where you coming Kate Moore: From. I can’t sleep at night. I can’t sleep at night if it’s just good enough. And that’s also how I wanna approach things for my clients. Okay, we’re talking about Citi here. And so Citi has about a trillion do, Citi Wealth has a trillion dollars in assets close to like 600, you know, billion of that is in investments and there’s other parts in deposits and loans and things like that. And there are three main segments, right? There’s a traditional kind of private bank, ultra high net worth service, right? There’s Citi Gold, which is mass affluent, and then there is a wealth at work which targets like very specific segments like the law firm population, et cetera. Barry Ritholtz: Makes a lot, makes a ton of sense. Kate Moore: What I will say is Citi as a bank has so many global customers and clients and people with longstanding relationships that haven’t been tapped. You know, there’s, there is an enormous amount of potential to grow the wealth business just from existing Citi customers. And I think as you probably know, half of our business is outside of the US and it is a, it is a, Barry Ritholtz:Is it 50%? It’s fully half, yeah. Wow. That’s amazing. Yeah. Kate Moore: And the Asia business for us and particularly our legacy in China and surrounding areas is incredibly strong. And that was something that was also very attractive to me, to be honest with you. As someone who has been an, an emerging markets investor at times and a student of China, you know, the ability to get really deep into the opportunity to grow wealth in multiple different areas was exciting. 00:19:15 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really fascinating. So before we talk about Citi, let’s start a little bit with your time at BlackRock. You joined them almost a decade ago in 2016 you were chief equity strategist. Tell us a little bit about your initial role and how that played off of what you had been doing previously. 00:19:35 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so I joined BlackRock to be part of the BlackRock Investment Institute, which is kind of the internal macro think tank. And the institute has a couple of different functions. There is a segment that is client facing, but there’s also a big function around bringing together the investors across all the platforms in BlackRock and convening for, you know, forums and symposiums around specific topics. And although I was called Chief equity strategist, I actually sat on the equity platform with all the equity PMs and my job was to be basically embedded in all of the equity portfolios as the macro. My team was the macro resource for them and it was great. And you know, I always knew that I would do that for a little while. They basically said, can you do this and help to sort of change some of the equity culture and to have some macro inputs and then you can kind of figure out where you wanna sit. And ultimately, you know, moving back to a multi-asset fund made the most sense for me because here’s my joke, Barry, like I think of myself as being a macro equity investor, you know, combining macro stuff into equities, but the macro people will say, I’m equity and the equity people will say I’m macro. Yeah, that makes sense. So a multi-asset fund is a, is a good home for me. Huh? 00:20:50 [Speaker Changed] So 2019 you start working with the thematic strategy and portfolio manager group. Yeah. Tell us a little bit about thematics that’s become sort of an alternative to beta in a lot of shops. BlackRock especially. 00:21:06 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Well let me say this, I actually started my career, you know, at Morgan Stanley investment management and the hedge fund that my team launched at MIM was a global thematic hedge fund. This is way back like over 23 years ago at this point. So we were ahead of our times, right? So I’ve actually had this thematic approach, frankly in my investment approach throughout my entire career. And it’s just now becoming really popular to call everything a thematic. So lemme say this, I think there are three ways at this time to approach thematics, three different flavors if you will. The first is this kind of like long duration slow bleed thematic. Like eventually we are going to have reduce the amount of plastics in all of our goods. And so we wanna lean into companies that are investing in that transition. You 00:22:01 [Speaker Changed] Don’t think microplastics accumulating in your lungs and bloodstream is a bad thing. 00:22:06 [Speaker Changed] It is definitely a bad thing. I wonder if I’m a little bit cooked when it comes to that already. But this is kind of a set it and forget it strategy, right? Where you identify companies that are making these changes or facilitating the changes and you buy a basket of them and you or an ETF that invests ’em and then you just set it. The second type of thematics is what I would call like discontinuous change, catalyst driven thematics. And these are more tactical, like, you know, it could be a couple quarters, it could be up to a year or two or even longer. But this is kind of a more actively managed way to approach thematics, right? Where, so you identify the idea, you identify the catalysts, you identify the players, and actually there’s more of a rotation in the names and the sizing of that expression in the thematic. That’s really exciting. It’s also hard because sometimes you look around and say, I don’t see a ton of catalysts here. There’s nothing really jumping out. You 00:23:02 [Speaker Changed] Gotta get the theme, right? The asset class, right? And the timing right 00:23:05 [Speaker Changed] And the sizing, you know, within that, right? And so that’s not like by 40 companies that are thinking about microplastics. It is like four to eight names, a more concentrated expression around a theme. You’re taking some idiosyncratic risk and you are continuing to to invest around that. And then the third type of thematic investing, I would say is really business cycle thematic. And a lot of people talk about this, you know, today there’s a, you know, where are we in the cycle? What are the companies sectors or qualities that perform well in that part of the cycle? I’m thematically investing in inflation beneficiaries, et cetera. And I’ve always liked to do those two, kind of number two and number three together, which is the catalyst driven and the business cycle. And I think that together makes a nice portfolio. 00:23:54 [Speaker Changed] You know, I recall back in the day when we were talking about sort of thematic cycle investing, business cycle investing, it was used to go by the name sector rotation. Yeah. I don’t know if anybody still does that sort of stuff anymore, it 00:24:09 [Speaker Changed] Seems like, or the investment clock. Do you remember the investment clock? Sure, sure. Absolutely. Everyone had an investment clock, which was like this two dimensional representation of which sectors or which maybe style factors. Once that became part of our lexicon performed well in different macro environments, 00:24:26 [Speaker Changed] It was always sort of a sine wave. And here’s where we are in this sector here in the sector there. Yeah. If it only were, were that easy. 00:24:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. You know, I, I won’t call out names, but I know some folks that like to chart where we are, which quadrant we’re in, right. You know, on a regular basis. And instead of this nice round circle or an oval, you know, it’s very sort of spastic point to point, to point to point because the macro data is moving so quickly and the positioning data, which also indicates, you know, investor risk, appetite changes so rapidly that we jump from one quadrant to the other sometimes month to month. 00:25:05 [Speaker Changed] So, so you mentioned removing plastic from the food supply or wherever. Yeah. What other trends have you looked at? Deglobalization, decarbonization ai. What gets you excited these days? 00:25:18 [Speaker Changed] Oh wait, you just said a hot button word for me, which is deglobalization. And let me just say I don’t believe in deglobalization. 00:25:24 [Speaker Changed] I’m with you, but I want to hear your reasons why. 00:25:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I don’t believe in deglobalization because even if, let’s say hypothetically the US and China continue to separate and by hypothetical I was making a joke for all the listeners, of course the US and China are gonna continue to separate. That doesn’t mean the relationships between each of these countries and other trading partners or allies is not gonna deepen, right? Maybe we call it re globalization instead of de-globalization, but a, a shifting of some other relationships. But I have spent a lot of my time, like a lot of folks frankly, looking at themes in and around technology. I mentioned the microplastics. It’s actually not a theme I’ve invested in. The only couple companies I’ve really seen who are geared towards that are private. And so it’s harder to access. But around technology, you know, a few areas I’ve been pretty excited about for a good considerable amount of time has been, you know, have been in, in software. 00:26:20 And one of those areas is cybersecurity. This was a major theme for me in the portfolio at Global allocation at BlackRock. And basically every time I was thinking that I’d want to either shift out of the theme or reduce it, there was another event on the horizon or something happening that led to increased spend in this space. I’ve now come to believe that investment in, in security software is existential for companies, right? And while there’s room to rotate, you know, names based on capabilities, et cetera, I believe it’s a, it’s a core part of a portfolio 00:26:54 [Speaker Changed] Longstanding secular trend that’s gonna be ongoing. 00:26:57 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. But I first put on this investment in January of 2020 Okay. When I was at BlackRock and that was before the pandemic and it was basically based on geopolitical risk and of course the pandemic that increased the risk from all this data for many different companies. So we saw big up uptick in spends. As I said, it was a, it’s been a rolling series of catalysts over the last five and a half years and makes it more of a secular theme than a, a shorter term catalyst driven theme. So. 00:27:25 [Speaker Changed] So let’s drill down a little bit to your core investment philosophy. You’ve mentioned thematics, you’ve mentioned pursuing Alpha. Tell us what is Kate Moore’s investment philosophy? 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think it’s really important to have three pillars to your decision making and one pillar that’s off to the side that’s controversial. So I think you have to start with a macro view. I think you need to understand politics policy, the major economic data you need to understand government behaviors. ’cause so much of that dictates the environment for different industries. And some people just sort of brush it off. By the way, I love my equity colleagues and friends, but nothing makes the hair on the back of my neck go up more and kind of me bristle than to hear. I don’t pay attention to macro because I just pick good companies. Well good, you’ll be out of business. You don’t have a choice in this environment. You can’t set it and forget it for the next three years and not focus on what’s happening in the business cycle and policy and how that may impact the interest and desire to own your asset class. 00:28:29 So I think macro is critical and a good starting point. I also like to get into the fundamentals of things, right? Like where are the fundamental thematically, like who’s growing, what technology has come out, where do we think about, you know, changes in consumer behavior, changes in supply chains, and where are the real kind of fundamental opportunities? What are the companies doing? Well I think that’s not controversial either, but with the third stage, and it’s really important to me, I mean it’s grown in importance over the course of my career is the positioning, sentiment and technicals. And this has become really, really, really important for your, for defining your entry and exit points, even if you are a long-term investor because the markets move really quickly and you need to be really thoughtful about how you enter and exit. So I pay attention to flows, hedge fund, mutual fund positioning, introduction of new instruments, you know, a million things we kind of look at at our dashboard. And then this is the one I was saying the pillar off to the side valuation is a nice to know, but it is not a driving force of my investment process. And people might kind of cringe when I say that, you 00:29:40 [Speaker Changed] Know, know what, let me jump in here and, and I won’t explore that ’cause I don’t disagree with any of that. People kind of forget that bull markets that run 10, 20 years, valuations tend to start on the lower end and they tend to end on the higher end. But if you decide, oh, we’re above the average valuation of the past cycle, you’re missing a lot of upside, aren’t you? 00:30:06 [Speaker Changed] Ton of upside. Well there’s also this assumption that that underpins this view on valuations. That there is some sort of mean reversion, right? 00:30:13 [Speaker Changed] Tomorrow we’re gonna snap at, look at the cape is my favorite example of that. Yeah, the Schiller cyclically adjusted PE ratio. You would’ve been out like 90% since 1990. A hundred. Yeah. If you followed that, it’s, it’s kind of wild. 00:30:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, for sure. You would absolutely have not taken advantage of an incredible run in equities. Like, just to make this point and underscore it, I say evaluation is a starting point for your investment decision, what you’re screening for and entry and exit points. You would never own US tech and you would be long Russia, you know, and anyone who wants to take that trade, God bless, but you’ll be out of business, right? 00:30:50 [Speaker Changed] Russia’s been cheap, but some stocks are cheap for a reason. 00:30:54 [Speaker Changed] They are European banks cheap for reason. And we know that kind of over the medium term, this I’ll define as kind of three years, you know, stocks can stay quote unquote expensive or the way I like to say it be valued at a higher end of the market range because they are superior businesses and they can stay at those levels for multiple years, sometimes much longer and continue to rerate and stuff can look like it’s a discount to the rest of the market, but be structurally impaired and therefore deserve the discount. The other problem I have when people do these kind of like mean reversion, you know, valuation trades as they say like, oh we need to go back to some historical period where s and p was at 14 times, right? Why? I mean the market composition from a sector perspective completely different. The balance sheets of these companies completely different. The cash profiles and free cash generation of these companies completely different. The regulatory environment, the politics, the behavior, the market technicals, I can go on and on and on. It is literally the laziest piece of analysis I have ever seen. 00:32:04 [Speaker Changed] When when you look at last century companies like US Steel or even General Motors, you know, the expression was men in material, they need tons of capital giant factories today, two people with a laptop and Amazon web servers. You could, you could do as much business as any startup from any decade previously. 00:32:27 [Speaker Changed] Totally. I mean another example I like to use, like near and dear to our hearts in terms of the investment landscape is, you know, how many analysts do I really need to cover all different sorts of sectors? You know? And it, there was a time where I needed everyone to be an expert in a different industry or a different sector and to be very siloed and and deeply specialized. But right now I can be in a meeting sitting across the table from A CEO or CFO and they may be talking about a business that I only know 50% about, right? And I, in real time, I can use my AI tools, I can pull up what their competitors have said in recent earnings calls or you know, in the social media, I can look up terminology, I can pull up data. I am a hundred times more informed. I don’t need to be briefed for three hours from an analyst before I walk into that meeting. You know, just by understanding the types of questions to ask and having this data at my fingertips, I’m a faster and better investor. 00:33:25 [Speaker Changed] So here’s the challenge, and we could talk about AI as a theme in a little bit, but the challenge is you’ve gone through that whole process over the past 10, 20 years where you’ve, you know, done the reps put in the heavy lifting. Yeah. How is the next generation going to become the Kate Moore in 25 years if they don’t get to go through that process? And AI seems to, the phrase I heard recently was removing the bottom rung on the career ladder. Is this, is this a genuine concern? 00:33:59 [Speaker Changed] It is somewhat of a concern and I think it’s more of a concern for, for kids who are going through school and are incredibly specialized about what they’re studying. And this is kind of a flag frankly, I would say to people, you don’t wanna just take courses in one discipline. Your job as an undergrad. And I would also argue even in grad school, even in MBA program, is to learn how to think and learn how to ask questions to get exposed to as many different disciplines as possible. So I tell like young folks, like you gotta study philosophy, you should also study things like art history because there’s context behind it. You should study things like you know, hard sciences because you know, it gives you a discipline in terms of the way that you’re thinking you should take a music theory class. I mean do all of this. You want your brain to be flexible and compliant. You want to be able to approach the problem by using these tools in unique ways. And people who are only point and shoot, only have one specific way of approaching an investment problem are often wrong. 00:35:04 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really, really interesting. So you were brought to Citi specifically to focus on the wealth business there. What’s your strategy for breathing life into that space? 00:35:18 [Speaker Changed] So I think there are a couple things. We have a lot of amazing raw material at at Citi in terms of human capital and of course our clients. But thinking about how to invest in a different way than perhaps my other wealth competitors invest is, is one of the greatest challenges and opportunities. And here’s what I will say, you know, I want to examine the way that we’re approaching discretionary multi-asset class asset allocation products, right? Just to sort of set it and forget it. Here’s your stock bonds cash, I’m not sure is gonna be the right path moving forward. I mean, we want to think about what is the right combination of both asset class and factor exposures for, for clients in different risk profiles and how do we implement in, in an interesting way in that space. So it’s not just like, hey we have a, you know, large cap stock fund or, and we have a, you know, mid, mid duration bond fund and this is what we’re kind kind of combining together. This is really about, you know, what are the best expressions of each of those things? How much of it should be beta? How much of it should be alpha seeking? Whether it’s you know, sector specific or thematic. What is the best implementation in alternatives? And particularly as we get more liquid alternatives available, you know, that sort of diversification in a portfolio is going to be kind of democratized and we’re gonna see more and more of our clients across risk spectrum be able to access that. So, 00:36:51 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk about the opportunities in the wealth business. What’s driving the growth here? Is it just the amount of capital that’s sloshing around? How big are demographics, the move towards alternatives? There’s so many different cross currents going on that make that space so attractive. What do you see as the key drivers? 00:37:12 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, there’s a bunch of different drivers, Barry. I’d say, you know, first of all there’s been an enormous amount of wealth created. We know over the last, you know, 10 years, it’s longer than that. But let’s just say in the last 10 years 00:37:23 [Speaker Changed] Post-financial crisis. 00:37:24 [Speaker Changed] Post-financial crisis, great 15 00:37:25 [Speaker Changed] Year run. 00:37:26 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. And big concentrations of wealth and frankly a lot of very wealthy families have held a lot of these, this wealth in cash, you know, or in cash equivalents or have reinvested in their business. I think there’s now an understanding that they wanna diversify. So the investment opportunity set for all this wealth creation is huge. I’d say there’s another trend, and I’m sure people have talked about this before with you, which is like the transfer of wealth that’s gonna happen from the b the boomer generation to my generation, and then ultimately to our, you know, younger generation. And the values and the interests on the investing side change from generation to generation. You know, the types of risk clients wanna take, the types of like bespoke opportunities and private stuff that they wanna do. Maybe it’s around, you know, environmental social governance stuff. Maybe it’s around specific geographies, mission aligned. I mean I think that the flavor of investing is changing, which also makes us super exciting. And then finally I would say can, you know, the, the breadth of investment instruments that are available to individual investors and into wealthy families is actually really exciting because you can do cooler things than just a 60 40 portfolio, which was kind of the way wealth businesses ran in the past. 00:38:46 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. So you had mentioned the role of behavioral finance in some of your education and background. You were at University of Chicago, which has become a hotbed of behavioral finance. Dick Thaler. Yeah. He’s recipient of the Nobel. Tell us how you think about behavioral economics in your day job. How do you help clients steer through some of this year as a perfect example, a lot of volatility, a lot of sterman, drang, and here we are above where we were before liberation day. How do you guide people through that? 00:39:21 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, this is such a tough one, Barry, because you know, this is where understanding kind of the positioning, the technicals and the biases really differentiate a good investor from maybe a less good investor. One of the things I try and pay close attention to are all of these sentiment indicators and like, you know, the dashboard for sentiment indicators continues to change, right? Sometimes we look at, you know, historic filings, but we know that mutual funds and hedge funds change their positions really quickly. Sometimes we look at the volume and the flow. I like to pay attention to more kind of third party and, you know, coincident things like what, what’s being discussed in different social media or on different message boards or whatever. And to just try and understand what’s capturing the attention and energy from different client segments. But I also pay really close attention to frankly, how the market responds to different types of news. And that gives you a good sense. You gotta have your finger on that pulse. You know, I, I learned this from someone named Ben Hunt, who you may be familiar with. Of course, 00:40:32 [Speaker Changed] You’re right. Epsilon theory. 00:40:33 [Speaker Changed] Epsilon theory. So I learned this from Ben years ago, but he said, you know, number one, the first order to getting things right is like having a good forecast, right? Let’s just say you have a forecast for stock earnings. The second order is to understand what consensus thinks, right? And comparing your number against that, right? But to get it really right in the market, you need to understand what consensus thinks. Consensus thinks 00:40:59 [Speaker Changed] It’s a Kane’s beauty contest. 00:41:02 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. And, but, but kind of instilling that in my team is really important because it’s like, great, I’m so glad you think we’re gonna have $263 of s and p earnings this year. If consensus actually thinks it’s 2 67, we should know that too. But if the printed number is 2 67 but everyone’s just dragging their feet on cutting the numbers and they’re actually at 2 55, that makes a difference in terms of how people take risk and respond to different news. And so, you know, kind of, of putting all these pieces together, doing the work, understanding what like written or published consensus is and then getting all these kind of sentiment inputs to really evaluate what is the whisper real number versus what’s published. 00:41:46 [Speaker Changed] So let me push back slightly on sentiment ’cause I want to get your take on this. So my experience generally has been most day-to-day sentiment is kind of noisy and it really matters when it hits an extreme. At least that’s a trader’s perspective. But the thing I really wanna push back on has been the University of Michigan. Yeah. Consumer sentiment data, which over the past couple of years it’s been worse than the financial crisis, worse than the beginning of the pandemic, worse than the the 2001 September 11th attacks or the.com implosion worse than the 87 crash. How do we figure out what’s going on in sentiment where it seems to have just detached from consumer behavior, Hey, everything is terrible, but we’re going out and spending totally, 00:42:38 [Speaker Changed] We’re still going out to restaurants even though we think the world is ending, right? Yeah, no, you’re absolutely right. So any single sentiment indicator or survey needs to be discounted, right? We need to come combine all these things and look at it kind of on a moving average of a number of prints. Another one that kind of flagged for me was the conference board confidence, which hit the lowest levels from like September of 2011, you know, last month. And that was a crazy number, right? Because it, September of 2011, we had just gone through this debt fiasco. We were going to Operation Twist, you know, there was like 00:43:11 [Speaker Changed] Post flash crash, it had gotten even crazy. 00:43:14 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. So, you know, that, that seemed really disconnected from reality. So sometimes you have to discount all of these things, but your point is well taken. There has been a generalized sentiment deterioration. Another one I look at is the, what is now the Richmond Fed, but historically had been the Duke Fuqua CFO survey. And you’ve seen over the past couple years this massive decoupling between expectations for own company over the next six months where the CFOs are going, like things are pretty good actually. And expectations for the economy where they’re like, the economy’s in trouble. 00:43:46 [Speaker Changed] It’s so funny you bring that up ’cause well first I had Tom barking and not too long ago, but second, we see that everywhere my congressman’s okay, but the rest of Congress thinks totally my financial circumstances seem to be pretty good, but we think the economy is going lower. Like that exact sort of sentiment split. What do you imagine is driving people to think, Hey, things aren’t that bad for me, but everywhere else it stinks. 00:44:14 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I, hmm, this is tough one, but I, I honestly think the news flow, how media portrays recent events, the echo chamber on social media, the fact that people are not getting a broad based view. Do you see all these, you know, traditional news programs now that are trying to dedicate one night a week or whatever the heck it is to the good news, right? They’re 00:44:36 [Speaker Changed] Is that true? That’s, 00:44:37 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. It’s like, that’s funny. There’s a, there’s a, a local channel I’ve watched that it will do one good story after they’ve just reported a bunch of like murders and you know, everything for the previous 25 minutes. The last story is like, they’re trying to leave you on a positive note, huh? I’m mean like, okay, but the skew is definitely really negative. 00:44:55 [Speaker Changed] If it, if it bleeds it leads, that’s always been the news thing. Yeah. 00:44:58 [Speaker Changed] Really, really fascinating. But now people are consuming more of that 00:45:01 [Speaker Changed] And so I think, I think you’re definitely onto something. But 00:45:04 [Speaker Changed] So we, yeah, we do maybe need to z score the sentiment right now, let’s just put it that way. We, we have to adjust for this declining overall sentiment. But when I’m talking about sentiment, I also like, I’m trying to infer sentiment from price reactions to different news, right? And that might be a better gauge in some of these surveys where people can say, you know, the sky is falling but then just book a carnival cruise, right? Like, you know the, and you know, if a stock puts up pretty good numbers in terms of earnings but doesn’t beat by huge margin and falls 15%, you can tell that like people are at the edge, right? And so, you know, you have to kind of correct your own equity exposure for that type of behavior, huh. But your point’s well taken on you mish and on, you know, all of these other surveys, there’s been a generalized decline. We have to correct for that. 00:45:52 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. So let’s talk a little bit about today’s market environment. 2025 has been kind of a volatile wacky year. What, what’s your current macro view on the global economy? What’s going on in markets? The fed yield inflation, tariffs, it all seems to be kind of tumbling together at once. 00:46:15 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I have to say 2025 has been a tough year for anyone and it’s also been a tough year candidly for me to start a new job. I like to say that every time I start a new job there’s some big volatility event. This one might be the biggest and frankly totally self-induced as opposed to some kind of exogenous or external shock. So it’s been really difficult to navigate through this market and yet, you know, there are some things we can still anchor to paying attention to what companies are saying about their businesses. This kind of sort of sentiment stuff we were talking about a moment ago. Looking at the long-term trends, this all leads us to say like okay, we can still be invested. But I am deeply worried Barry about what’s gonna happen to the economy over the summer and and into the beginning of 2026. 00:47:05 We know that companies have been operating more or less BAU business as usual despite all of the shocks on headlines around tariffs and consumers, you know, may have pulled forward some demand, but they’re also kind of operating BAU for the most part. There’s not been a significant change. And yet we know that the introduction of these tariffs and the risk aversion that’s a result of these tariffs and changes in policy and changes in expectations for global supply chains is going to lead to some weakness and activity. The thing I just wanna point out is like going into the end of 2024, in the beginning of 25, I was also like a little worried frankly that the economy was slowing not catastrophically, not recession style, but there were enough cracks across the consumer and enough indications from companies to basically suggest like this was not gonna be an accelerating year even before these policy shocks. 00:48:01 And now I think despite some adjustments, you know, immediately after the tariff announcements, companies don’t have an incentive to do a bunch of different things. And that is engage in real CapEx, they’ll spend what they need to to stay in business or to maintain or things that are absolutely necessary, but they’re gonna prioritize expansionary CapEx and acquisitions I think are off the table. Number two on the labor market. We’ve heard a lot of people talk about it being frozen. Yes there’s still some hiring, but when you look at kind of the composition of the hiring, it’s not as exciting as it might have otherwise been in a, you know, policy, you risk free economy and I think companies have an incentive to kind of keep their labor force where it is without really expanding. ’cause they don’t know if that’s gonna make sense for margins and stuff going forward. 00:48:51 And then the third thing I would say is, you know, companies need to ask themselves what should my supply chain, what should my corporate relationships look like over the course of, you know, the next couple years? Because the truth of the matter is if they have to realign ’em, it will be a significant cost. It will take a ton of time and take a ton of energy. And yet if there might be a policy shift either at the midterms or under a new administration, the incentive to make these multi-year investments as low. So I get this sort of paralysis that’s playing out in terms of the market in, in terms of corporate behavior. And so I’m a little, I wouldn’t say worried about a recession, but concerned about much slower activity in the second half of the year. 00:49:35 [Speaker Changed] So that raises so many different issues. We keep hearing from CFOs, CEOs about the lack of clarity. If you don’t know what the policy’s gonna be, how do you relocate manufacturing plan a headquarter? How do you plan to do any sort of expansionary hiring? So I’m completely with you that hey, this seems to be this self-inflicted wound that’s preventing the economy from accelerating and yet despite all that the economy seems to be incredibly resilient and not taking too big of a hit from all of these on again off again tariffs. Does that just mean that this administration inherited a really robust economy? 00:50:23 [Speaker Changed] Yes, and I think there’s another element to it. I do think this administration, you know, inherited a resilient economy. One that was perhaps underappreciated over the last couple years because not everyone was feeling that resilience in the same way or wealth creation wasn’t as broad as some would’ve liked. Okay. But I think there’s another element to this too, and this goes a little bit into kind of corporate behavior and how investors react to corporate decisions. Which is, you know, if a company pulls back prematurely, let’s say they shed a bunch of workforce or they cut a lot of CapEx and they really hunker down for a bad economic environment and that doesn’t actually show up for multiple quarters and they la 00:51:08 [Speaker Changed] Kinda like the past few years. Yeah. Everybody forecasting recessions that never came 00:51:12 [Speaker Changed] And they lag their peer group and they look weak relative to the rest of the industry. Wow. That, that makes people lose confidence in that management team. Hmm. So there’s almost an incentive for management teams to maybe have contingency plans to talk about that with their board and the rest of their leadership, but not necessarily communicate that with the investment community and keep operating with only a tiny bit of defensive action because there’s gonna be a penalty on their stock price and frankly in the confidence people have in the management team, if it looks like they’re being too emotional and reactionary. 00:51:48 [Speaker Changed] This sounds like the game theory work you did at UFC Yeah is coming into the 00:51:52 [Speaker Changed] Before a a hundred percent that that it plays a huge part in the way I think about this. So you know, no company has an incentive to talk about how concerned they actually are publicly because the first one that does it will be penalized. 00:52:05 [Speaker Changed] Huh. That’s interesting. And, and since you work at a giant bank, we’ve seen bank earnings that are pretty strong across the board. Yeah. That’s kind of unexpected. Tell us a little bit about what does that mean in light of this environment? Relatively high rates really just more normalized than what we’ve seen in the prior two decades. What’s going on in the banking sector? 00:52:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, well I can talk a little bit about Citi because we’ve had some pretty awesome operating performance and there are a couple things really driving that. Of course, you know, there’s been a real focus in terms of cost and expense. This is not just Citi, this is across the board at major financial institutions and frankly investment investors really love this. They want to see that discipline continue. Number two, like the mix shift has actually contributed to earnings. And I think as you well know, you know, wealth has been a huge driver for many of the diversified financial services companies. I expect it con will continue and I’m looking forward to wealth being an even bigger driver for Citi over the next couple years. And then I think there’s a, you know, another element too, which is that the speed and sort of the, the facility that management has in toggling between different types of business for different parts of the cycle has significantly improved relative to how people think about banks 15 years ago. So we were talking about valuations earlier and you know, financial services and kind of banks more specifically kind of dragged down overall market multiples when they were a huge part of the market cap for the US large cap indices in the past. 00:53:39 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk a little bit about soft data. It’s kind of been negative when we’re talking about sentiment and things like that. This really hasn’t translated into the hard data yet. Tell us what you’re looking at in that space. 00:53:54 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, of course. I mean, I’m shaking my head as you say that ’cause it’s absolutely right. The soft data into hard data in a normal period, you know, gets translated in in over inconsistent time period. So there’s not like a map that says like, hey, the soft data does x and then three quarters later or one month later it translates into something in the market or some other hard data and economic activity. So it’s always a bit of an art interpreting the soft data into the hard data. And yet it’s really important to, to pay attention because it may impact the marginal decision. Right now the soft data has went from catastrophic post the April 2nd to tariff announcements to really awful, to maybe a hair better, but still pretty bummed out. And as we’ve talked about, the economic data has stayed somewhat resilient. That doesn’t mean that the economic data will never show weakness. And again, I’m expecting some soft pockets throughout the second half of the year. Not recessionary, but kind of like sub 2% sub one point half percent growth. I think we should buckle down for, and that’s where I expect more durable earning stories. Secular growth stories will outperform the rest of the market. 00:55:06 [Speaker Changed] So it sounds like there are a couple of catalysts in the pipeline and you’re just waiting to see which direction the majority of these go. Tell us a little bit about what you see is upside and downsized. 00:55:18 [Speaker Changed] Catalysts. Okay. So around tariffs, any given day that we’d be having this discussion, there would be, there’s a new set of news. One thing I do know is that we have a series of deadlines over the course of the summer where people are hoping for some level of resolution. And the way I say talk about this, Barry, is this, is that we may be past peak tar of shock, but we are nowhere close to peak tariff pain. We don’t really know how bad it’s going to be quite yet. And this is why of course companies have been reluctant to significantly change their guidance and their earnings revision ratios have looked, you know, better than some people expected. Here’s what I will say. Even if the reciprocal tariffs don’t hold up and they end up going to the Supreme Court and that’s a decision, the sectoral tariffs which take longer to implement are much stickier and frankly have much long larger. 00:56:09 [Speaker Changed] When you say sectoral like North America Canon? 00:56:12 [Speaker Changed] No, like semis. 00:56:14 [Speaker Changed] Oh, okay. Gotcha. Pharma, 00:56:16 [Speaker Changed] Copper, steel, all of these sectoral tariffs are much stickier and have much greater potential impact than the country to country bilateral reciprocal tariffs. 00:56:28 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s so interesting you mentioned that someone was from a biomedical device company was having a conversation with me. It’s like I don’t understand an iPhone is exempt from China tariffs, but the pacemakers we make that save people’s lives are not, and if we have to relocate this to wherever, to Taiwan, to Vietnam, to Canada, right? The FDA process starts over and it’ll be eight years. So for about half a decade or so, as the the Chinese manufacturer at pacemakers sell off, but before the new ones come online, there’s not gonna be enough pacemakers 00:57:07 [Speaker Changed] Right there. We have a real risk of some of these important raw materials and these important consumer goods and these important medical goods, you know, not being adequately supplied. And so we have to really watch this. So I, so I will say this, that the tariff side is not gonna be resolved over the course of the summer and because it’s gonna bleed out for longer, we may have slower growth, but not catastrophic. But eventually we’ll have some really big sectoral consumer and business impacts. 00:57:36 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really, really interesting. You mentioned some of the news stories and how things are affecting sentiment. How do you see the role of narratives driving market responses? It seems like there are different stories for different asset classes every other week. 00:57:54 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. The narrative changes. It sometimes it feels like on 30 minute increments, it, you know, it used to be you’d have a couple weeks of a narrative taking hold. I know many people think about this, but the market can really only focus on one thing at a time, one major narrative at a time. You know, and that’s where you end up seeing the bulk of the price movement. For example, is it around tariffs? Is it around inflation data? Is it around fed expectations? Is it around the technology conflict between the US and China? Is it around some geopolitical shock? You know, it’s, but it’s not gonna be all of those things at once, even though I would argue all of those things are happening concurrently. And I think the market has become even more short attention span if we can, you know, personify it here. And as a result, the narratives are shifting very quickly. This is why it’s really important to, when you’re thinking about portfolio construction, to anchor on the right asset class and factor exposures, to layer it with more sort of medium term thematic alpha generating ideas and then offer some ballast to the portfolio, either in less correlated assets or in expressions of the asset class or factor that that has a different duration. So, 00:59:07 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk about some of the quote unquote less correlated asset classes. There has been a giant move into alternatives, most especially private credit, private equity. What do you see in that space? How is that evolving over the next five to 10 years? 00:59:25 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, let me answer that second part first. I think the evolution of this, this broad bucket of alternatives is gonna be towards more liquid expressions. 00:59:34 [Speaker Changed] More liquid, yes. 00:59:36 [Speaker Changed] Or at least more vehicles that allow for individual investors and, you know, family offices and things like that to invest in these types of vehicles. Right? You don’t have to set it and forget it for like 10 years. I think there’s gonna be a lot of demand just as we’ve seen say traditional mutual fund transfer into ETFs, active ETFs, but be more kind of combined vehicles. The challenge I think is that there’s been so much money, and we know this, we’ve got great data on this chasing this like a small number of deals. And it has become so popular to think about alternatives as an asset class that the returns that some of these strategies have been able to achieve in the past, I think are much more challenged in the future. 01:00:21 [Speaker Changed] Ha Haven’t we seen that in sort of venture capital land? Absolutely. Back in the absolutely the eighties and nineties VC numbers were spectacular. And post.com implosion. Yeah. Not only you have more companies staying private for longer, it just seems like a ton of low hanging fruit were picked, you know, decades ago. Yeah. 01:00:39 [Speaker Changed] The narrative is like 85% of US companies are actually still private. And so it’s really important to have all these vehicles to access them on the equity on the credit side. I hear that. But there’s certain major differences. Of course, if you’re a private company, you may continue to need different types of funding. You don’t have to disclose to your shareholders on a regular basis, of course, that you don’t have to deal with the, the stock price fluctuation and, and all of that, what that might mean for your employees who are paid and, and shares. But it also creates a complicated environment where when you don’t have to disclose, when you don’t have to report, you know, you may make a different set of decisions. Some of that might be good for the long term and some of it may be just like a poor allocation of capital. ’cause no one’s calling you out on it because the capital’s already locked in. So it’s, I would say this 85% of companies that are still private, that the alternative managers are exciting about, about giving you exposure to not all of them are the same quality as the, you know, publicly available, you know, large cap, mega cap companies. 01:01:46 [Speaker Changed] Makes a lot of sense. I want to get to my favorite questions. Okay. But before I do that, I gotta throw you at least one curve ball. You are on the resource council for the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. Yeah. Tell us about that. Does 01:01:59 [Speaker Changed] That sound random to you, 01:02:00 [Speaker Changed] Barry? Yeah, it sounds totally ra I know you’re a former ski bum. I am. So maybe there’s some relationship with that. Yeah, I 01:02:08 [Speaker Changed] Actually split my time between New York City and Jackson Hole. So I spent a lot of time in the Jackson community. I’m super passionate about the conservation and nature programs at Grand Teton National Park. And I’ve been on the Resource council now for about three years. It is a kind of sub-board of the, of the board of the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. And we do some really amazing things. One of the things I’m most passionate about are some of these wildlife programs and the money that we raise specifically for research that benefits some of the biologists in the park and also that, you know, all of the visitors to the park can take advantage of. My favorite thing to do every summer, Barry is the Wolf Watch, which we do some, some days during August, we’ll go up with a biologist to this bluff and we will watch a, a pack that lives in Grand Teton National Park and learn all about wolf habitats behaviors and changes in their patterns. 01:03:04 [Speaker Changed] So, so this is part of the National Park system, but yet there’s a private foundation that helps raise assets and manage resources for the park. Tell us a little bit about that 01:03:15 [Speaker Changed] Structure. Yeah, actually, almost all the national parks have friends groups. And this Grant Teton National Park Foundation is the friends group for Grand Teton National Park. We are a very large and successful one and we’ve really helped to partner with the park on everything from like visitor centers to, you know, accessible options to the, to rivers, to redoing the trail system, to sponsoring some of the biologists, et cetera. The park is run by the park, but the superintendent and the CEO Grant Teton National Park Foundation are close partners. And I like to think, yeah, we’re the best friends group out there. 01:03:47 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really, really quite fascinating. Let’s jump to our favorite questions ’cause I only, I know I only have you for a few more moments. We’ll, we’ll make this our speed round. Starting with what’s keeping you entertained these days? What are you watching or listening to? 01:04:03 [Speaker Changed] Okay, so I don’t watch television at all very infrequently. 01:04:07 [Speaker Changed] No Netflix, no prime, no Apple tv, none of that. 01:04:10 [Speaker Changed] It’s not really my jam. Wow, 01:04:12 [Speaker Changed] That’s really 01:04:13 [Speaker Changed] Interesting. Yeah, it’s not really my jam. I do watch like things, sometimes a news magazine or whatever, but for the most part I’m just an avid reader and I like to spend my time when I’m not working, reading, playing sports, listening to music, and I’m an amateur artist, so I’ve been watching screens after being in front of screens all day long is unappealing to me. 01:04:35 [Speaker Changed] Can I tell you that sounds shockingly healthy. 01:04:39 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I try to be shockingly healthy. I also try to put my devices down and be focused on other things because I get enough screen time during the day. 01:04:46 [Speaker Changed] I, I totally get it. Tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 01:04:52 [Speaker Changed] I don’t know that I had a lot of official mentors. I will tell you, I had more peer mentors, if that makes sense. You know, growing up in the business, I, I was often the only woman in the room, or the only woman on the investment committee. And I built really strong peer relationships with other investors of similar levels around the street. And there are a lot of people who’ve helped to influence my way of thinking or have challenged me. But yeah, I mean, I try and be a mentor to as many, especially young women as I can in the business since I didn’t have that available to me at the time. But I wish I had a long list of mentors, but I would say it’s, it’s more my peer group that I’ve really linked arms with and grown with that I think of as kind of playing that role for me in my career. 01:05:37 [Speaker Changed] Huh, interesting. So you mentioned you read a lot. Let’s talk about books. Yeah. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 01:05:44 [Speaker Changed] Okay. I’m a giant sci-fi in fantasy nerd. 01:05:47 [Speaker Changed] Oh boy. Were you talking to the right person? 01:05:49 [Speaker Changed] I mean, so on this theme of not watching screens after I work, I like to really escape, like deep in escape after a long day of staring at numbers and analyzing, you know, economics. So here’s what I will say. I am in an amazing series right now, the Murder Bot series by Martha Wells. I know it’s been made into a series. I will not watch it because it will ruin the entire vision. 01:06:15 [Speaker Changed] It’s on Apple tv. It’s gotten mixed reviews so far. Yeah, so far. But I have that in my queue, the first murder box. 01:06:22 [Speaker Changed] Oh, it’s so good. It’s amazing. And you know, thinking about this intersection between bots and AI and the future, and there’s a lot of inner dialogue in there that I don’t think will translate well into a series. But anyway, neither here nor there. So I love to read that before I, I’m on book six now. Before I started that I read the latest from Town of French, which is called the Searcher and, and that and the Hunters two books together, it takes place in Ireland. She’s one of my favorite contemporary fiction authors. It’s like, these are mysteries. And so I love that. And yeah, I pretty much gobble up anything that will make it onto the Hugo or Nebula shortlist. Right. And try and geek out as much as possible. 01:07:05 [Speaker Changed] I had no idea you were a geek. Any non-fiction that that crosses your transom? 01:07:10 [Speaker Changed] Well, the one that’s really kind of stood out to me, and it was recommended by a former colleague of mine from BlackRock is 4,000 weeks. 01:07:17 [Speaker Changed] So good. 01:07:18 [Speaker Changed] So good. And as someone who’s tried to optimize my life many times in the past, but have had a couple he health setbacks and things like that, this was a great reminder that getting through the to to-do list is not the goal. 01:07:31 [Speaker Changed] Right. Oliver, Oliver Burke, something like that. 01:07:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. 01:07:34 [Speaker Changed] The, the line that I remember from that book was 4,000 weeks is about 80 years is human lifespan. Yeah. Human life is insultingly brief. Yes. And that phrase just stood out. 01:07:48 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And this idea that we are all, every day approaching our death is actually empowering. Yes. Instead of discouraging. If you know that you don’t have infant time, you make better decisions. Frankly, 01:08:02 [Speaker Changed] Scarcity is an important economic thesis. 01:08:05 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. But you cut out the stuff that’s not important and you focus on the things and the people and the experiences that are, and anyway, I love this book. 01:08:15 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, no, I totally agree. Final two questions. Yeah. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career of, normally I would say whatever the person’s specific specialty is, but you’ve done so much across consulting and strategy and buy side and sell side and hedge funds and portfolio management, and now chief investment strategy. Someone interested in just finance or wealth management. 01:08:44 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I would say the most important thing is to keep an open mind. One of the most frustrating things, you know, young graduates and even young graduates from business school or or other graduate programs, is that they have like a path in mind. You know, in three or five years I expect to be here in 10 years. And I say keep an open mind because there’s so much disruption and so much change across these industries. You can’t have a mapped out plan. Your goal is to be a sponge and to learn and learn and learn, and also to be patient. Honestly, Barry, I’d say this a lot because you know, you get some like really smart 23, 24, 20 8-year-old who you know, wants to find out what’s over the next hill. And I wanna remind them, you know, if the actuarial tables are even somewhat right, they have 70 more years of life ahead of them. I think that’s right. And they don’t need to rush. They can enjoy the moment of learning, enjoy the experience, and understanding that not just, they’ll have the opportunity to pivot. They’ll have the mandate to pivot. As you know, industries get disrupted and technology evolves. Huh. 01:09:43 [Speaker Changed] Fascinating. And our final question. Yeah. What is it that you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew 25, 30 years ago when you were first getting started? 01:09:54 [Speaker Changed] I thought there was a more systematic way to approach investing when I first started, you know, close to three decades ago. And now I understand that true investing is both art and science. Maybe that’s the reason why I think I’ll stay in this business for the rest of my life because I’m constantly intellectually challenged to not get frustrated if a model doesn’t work out. In fact, sometimes the process of going through creating a model or a piece of analysis or going down a rabbit hole in research that doesn’t yield anything this year may actually be really helpful for me in three years, or help to reframe my thought process. So understanding that it’s not perfect and that it’s art and science. 01:10:33 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. Thanks Kate for being so generous with your time.

US stock market steadied Tuesday as Trump's tariff deadline delay gave investors hope for new global trade deals. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures showed modest movement after Trump extended the July 9 tariff start date to August 1, offering trading partners more time to negotiate. Countries like South Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia now have breathing space to respond. While markets remain cautious, the delay sparked optimism that Trump’s firm-yet-flexible stance may open the door for diplomatic progress. Investors now await the Fed minutes and Delta’s earnings to see what’s next for the economy.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Tesla’s troubles go far beyond CEO Elon Musk’s recent dust-up with President Donald Trump, who accused the former “first buddy” of going “completely ‘off the rails’” in a social media slap fight over the weekend. But while the battles between Musk and Trump are getting all the attention, the outlook for Tesla’s revenue and bottom line have gotten notably worse. And the company could even be back to losing money, for reasons unrelated to Musk’s personal politics. Musk was Trump’s largest financial supporter during the 2024 campaign, and was a mainstay at Mar-a-Lago and the White House at the start of Trump’s second term, with his role in slashing the federal workforce at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But Musk has since announced he was starting a new political party due to his displeasure with the tax and spending bill signed by Trump on Friday — and the barbs on their respective websites have only increased since then. Shares of Tesla closed Monday down 6.8%, as investors were concerned about the implication of Musk’s latest political moves, despite his promises to re-focus on the company. It rebounded only 1.3% in Tuesday trading. “Very simply Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,” wrote Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who’s known for being optimistic about the company. Ives put out a follow-up note Tuesday saying that the Tesla board should set ground rules to limit Musk’s political activities because the company is at a “tipping point” for its future. “Tesla is heading into one of the most important stages of its growth cycle with the autonomous and robotics future now on the doorstep and cannot have Musk spending more and more time creating a political party which will require countless time, energy, and political capital,” he wrote. Still, Ives maintained his buy recommendation and $500 price target for the stock in his note. But analysts at William Blair cut their recommendation on the stock to “market perform” or neutral, and also cut their earnings forecast for the company. Because even without the political stink, the Tesla’s financial outlook is suddenly looking notably worse. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. But when Ives posted his belief that the Tesla board should tie Musk’s future pay package to the amount of time he spends at Tesla and have oversight of his political “endeavors,” Musk responded with his own post on X, saying “Shut up, Dan.” Blair’s note pointed out that Trump’s bill not only removed the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle (EV) buyers, but also eliminated the financial penalties for automakers that fail to meet federal emissions targets. Emissions fines have historically forced automakers who still build primarily gasoline powered cars and trucks to buy “regulatory credits” from EV companies. Removing those fines eliminates “market demand for Tesla’s credits,” said the note from William Blair analysts Jed Dorsheimer and Mark Shooter. The sale of those federal and state credits added $10.6 billion to Tesla’s bottom line since 2019 and often enabled the company to post a profit. Without the revenue from those regulatory credits, the company would not have reported a positive annual net income until 2021, and it would have been back in the red again in the first quarter of this year, when its net income plunged 71% compared to a year earlier on sharply lower sales around the globe. Musk has largely downplayed all the recent bad news, saying the company’s future rests on robots, artificial intelligence and self-driving taxis. But the company’s taxi service is very limited to date, launching only in Austin, Texas, for a select group of customers – mostly Tesla fans – and with a Tesla employee riding in the front passenger seat to monitor the car’s performance. That puts Tesla behind the robotaxi service already offered in Austin and three other cities – San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix – by Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet. And Tesla’s rollout has had its shares of problems, including a video showing a robotaxi traveling on the wrong side of the road for about half of a block and another video of a robotaxi slowly turning its front wheels into a parked car. While Musk has promised his robotaxi service will be expanding soon across many other cities, he has not given any further details. He also hasn’t said when the Austin service will be expanded to the general public, nor when the company’s human monitors sitting in the front passenger seat will no longer be needed. Meanwhile, Waymo has definitive plans to expand its service to Miami and Washington, DC, next year in partnership with Uber. “We expect that investors are growing tired of the distraction at a point when the business needs Musk’s attention the most and only see downside from his dip back into politics,” said the William Blair note. “We would prefer this effort to be channeled towards the robotaxi rollout at this critical juncture.” Then there’s the problem of Tesla’s sales. Or rather, the lack thereof. Global sales were down a record 13% in each of the first two quarters of this year, compared to a year earlier, even though demand for EVs overall continues to climb, a further sign of Tesla’s declining market share. Part of the lost EV market share is due to increased competition, both from Western automakers rolling out their own EV offerings, and Chinese automakers that have made a massive push into the market. Chinese automaker BYD is poised to surpass Tesla in global annual EV sales this year for the first time, even though Tesla is a still a major player in China, and BYDs are not sold in the US. Demand is likely to weaken further come October 1, when the $7,500 tax credit for electric car buyers expires. When a previous version of the tax credit was phased out for Teslas in 2019, the company had to cut the price of the car by about half the value of the lost credit. Tuesday Tesla posted on X that “If there ever was a time to yolo your car purchase, it’s now,” referencing the upcoming tax credit expiration and using the acronym for “you only live once.” But Tesla has also faced missteps of Musk’s own doing. There has been backlash against Musk’s political activity, which has had a significant impact on Tesla sales. That is likely to continue even as he moves to distance himself from Trump. In the early months of this year, hundreds of protests were held outside Tesla showrooms in the United States, Canada and Europe. Worries about self-inflicted brand damage started the company’s shares on their downward slide. It prompted Trump, who was still Musk’s ally at the time, to announce he was buying a Tesla for himself. In March, the president hosted an event at the White House urging others to buy the company’s cars. At one point, Musk and Tesla investors might have hoped that in a closely divided country, the lost sales to Trump critics might be at least partly made up for by sales to Trump fans. But Musk seems to now face the possibility of backlash from both sides of the political spectrum. “He’s been able to alienate everyone, which many thought was impossible, but he’s actually been able to do it,” Ives told CNN Monday. “And the problem is, this soap opera just keeps going on.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Feedback Loops, Not Dashboards, Drive Real CX Insights

Time Published: 2025-07-08T11:23:32Z

CMSWire's Marketing & Customer Experience Leadership channel is the go-to hub for actionable research, editorial and opinion for CMOs, aspiring CMOs and today's customer experience innovators. Our dedicated editorial and research teams focus on bringing you the data and information you need to navigate today's complex customer, organizational and technical landscapes. We've got you covered. Metrics miss why. Behavioral data tracks what happened, but it rarely explains why customers act or leave. Feedback loops fill in those gaps. Ask, act, announce. Closing the loop requires three steps. Ask customers, act on input, and announce what changed. Most firms stop after the first step. Feedback builds trust. People don’t resist sharing opinions. They resist being ignored. Timely follow-up turns feedback into trust and stronger retention. Companies track click-through rates, build dashboards of behavioral data and run attribution models. Yet, many skip the simplest step of asking customers what they think. This habit reflects the deeper problem of metric fixation. Leaders chase numbers that are easy to collect, but those figures rarely explain why people buy, stay or leave. Studies show response rates for large federal surveys have fallen from 70% to under 40%, and executives point to “survey fatigue” as proof that asking questions no longer works. That excuse hides the real issue. People are not tired of sharing opinions; they are tired of feeling ignored. When feedback disappears into a black hole, trust erodes. When companies listen and act, participation rebounds. In other words, the flaw is not in asking but in how businesses treat the answers. This breakdown reveals the missing piece and shows how firms that close the feedback loop outperform those that only track clicks. We’ll cover shifting market trends, examine a real-world turnaround and end with a step-by-step plan you can use now. This will help you understand why moving from passive metrics to active conversation helps you measure what truly matters and build relationships that last. Companies that master feedback do not send longer surveys. They design shorter, smarter questions, time them to key moments and, most importantly, show customers how their comments drive change. The payoff is clear. It’s higher retention, stronger lifetime value and a culture that values listening over guessing. Most organizations rely on indirect signals to gauge engagement. They watch open rates, dwell time, net promoter scores and conversion funnels. Then they infer satisfaction from the movement of those lines. This approach feels scientific, but it hides three big flaws. Understanding the trade-offs between behavioral data and direct feedback reveals why active loops drive deeper insight and action. Amperity's 2024 analysis of global consumer retail and hospitality brands found that companies misidentify 23% of their most valuable customers, the very individuals responsible for over half their revenue. They focus on surface-level optimizations like faster page load times or shorter forms, yet customer defection continues. That is because behavioral data only reveals what has already happened. Cart abandonment or subscription cancellation becomes visible only after the damage is done. Direct questions, on the other hand, uncover intent earlier, before disengagement turns into loss. TruRating, a customer feedback platform, specializes in capturing simple, targeted feedback at the point of payment by asking just one question during checkout. This minimalist approach has proven highly effective, and it delivers response rates of over 80% in-store and 50% online. The results speak for themselves. TruRating clients have reported revenue increases of up to 8% after implementing changes based on the insights gathered. With more than 500 million pieces of customer feedback as of 2023, TruRating demonstrates that single-question feedback systems are not only scalable but also capable of driving measurable business impact. Metric fixation offers speed and simplicity but sacrifices depth and accuracy. It is like steering a car by watching the speedometer while ignoring the road. To fix the problem, we need to add a missing ingredient that brings customer voice back into the equation. Closing the loop requires moving beyond simple surveys to act on customer insights and communicate outcomes. The missing ingredient is an active feedback loop with three steps. Those are ask, act and announce. Most companies handle the first step, ask, by using surveys or pop-up forms. Only a few move to the second step, act, where teams review feedback, identify root causes and fix problems. Even fewer complete the third step, announce, by telling customers what changed because of their input. Why does this loop matter? It turns data into dialogue. When customers see that their voice sparks action, they feel valued and stay engaged. Zendesk found that a follow up within 48 hours doubles future survey responses and cuts churn by 30%. Active loops close the “why” gap left by behavioral metrics. Imagine a streaming service noticing a spike in mid-season drop-off. Usage data flags the episode where viewers quit; feedback explains the exit: too many product placements broke immersion. Start with a single, context-specific question placed at a high-impact moment. Route responses to a cross-functional team that can act quickly on experience, messaging and policy. Next, send a concise thank you, share what you learned and outline the first change you will make. Six weeks later, update participants on progress. A common mistake is to release new features and celebrate them without listening to customer feedback. Maybe you should consider addressing the issues your customers are facing before releasing new features and benefits. I use one tool to build emails and one tool only, Stripo. It is the most flexible editor I have ever used. But what really sets it apart is how they handle feedback. When you request a new feature or report a bug, they respond, tell you when they will fix it and actually follow through. I have seen real changes happen based on my input. It does not make me feel special. It makes me feel heard, not to mention the fact it makes my life easier. Other companies tell me they will put my suggestion on their “product roadmap” that they “take very seriously.” Roadmap or no, it feels like I’m just being pushed aside. Technology streamlines every step. Modern voice of the customer platforms tag themes, flag urgent issues and trigger tickets. AI sentiment analysis highlights emotional drivers that correlate with churn. Tech also tracks how many suggestions led to real change, which reinforces accountability. Do not over-promise. Focus on a few high-impact fixes per cycle. Do not ask questions you will not address. Finally, do not collect feedback just to check a box. If customers take the time to respond, they should see something change as a result. Active feedback loops do more than patch problems; they create a culture of listening. A few market shifts make active feedback loops essential. Privacy rules reduce passive tracking. As cookies fade, direct questions respect consent. Meanwhile, the demand for personalization has been rising. According to Accenture, 91% of people say they are more likely to shop with brands that recognize them and offer helpful suggestions, and 83% are willing to share their data if it helps make that happen. Another big market shift is that AI requires qualitative fuel. Large language models mine comment text for insight unavailable in clicks alone. Finally, don’t forget that social media amplifies voices. Forty-eight percent of online consumers have left a negative review online. Private loops solve issues before they go public. Forward-looking brands already benefit. SMS surveys achieve up to 45% response rates for Shopify customer feedback collection, with a read rate of 98%. When Delta implemented new customer survey software from Medallia, the company saw response rates double compared to their existing questionnaires during the initial testing period. Failing to adapt means flying blind as privacy rules tighten and dashboards lose fidelity. Active loops keep you aligned with consent-based data and evolving customer demands. Related Article: The State of Consumer Data Privacy Legislation in 2025 Common objections include the belief that annual surveys are enough because issues evolve quickly, but week-to-week changes demand timely feedback. Some worry customers will not respond, yet short questions at the right moment and visible follow-up drive higher response rates. Others cite a lack of analysis resources, yet freemium AI tools can tag themes in minutes. Scale is no longer a barrier. Amazon processes approximately 10 million customer opinions monthly through seller feedback alone, which demonstrates how large-scale operations can still maintain responsive customer engagement. Across industries, companies that close the feedback loop achieve significant measurable improvements. Research shows an average six-point net promoter score increase when organizations actively respond to customer feedback. Companies that close the loop with customers reduce their churn by a minimum of 2.3% annually, while those that don't close the loop increase their churn by at least 2.1% every year. Also, when it comes to revenue impact, upselling strategies informed by customer feedback can lead to revenue increases of 10-30% on average. Businesses see up to a 20% increase in customer lifetime value when implementing effective feedback-driven upselling approaches. Firms that cite loop programs on earnings calls often enjoy higher valuations. In 2009, Domino's Pizza was facing a severe brand crisis. The company was plagued by widespread customer dissatisfaction, with complaints describing their pizza as having "sauce that tasted like ketchup" and "crust that tasted like cardboard." Customer feedback was overwhelmingly negative, with frequent complaints about taste and quality. The company ranked last in a 2009 consumer taste preference survey, tied with Chuck E. Cheese. Sales were stagnant, customer satisfaction was at an all-time low, and the brand had developed a reputation for subpar food quality. Social media complaints and negative word-of-mouth were actively driving customers away. The company's stock price had fallen to $6.87 by Dec. 31, 2009, and same-store sales declined for the first time in company history in 2008, continuing into 2009. Domino’s Pizza collected customer criticism across surveys, reviews, social media and employee input. They publicized harsh feedback verbatim in national commercials to demonstrate accountability. They then launched the “Pizza Turnaround” campaign with the CEO openly acknowledging past failures. Next, they reformulated core recipes, including new sauce, a new cheese blend and garlic-seasoned crust. They retrained staff through comprehensive training programs to improve quality and consistency, and they upgraded delivery systems and kitchen equipment to support operational improvements. Streamlining processes allowed them to address service issues and improve overall efficiency. Significantly, they created a transparent communication system outlining changes, timelines and quality goals, and they released behind-the-scenes footage documenting the recipe and quality transformation. Through their “Oh Yes We Did” campaign, they reinforced their turnaround and ongoing commitment. Stock price rose from $6.87 in 2009 to $426.77 by 2024, a 6,200%+ increase, and U.S. market share grew from 9% to 15%. Q1 2010 same-store sales jumped 14.3%, the highest in company history at that time, and full-year 2010 same-store sales grew 9.9%. In 2010, Domino’s achieved its first positive domestic store growth since 2007, and they rebranded from “last resort” to the world’s second-largest pizza chain. They shifted their identity to a technology-driven company, with digital roles comprising half of HQ staff, and they rebuilt customer loyalty and established a stronger foundation for sustainable growth. The Domino's case demonstrates that radical transparency, comprehensive operational changes and authentic customer engagement can drive remarkable business turnarounds even when starting from a severely damaged brand position. First, set a clear objective; choose one journey stage to improve. Next, map the moment; position the prompt seconds after that stage ends. Then craft a microsurvey using plain language, with one rating question and an optional comment. Fourth, choose a channel; match customer preference, whether that’s SMS, in-app, email or kiosk. Fifth, build a response team and give them the authority to act. Next, close the loop publicly; you can thank them 48 hours later and update customers once changes go live. Finally, measure and iterate. Track response, resolution time and business outcome. You can expand your strategy once targets are hit. Some optional enhancements to this roadmap include incentivizing first-time responses with points or donations, localizing questions to key languages and rotating open-text prompts each quarter. However, remember not to survey your customers about things you can’t deliver on. Start on freemium tools; upgrade to sentiment analysis and CRM integration as volume grows. Create a feedback council to standardize libraries and share wins. Momentum beats perfection. Within a year, you can evolve from reactive support to proactive experience design that only includes one question, one action and one announcement at a time. Customer insight is not a data problem. It’s a trust problem. Customers are not reluctant to share; they are reluctant to repeat themselves. They will offer feedback but only when it feels like a conversation. They want to know that their answers will lead to action. The data supports this. Short, well-timed questions earn strong response rates, and companies that close the loop turn those responses into higher retention, greater revenue and a more resilient customer base. This is what happens when organizations stop guessing and start asking. Direct feedback delivers results when it is treated as input for action, not just another metric to monitor. One honest answer from a customer at the right moment can reveal more than weeks of behavioral data. You do not need to build a complex feedback architecture to begin. Ask one meaningful question. Fix one visible issue. Communicate one tangible change. Then ask again. That is how trust is built and rebuilt. If your company cannot act on customer input today, it is not ready for customer retention strategies, personalization or AI automation. But if you can respond to one piece of feedback right now, you are further ahead than most. Listening is not a campaign; it is a commitment. Active feedback is the foundation of sustainable growth.

Title: WOLF Stock To $20?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The Wolfspeed, Inc. logo appears on a smartphone screen in this illustration photo in Reno, United ... More States, on January 3, 2025. (Photo Illustration by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) While Wolfspeed faces severe financial challenges, recent developments suggest a potential turnaround story that could deliver exceptional returns for risk-tolerant investors willing to bet on the company’s survival and recovery. The appointment of Gregor van Issum as CFO sparked immediate investor confidence, driving the stock price up 2x following the announcement. Van Issum brings substantial semiconductor industry experience from his previous roles at ams-OSRAM and NXP, two respected players in the sector. His track record suggests he understands the complexities of semiconductor operations and financial management. Now, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process has already delivered significant improvements to Wolfspeed’s financial structure. The company expects to eliminate nearly $4.6 billion in debt (70% reduction) and cut annual interest payments by 60%, dramatically improving its cost structure and cash flow dynamics. Wolfspeed operates in the silicon carbide semiconductor space, which offers superior energy efficiency compared to traditional silicon chips. This technology is increasingly critical for electric vehicle applications, positioning the company in a high-growth market segment. However, if you seek an upside with a smoother experience than a single stock, you might explore the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500, garnering >91% returns since its inception. Additionally, check out – MSFT Stock To $1,000? If Wolfspeed successfully navigates its financial restructuring and executes its turnaround plan, the upside potential is substantial: The Wolfspeed turnaround story represents a classic high-risk, high-reward investment scenario. While the potential upside is substantial if the company successfully executes its restructuring and capitalizes on the growing silicon carbide market, the probability of success remains uncertain given the company’s operational challenges and competitive pressures. Investors considering this opportunity should view it as a speculative position suitable only for those who can absorb complete loss while recognizing that successful turnarounds in distressed technology companies can generate exceptional returns for those willing to accept the substantial risks involved. Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

HuffPost may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Shopping Writer for HuffPost With tariffs still threatening to make products more expensive, 2025’s Prime Day deals couldn’t have come at a better time. It’s worth jumping on big sales when they appear so you aren’t stuck paying significantly higher prices on items like personal electronics, tools and foreign goods with the fluctuating economy. According to previous HuffPost coverage, price hikes can affect multiple categories, including tech, major kitchen appliances, Korean skin care and more. Products in all of these categories are on sale for Prime Day July 8 through 11, so we rounded up some of the best deals to help you save on these investments and prevent yourself from having to pay even higher prices for the items you want. Prices change quickly on Prime Day, so keep checking back to see the latest updates. Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. Duracell batteries probably need no introduction. Plenty of emergency tools are battery-operated in the event that you either lose power or are somewhere without electricity entirely, so having batteries on hand is always a smart idea. These ones are made to last 12 years in storage, so you can save them for way down the line and rest assured they'll still work. When a Coway air purifier is on sale, you want to act fast to grab one at a discounted price. This sleek purifier has a complex, three-stage filter that captures and reduces up to 99.97% of irritating particles ― including pollen, pollutants and other allergens ― along with odors and volatile organic compounds (like airborne gases from your gas stove). It’s designed to purify rooms of up to 867 square feet and has a timer feature you can set to run one, four or eight hours before it automatically shuts off. It comes in black and white and measures 16.8 inches by 18.3 inches by 9.7 inches. When it comes time to replace filters (the odor filter every six months and the HEPA once a year) the process couldn’t be any easier, and a complete replacement set is easily available to grab with your purchase. And when it comes to ratings, the Coway Mighty has earned an overall 4.6 stars from 27,000+ shoppers. With an IP67 waterproof rating and an up-to-5-hour battery life, this palm-sized Bluetooth speaker is a outdoor must-have – and at only $30 right now, it's a complete steal. Reviews on the sound quality are overwhelmingly positive, too. “After months of hemming and hawing about this purchase, I impulse-bought this speaker from my neighborhood electronics store and I do not regret it one bit,” wrote shopping managing editor Emily Ruane. “My kids love listening to music while we walk to school (or now, camp) and my husband or I will often play it directly on our phones, but the sound quality and logistics there are not ideal because the kids always want to hold the phone. Now, they love holding the speaker – and fighting over who gets to hold it, of course – and blasting Black Sabbath or the ‘Frozen’ soundtrack while we stroll along. I love that its waterproof, too – this means we will be able to listen to podcasts during bathtime, which is one of our favorite evening activities.” Come on now. At this point, you know all about Apple's AirTags. If you already use them, then you know that their ability to help you track and recover everything from your keys to your phone to your cat is pretty priceless. If you're new here, then here’s how they work: Each AirTag can ping its own location, so when you attach it to one of your belongings, you can track that item via Apple’s Find My app, which is available in the cloud and on Apple devices like iPhones, laptops and more. Through Find My, you can even tell your AirTag to play a sound so it’s easier to find. People love these things for a reason and they're always finding new ways to get the best out of them. They're 29% off list price for Prime Day week but we don't know how many days they'll be discounted, so grab 'em while they're hot! Promising review: "Excellent for tracking luggage when you travel multiple days. My new use is when waiting at airport for luggage, you can get a sense when they will arrive on carrier or if you ship luggage to next hotel, you know they have arrived before your arrival." — Leonard Tsai The Laniege lip sleeping mask earned its rightful place in the cult beauty hall of fame long ago, but since then, the brand has birthed a new viral contender in the form of a squeezable and juicy balm that's formulated for swiping on the lips any time of day. Available in several flavors, this nourishing and shine-inducing formula is enriched with shea and seed butters for lips that are softer, more hydrated and youthful. If you still want the original lip mask that started it all, it's also on sale for Prime Day for 30% off. If you’re looking for a survival tool for home power outages, remote and outdoor living or maybe even your RV, then the gas-free Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 is one reliable powerhouse. This portable generator has also become a HuffPost reader favorite and it’s so powerful that one reviewer says it was able to run a full-size fridge and a few fans overnight. This backup generator has one 1000W AC outlet for powering home appliances and other devices, and it can fully charge up for use in 5.5 hours when plugged into an electrical outlet. It also includes a solar panel. It’s ideal for camping trips plus unexpected power outages related to the heat, storms or other extreme weather circumstances. The generator has two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, one DC car port, and three pure sine wave AC ports, along with LED lights. This HuffPost-reader favorite device is useful for keeping devices juiced on the go, so if you always have a low phone battery, this should help out. While most power banks are bulky and inconvenient to carry, this versatile keychain portable charger by Rorry is slim, small and easy to tote. The charger clips right onto a carabiner, bag, backpack or belt loop for easy access, and right now it’s on sale for 20% off. Nab it in your favorite color! Apple products, especially AirPods, have been known to sell out on Prime Days past, so get them while you can. These popular AirPods are equipped with Apple's H2 chip, which aids in more intelligent and dynamic noise cancellation that's two times stronger than the previous iteration. The immersive audio senses your head movements to provide rich surround sound, and you can enjoy up to 30 hours of total listening time with the charging case. Dr. Jart's Cicapair color correcting treatment has long been touted as a temporary cure-all for skin that's red and irritated, without needing a stitch of foundation or concealer. The secret is this green-to-beige cream pays homage to a traditional Korean beauty ingredient called centella asiatica, or tiger grass. It is an ultra-soothing and reparative grass that can help to rapidly neutralize redness, making it a great product for people that have rosacea, keratosis pilaris and acne-prone skin. Plus, it also has SPF 30, which is great for daily use and adds another level of protection. It's very rarely on sale, in fact, the last time the price was this low was last year's Prime Day! HuffPost readers love a high-quality skin care product that can replace pricey facial treatments, like this K-beauty serum that one beauty TikToker calls “filler in a bottle.” Its prowess is attributed to an ingredient called PDRN, which is widely used in injectables overseas. It has anti-inflammatory and tissue-repairing capabilities that can improve skin firmness and leave recipients with a telltale glow. It's usually extracted from salmon sperm cells, but Iope's serum has a completely vegan, plant-based formula that is as unique as it is effective. Additional ingredients like niacinamide, probiotics and caffeine round out this repairing formulation — all ingredients that are beloved by HuffPost editors and readers alike. It's such a great product that it was awarded a HuffPicks seal of approval. This 10-liter air fryer has 17 preset settings and three racks, with a maximum temperature of 400 degrees. You can bake, air fry, dehydrate or even used the included rotisserie spit to cook a rotisserie chicken. There's also a drip tray to catch messes on the bottom and make cleanup easier. You can clean the air in rooms up to 1,076 feet with this large room air purifier, which has dual air intakes to purify twice as fast (it only needs 60 minutes for a room that size). It operates nearly silent at just 24 dB, and you can choose between four fan speeds or just set it to automatic mode and let it choose for you based on the air quality. There's also a timer with three settings, so you can set it and forget it. The air purifier comes in black or white. Made by the K-beauty company Medicube, this collagen face mask is made to be worn over and can boost your skin's elasticity while you sleep. In addition to collagen, the mask contains skin-nourishing ingredients like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, glycerin and ceramide NP for hydration, skin barrier maintenance, addressing fine lines and other benefits. The mask dries down in 15 minutes and is designed to peel off easily in one piece for little mess. These sport earbuds are worn over the ear to keep from falling out, and are especially great for runners, campers or anyone who might fear losing an earbud while they're moving around. Available in six fun colors, the earbuds come in a charging case that has a dual LED display so you can always know the battery level. The earbuds boast up to eight hours of listening time on a single charge and a Bluetooth range of 33 feet. More advanced than your average speaker, this amplifier can upgrade your home entertainment system with 60 watts per channel by connecting to your TV, record player and other speakers. The amp is compatible with Alexa and Google Home, and you can stream Spotify, Amazon Music and more directly from it. You can use the WiiM app to adjust the volume and other settings from anywhere. Having an extra screen can help you see everything at once when you're working on a computer or smaller device. This Arzopa monitor has a 1080P, 15.6-inch display that can connect to your other devices with a USB-C cable. The monitor has a dual speaker system to deliver powerful audio, and can connect to a Mac, PC, Xbox, Switch, iPhone and more. Great for a small space like an apartment, dorm or even RV, this portable dishwasher can go right on the countertop and can hold up to two full place settings, or 30+ items. It only consumes 6 liters of water per cycle using the built-in tank, and has five washing programs in addition to an auto-open function and a UV sterilization function. You can even use this to wash fruit. You might be familiar with Cosrx's snail mucin essence, which we've covered here at HuffPost many times. But the essence isn't the only snail mucin product out there — Cosrx also makes this snail mucin moisturizer, which we found to be at a steeper discount. The cream has 92% snail mucin for moisturizing and exfoliating, along with hyaluronic acid. The cream is lightweight and can address redness, dryness and even acne scars. Get two gadgets in one with this dual air purifier and fan from Dyson. The fan circulates air and keeps you cool while the purifier works to trap pollutants in the HEPA filter. You can use Dyson's app to track changes in air quality and pre-set the machine for intervals between 30 minutes and 8 hours. The fan also features a night mode that operates more quietly so it won't disturb your sleep. The Google Nest Thermostat allows you to track your energy consumption, offers recommendations for when it's best to use in-house heating or cooling systems, as well as offers complete control of a home's temperature even when users aren't at home. The thermostat is designed to work without a C wire in most homes and doesn't require professional help to install nor the need for any other Google smart home devices. A lesser known — but perhaps just as good as — alternative to the uber-expensive Dyson Airwrap is the Shark FlexStyle multi-styler, a tool that utilizes the same reverse directional airflow technology and functionality as the famed predecessor, but with some added ergonomic differences. The FlexStyle features a swivel function, which changes the 90-degree positioning of the arm into more of a traditional-shaped hair dryer to help make it less cumbersome for all-over styling and easier for creating multi-directional curls. This tool comes with up to five attachments to meet your styling needs whether you're creating bouncy curls, salon-style blowouts or smoothing frizz. Promising review: "I have been using this beautiful instrument for the past few months and I have to say it is definitely a major time saver in the morning.It’s pretty easy to find your groove with the tool after the first few uses. I will say the handle is long with the curling attachment so I just adjust my grip towards the center of the handle and it actually feels way more balanced. Definitely a tool I enjoy to use for my hair and would recommend!" — Ben This well-known stick vacuum from Dyson makes vacuuming easier than ever thanks to its lightweight body and extra-portable cordless design, with two powerful cleaning modes so you can tailor its suction to the job at hand while enjoying up to 40 minutes of cord-free runtime. Those with pets (or long hair) will also appreciate how effectively this thing traps fur and hair without getting strands tangled in its brush. Plus, it's designed to capture an impressive 99.99% of dust and other allergens in its filter for a cleaner home and cleaner air. Bose infused its signature high-fidelity sound and powerful noise-canceling technology into these over-the-ear wireless headphones that offer 20 hours of listening per charge. Enjoy 11 levels of active noise canceling and a microphone system that allows you to take calls and be heard, even in noisy environments. K-beauty brand Anua makes this pore control cleansing oil with heartleaf, a Southeast Asian plant that has anti-inflammatory properties. You can use it to remove makeup or SPF, or as part of a double-cleansing routine to prevent your pores from clogging. According to the brand, you may begin to see a decrease in your skin's production of sebum (the oily substance your skin produces that can clog and cause breakouts) in as little as four weeks. Instantly get coffee shop-quality espresso in the comfort of your home with this wildly popular full-service espresso machine. Lattes, Americanos, cappuccinos and espresso shots are pulled to precision alongside a built-in conical burr grinder that grinds beans on demand and a frother wand for making perfectly delicious steamed milk.It’s the stuff coffee dreams are made of. HuffPost Shopping managing editor Emily Ruane raves about this Breville machine. “I did as much research as I could and this model seemed to be a popular and well-reviewed option,” she said. “The Breville was pricy, but it gets used at least twice a day. I wake up every morning looking forward to a perfect latte and I truly feel so fortunate to be able to enjoy this convenience at home.” Anker's Soundcore Bluetooth speaker is an outdoor-ready and super portable device that delivers crystal-clear sound with enhanced bass and zero distortion thanks to an advanced digital signal processor. This 12W speaker is also completely waterproof so you can enjoy up to 24 hours of listening time per charge no matter where you are. It's possible you've seen some version of these overnight hydrogel masks on TikTok that start off opaque and become transparent as all of the infused goodness absorbs into skin, leaving behind a complexion that's plump, hydrated and glass-like. These Biodance masks contain a collagen-peptide that's of a low molecular weight to penetrate deeper into the skin. It also has brightening niacinamide, moisture-trapping hyaluronic acid and galactomyces to improve skin tone and texture. These high-quality headphones are currently retailing for just $35. Enjoy up to 32 hours of battery life and if you ever forget to charge them, you can speed-charge for two hours of listening time in just 10 minutes. Make calls on the go with a “VoiceAware” program that lets you limit how much of your own voice you hear as you talk. These earbuds are water and dust-resistant, perfect for taking on the trail, mowing the lawn or using while working out or working at your desk. When it comes to quickly brewed single-serve coffee, no one does it like Keurig, and their K-Elite model has quickly become a fan-favorite. Choose between multiple brew types and strengths, including an iced coffee setting. Given what we know about Bose and the brand's reputation for unbeatable sound, the deal on this TV soundbar is worth a mention. Connectible with Bluetooth or an HDMI cable, the speaker offers a wide natural sound and spatial audio for an immersive listening experience. Stop misplacing your keys by attaching them to a Bluetooth tracker. Tile by Life360 Mate uses an app to help you locate whatever item you attach it to. The tracker can also be triggered as an SOS alert in case of emergencies. The Instant Pot Pro manages to do the work of 10 cooking appliances all in this 6-quart-capacity multi-cooker, already outfitted with five customizable settings so you can make your own recipes at the touch of a button. Home cooks can do everything from sauté to steam to sous vide and even make yogurt. The SoundLink Flex by Bose claims to offer the clearest possible sound by using a special positioning technology that allows the water-resistant speaker to sense what position it's in for optimal clarity. Its state-of-the-art design features deep, clear, and immersive audio and up to 12 hours of listening per charge.

Title: Will food delivery robots be a success in the U.S.?
URL: https://www.denverpost.com/2025/07/07/will-food-delivery-robots-be-a-success-in-the-u-s/
Time Published: 2025-07-07T22:20:29Z
Full Content:
Food delivery robots carrying everything from pizza to hamburgers are trying their luck on city streets and college campuses. It’s not clear if it is the future or a hilarious misstep. Visitors to Hollywood have probably seen them around, where they have been in operation since 2020, but there’s now an effort to spread usage to college towns. The Wall Street Journal wrote about how the robots are getting flipped over, stuck in snow piles and some students have been found to sit on them, or trip over them, when drinking. Companies like Coco Robotics, which makes food robots, noted they are a huge hit on social media, and kids find them cute. Tokyo also has seen a growth in food robots but, in general, has residents who are more respectful of the robots and it seems to be going a little better than U.S. college campuses. Question: Will food delivery robots be a success in the U.S.? Caroline Freund, UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy YES: If you build them, they will deliver. When Uber launched the first U.S. ride-hailing app in 2009, people asked who would get in the personal car of a stranger? Uber’s market cap is now nearly $200 billion. Americans love food delivery. Where labor is scarce, streets are easy to navigate, and people are hungry, robots will thrive. College campuses are great places to innovate, expand and refine service. Kelly Cunningham, San Diego Institute for Economic Research YES: Deliveries by robots certainly have potential to work well, particularly in congested urban areas having access provided by ADA compliant streets and buildings as well as ability to enter elevators. They clearly need some form of security as they inevitably will be misused, perhaps like Tesla cars having cameras to record vandalizing and to prevent misappropriating of their operations. Flying drones may avoid some problems navigating terrestrial obstacles and potentially be less intrusive and faster. Alan Gin, University of San Diego YES: There are some current problems, but the technology will undoubtedly get better in the future. Some Americans like the convenience of having their food delivered, and the food robots can do it at a lower cost than delivery services. Yes, college students may drink too much and try to abuse the robots, but that is likely to decrease as the novelty of the robots wears off and they become a more accepted part of life. David Ely, San Diego State University YES: College campuses, resorts and dense urban areas would seem to provide a suitable environment in which food delivery robots can be successful. There are many prospective customers in these markets who will appreciate the convenience and novelty of this innovation. Delivery via robot can be less expensive than alternatives that require a human. Experience will soon allow businesses to determine the distances, sidewalk conditions, regulatory constraints and weather conditions where robots can be successful. Ray Major, economist YES: But not in their current form, the current tech needs more time to mature. Think of this as a V1.0 of a generic personalized delivery service. As with many V1.0s, the concept is ahead of its time, and its implementation needs to be refined. Inventions like Apple’s Newton laid the foundation for iPhones. Segways failed, but in another form became e-bikes and set the stage for micro-mobility. Give it a few years and it might compete with Amazon. James Hamilton, UC San Diego YES: At least in some settings. In controlled environments like college campuses, hospitals and large corporate complexes delivery robots are already proving to be successful. The extent to which they can succeed in tougher urban environments is another question. They pose a new potential sidewalk hazard for the elderly and those of us with disabilities. And it’s yet another step leading people to greater social isolation with less interaction with real humans. Norm Miller, University of San Diego YES: Eventually these will be perfected and become part of normal operations, just as self-driving cars are inevitable. I’ve seen them used in Asian restaurants. I once had tenants that stole every campus machine not bolted down, and if these guys are not in jail, then the challenge for U.S. public delivery robots is that they are too easy to steal from, or abuse, and none, at present, have any defense mode like electric-shocks. Hmmm? Chris Van Gorder, Scripps Health YES: I don’t know if they will be successful in the general populations just like I’m not sure drones will be either, but in select communities like college campuses or major business campuses, they could be quite helpful and efficient. Scripps has been using food delivery robots or “TUGs” to deliver patient meals to different nursing units at Scripps La Jolla for years and it’s likely the use of these robots will be expanded in years to come. Phil Blair, Manpower YES: The U.S. will become early adopters of any technology that improves service and saves money. Jamie Moraga, Franklin Revere NO: Like the Bird and Lime e-scooters, these “cute” food delivery robots are likely to face significant challenges.

Additionally, they could pose liability issues and dangers to walkways and roadways, not to mention the threat of overregulation by local municipalities. The U.S. still has a way to go before food delivery robots can be successful. Gary London, London Moeder Advisors YES: I’ve seen them in Westwood (Los Angeles) and New York City. Early autos were probably targeted by horse and carriage people. Once the novelty wears off and delivery robots become ubiquitous, I’m sure they will just blend into the urban fabric. Change is hard, but the combination of densification in the cities, labor costs and technological advances makes them inevitable. We will eventually see a coupling of autonomous vehicles and robotics deliver to the suburbs, as well. Bob Rauch, R.A. Rauch & Associates YES: Food delivery robots are already gaining significant traction in the U.S., particularly in urban areas such as Los Angeles, San Jose and Dallas. Companies like Uber Eats and Serve Robotics have deployed over 2,000 delivery bots. Each of our hotels has a “service robot” for food, beverages and supplies, and customer satisfaction is high.

Food delivery robots carrying everything from pizza to hamburgers are trying their luck on city streets and college campuses. It’s not clear if it is the future or a hilarious misstep. Visitors to Hollywood have probably seen them around, where they have been in operation since 2020, but there’s now an effort to spread usage to college towns. The Wall Street Journal wrote about how the robots are getting flipped over, stuck in snow piles and some students have been found to sit on them, or trip over them, when drinking. Companies like Coco Robotics, which makes food robots, noted they are a huge hit on social media, and kids find them cute. Tokyo also has seen a growth in food robots but, in general, has residents who are more respectful of the robots and it seems to be going a little better than U.S. college campuses. Question: Will food delivery robots be a success in the U.S.? Caroline Freund, UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy YES: If you build them, they will deliver. When Uber launched the first U.S. ride-hailing app in 2009, people asked who would get in the personal car of a stranger? Uber’s market cap is now nearly $200 billion. Americans love food delivery. Where labor is scarce, streets are easy to navigate, and people are hungry, robots will thrive. College campuses are great places to innovate, expand and refine service. Kelly Cunningham, San Diego Institute for Economic Research YES: Deliveries by robots certainly have potential to work well, particularly in congested urban areas having access provided by ADA compliant streets and buildings as well as ability to enter elevators. They clearly need some form of security as they inevitably will be misused, perhaps like Tesla cars having cameras to record vandalizing and to prevent misappropriating of their operations. Flying drones may avoid some problems navigating terrestrial obstacles and potentially be less intrusive and faster. Alan Gin, University of San Diego YES: There are some current problems, but the technology will undoubtedly get better in the future. Some Americans like the convenience of having their food delivered, and the food robots can do it at a lower cost than delivery services. Yes, college students may drink too much and try to abuse the robots, but that is likely to decrease as the novelty of the robots wears off and they become a more accepted part of life. David Ely, San Diego State University YES: College campuses, resorts and dense urban areas would seem to provide a suitable environment in which food delivery robots can be successful. There are many prospective customers in these markets who will appreciate the convenience and novelty of this innovation. Delivery via robot can be less expensive than alternatives that require a human. Experience will soon allow businesses to determine the distances, sidewalk conditions, regulatory constraints and weather conditions where robots can be successful. Ray Major, economist YES: But not in their current form, the current tech needs more time to mature. Think of this as a V1.0 of a generic personalized delivery service. As with many V1.0s, the concept is ahead of its time, and its implementation needs to be refined. Inventions like Apple’s Newton laid the foundation for iPhones. Segways failed, but in another form became e-bikes and set the stage for micro-mobility. Give it a few years and it might compete with Amazon. James Hamilton, UC San Diego YES: At least in some settings. In controlled environments like college campuses, hospitals and large corporate complexes delivery robots are already proving to be successful. The extent to which they can succeed in tougher urban environments is another question. They pose a new potential sidewalk hazard for the elderly and those of us with disabilities. And it’s yet another step leading people to greater social isolation with less interaction with real humans. Norm Miller, University of San Diego YES: Eventually these will be perfected and become part of normal operations, just as self-driving cars are inevitable. I’ve seen them used in Asian restaurants. I once had tenants that stole every campus machine not bolted down, and if these guys are not in jail, then the challenge for U.S. public delivery robots is that they are too easy to steal from, or abuse, and none, at present, have any defense mode like electric-shocks.

Title: Chris Hedges: Profiting From Genocide

Time Published: 2025-07-07T20:00:00Z
Full Content:
Editor Activism Chris Hedges, ScheerPost War is a business. So is genocide. The latest report submitted by Francesca Albanese, Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, lists 48 corporations and institutions, including Palantir Technologies Inc., Lockheed Martin, Alphabet Inc., Amazon, International Business Machine Corporation (IBM), Caterpillar Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Massachusetts Institue of Technology (MIT), along with banks and financial firms such as Blackrock, insurers, real estate firms and charities, which in violation of international law are making billions from the occupation and the genocide of Palestinians. The report, which includes a database of over 1,000 corporate entities that collaborate with Israel, demands these firms and institutions sever ties with Israel or be held accountable for complicity in war crimes. It describes “Israel’s “forever-occuption” as “the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers and Big Tech – providing significant supply and demand, little oversight, and zero accountability – while investors and private and public institutions profit freely.” The post-Holocaust industrialists’ trials and the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission laid the legal framework for recognizing the criminal responsibility of institutions and businesses that participate in international crimes. This new report makes clear that decisions made by the International Court of Justice place an obligation on entities “to not engage and/or to withdraw totally and unconditionally from any associated dealings, and to ensure that any engagement with Palestinians enables their self-determination.” “The genocide in Gaza has not stopped because it’s lucrative, it’s profitable for far too many,” Albanese told me. “It’s a business. There are corporate entities, including from Palestine-friendly states, who have for decades made businesses and made profits out of the economy of the occupation. Israel has always exploited Palestinian land, resources and Palestinian life. The profits have continued and even increased as the economy of the occupation transformed into an economy of genocide.” In addition, she said, Palestinians have provided “boundless training fields to test the technologies, test weapons, to test surveillance techniques that now are being used against people everywhere from the Global South to the Global North.” You can see my interview with Albanese here. The report lambasts corporations for “providing Israel with the weapons and machinery required to destroy homes, schools, hospitals, places of leisure and worship, livelihoods and productive assets, such as olive groves and orchards.” The Palestinian territory, the report notes, is a “captive market” because of Israeli-imposed restrictions on trade and investment, tree planting, fishing and water for colonies. Corporations have profiteered from this “captive market” by “exploiting Palestinian labour and resources, degrading and diverting natural resources, building and powering colonies and selling and marketing derived goods and services in Israel, the occupied Palestinian territory and globally.” “Israel gains from this exploitation, while it costs the Palestinian economy at least 35 per cent of its GDP,” the report notes. Banks, asset management firms, pension funds and insurers have “channeled finance into the illegal occupation,” the report charges. In addition, “universities — centres of intellectual growth and power — have sustained the political ideology underpinning the colonization of Palestinian land, developed weaponry and overlooked or even endorsed systemic violence, while global research collaborations have obscured Palestinian erasure behind a veil of academic neutrality.” Surveillance and incarceration technologies have “evolved into tools for indiscriminate targeting of the Palestinian population,” the report notes. “Heavy machinery previously used for house demolitions, infrastructure destruction and resource seizure in the West Bank have been repurposed to obliterate the urban landscape of Gaza, preventing displaced populations from returning and reconstituting as a community.” The military assault on the Palestinians has also “provided testing grounds for cutting-edge military capabilities: air defense platforms, drones, targeting tools powered by artificial intelligence and even the F-35 programme led by the United States of America. These technologies are then marketed as ‘battle proven.’” Since 2020, Israel has been the eighth largest arms exporter in the world. Its two biggest weapons companies are Elbit Systems Ltd and the state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd (IAI). It has a series of international partnerships with foreign weapons firms, including “for the F-35 fighter jet, led by United States-based Lockheed Martin.” “Components and parts constructed globally contribute to the Israeli F-35 fleet, which Israel customizes and maintains in partnership with Lockheed Martin and domestic companies.” the report reads. Since October 2023, F-35s and F-16s jets have been “integral to equipping Israel with the unprecedented aerial power to drop an estimated 85,000 tons of bombs, much of it unguided, to kill and injure more than 179,411 Palestinians and obliterate Gaza.” “Drones, hexacopters and quadcopters have also been omnipresent killing machines in the skies of Gaza,” the report reads. “Drones largely developed and supplied by Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries have long flown alongside fighter jets, surveilling Palestinians and delivering target intelligence. In the past two decades, with support from these companies and collaborations with institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, drones used by Israel acquired automated weapons systems and the ability to fly in swarm formation.” Japan’s FANUC companies sell automation products and “provide robotic machinery for weapons production lines, including for IAI, Elbit Systems and Lockheed Martin.” “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller — Maersk A/S transport components, parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied military equipment post-October 2023.” There was a “65 per cent surge in Israeli military spending from 2023 to 2024 – amounting to $46.5 billion, one of the highest per capita worldwide.” This “generated a sharp surge in their annual profits,” while “Foreign arms companies, especially producers of munitions and ordnance, also profit.” At the same time, tech companies have profited from the genocide by “providing dual-use infrastructure to integrate mass data collection and surveillance, while profiting from the unique testing ground for military technology offered by the occupied Palestinian territory.” They enhance “carceral and surveillance services, from closed-circuit television (CCTV) networks, biometric surveillance, advanced tech checkpoint networks, ‘smart walls’ and drone surveillance, to cloud computing, artificial intelligence and data analytics supporting on-the-ground military personnel.” “Israeli tech firms often grow out of military infrastructure and strategy,” the report reads, “as the NSO Group, founded by ex-Unit 8200 members, did. Its Pegasus spyware, designed for covert smartphone surveillance, has been used against Palestinian activists and licensed globally to target leaders, journalists and human rights defenders. Exported under the Defense Export Control Law, NSO group surveillance technology enables ‘spyware diplomacy’ while reinforcing State impunity.” IBM, whose technology facilitated Nazi Germany’s generation and tabulation of punched cards for national census data, military logistics, ghetto statistics, train traffic management and concentration camp capacity, is once again a partner in this current genocide. It has operated in Israel since 1972. It provides training for Israeli military and intelligence agencies, especially Unit 8200, which is responsible for clandestine operations, the collection of signal intelligence and code decryption, along with counterintelligence, cyberwarfare, military intelligence and surveillance. “Since 2019, IBM Israel has operated and upgraded the central database of the Population and Immigration Authority, enabling collection, storage and governmental use of biometric data on Palestinians, and supporting the discriminatory permit regime of Israel,” the report notes. Microsoft, active in Israel since 1989, is “embedded in the prison service, police, universities and schools — including in colonies. Microsoft has been integrating its systems and civilian tech across the Israeli military since 2003, while acquiring Israeli cybersecurity and surveillance start-ups.” “As Israeli apartheid, military and population-control systems generate increasing volumes of data, its reliance on cloud storage and computing has grown,” the report reads. “In 2021, Israel awarded Alphabet Inc. (Google) and Amazon.com, Inc. a $1.2 billion contract (Project Nimbus) — largely funded through Ministry of Defense expenditure — to provide core tech infrastructure.” Microsoft, Alphabet Inc., and Amazon “grant Israel virtually government-wide access to their cloud and artificial intelligence technologies, enhancing data processing, decision-making and surveillance and analysis capacities.” The Israeli military, the report points out, “has developed artificial intelligence systems such as‘Lavender,’ ‘Gospel’ and ‘Where’s Daddy?’ to process data and generate lists of targets, reshaping modern warfare and illustrating the dual-use nature of artificial intelligence.” There are “reasonable grounds,” the report reads, to believe that Palantir Technology Inc., which has a long relationship with Israel, “has provided automatic predictive policing technology, core defence infrastructure for rapid and scaled-up construction and deployment of military software, and its Artificial Intelligence Platform, which allows real-time battlefield data integration for automated decision-making.” Palantir’s CEO in April 2025 responded to accusations that Palantir kills Palestinians in Gaza by saying, “mostly terrorists, that’s true.” “Civilian technologies have long served as dual-use tools of settler-colonial occupation,” the report reads. “Israeli military operations rely heavily on equipment from leading global manufacturers to ‘unground’ Palestinians from their land, demolishing homes, public buildings, farmland, roads and other vital infrastructure. Since October 2023, this machinery has been integral to damaging and destroying 70 per cent of structures and 81 per cent of cropland in Gaza.” Caterpillar Inc. has for decades provided the Israeli military with equipment used to demolish Palestinian homes, mosques, hospitals as well as “burying alive wounded Palestinians,” and killed activists, such as Rachel Corrie. “Israel has evolved Caterpillar’s D9 bulldozer into automated, remote-commanded core weaponry of the Israeli military, deployed in almost every military activity since 2000, clearing incursion lines, ‘neutralizing’ the territory and killing Palestinians,” the report reads. This year, Caterpillar “secured a further multi-millionaire dollar contract with Israel.” “The Korean HD Hyundai and its partially-owned subsidiary, Doosan, alongside the Swedish Volvo Group and other major heavy machinery manufacturers, have long been linked to destruction of Palestinian property, each supplying equipment through exclusively licensed Israeli dealers,” the report reads. “As corporate actors have contributed to the destruction of Palestinian life in the occupied Palestinian territory, they have also helped construction of what replaces it: building colonies and their infrastructure, extracting and trading materials, energy and agricultural products, and bringing visitors to colonies as if to a regular holiday destination.” “More than 371 colonies and illegal outposts have been built, powered and traded with by companies facilitating the replacement by Israel of the Indigenous population in the occupied Palestinian territory,” the report concludes. These building projects have used Caterpillar, HD Hyundai and Volvo excavators and heavy equipment. Hanson Israel, a subsidiary of the German Heidelberg Materials AG, “has contributed to the pillage of millions of tons of dolomite rock from the Nahal Raba quarry on land seized from Palestinian villages in the West Bank.” The quarried dolomite is used to construct Jewish colonies in the West Bank. Foreign firms have also “contributed to developing roads and public transport infrastructure critical to establishing and expanding the colonies, and connecting them to Israel while excluding and segregating Palestinians.” Global real estate companies sell properties in colonial settlements to Israeli and international buyers. These real estate firms include Keller Williams Realty LLC, which has “had branches based in the colonies” through its Israeli franchisee KW Israel. Last year through another franchisee called Home in Israel, Keller Williams “ran a real estate roadshow in Canada and the United States, jointly sponsored with several companies developing and marketing thousands of apartments in colonies.” Rental platforms, including Booking.com and Airbnb, list properties and hotel rooms in illegal Jewish colonies in the West Bank. Chinese Bright Dairy & Food is a majority owner of Tnuva, Israel’s largest food conglomerate, which utilizes land seized from Palestinians in the West Bank. In the energy sector, “Chevron Corporation, in consortium with Israeli NewMedEnergy (a subsidiary of the OHCHR database-listed Delek Group), extracts natural gas from the Leviathan and Tamar fields; it paid the Government of Israel $453 million in royalties and taxes in 2023. Chevron’s consortium supplies more than 70 per cent of Israeli energy consumption. Chevron also profits from its part-ownership of the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline, which passes through Palestinian maritime territory, and from gas export sales to Egypt and Jordan.” BP and Chevron also serve as “the largest contributors to Israeli imports of crude oil, as major owners of the strategic Azeri Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and the Kazakh Caspian Pipeline Consortium, respectively, and of their associated oil fields. Each conglomerate effectively supplied 8 per cent of Israeli crude oil between October 2023 and July 2024, supplemented by crude oil shipments from Brazilian oil fields, in which Petrobras holds the largest stakes, and military jet fuel. Oil from these companies supplies two refineries in Israel.” “By supplying Israel with coal, gas, oil and fuel, companies are contributing to civilian infrastructures that Israel uses to entrench permanent annexation and now weaponizes in the destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza,” the report reads. “The same infrastructure that these companies supply resources into has serviced the Israeli military and its energy-intensive tech-driven obliteration of Gaza. ” International banks and financial firms have also sustained the genocide through the purchase of Israeli treasury bonds. “As the main source of finance for the Israeli State budget, treasury bonds have played a critical role in funding the ongoing assault on Gaza,” the report reads. “From 2022 to 2024, the Israeli military budget grew from 4.2 per cent to 8.3 per cent of GDP, driving the public budget into a 6.8 per cent deficit. Israel funded this ballooning budget by increasing its bond issuance, including $8 billion in March 2024 and $5 billion in February 2025, alongside issuances on its domestic new shekel market.” The report notes that some of the world’s largest banks, including BNP Paribas and Barclays, “stepped in to boost market confidence by underwriting these international and domestic treasury bonds, allowing Israel to contain the interest rate premium, despite a credit downgrade. Asset management firms — including Blackrock ($68 million), Vanguard ($546 million) and Allianz’s asset management subsidiary PIMCO ($960 million) — were among at least 400 investors from 36 countries who purchased them.” Faith-based charities have “also become key financial enablers of illegal projects, including in the occupied Palestinian territory, often receiving tax deductions abroad despite strict regulatory charitable frameworks,” the report reads. “The Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) and its over 20 affiliates fund settler expansion and military-linked projects,” the report reads. “Since October 2023, platforms such as Israel Gives have enabled tax-deductible crowdfunding in 32 countries for Israeli military units and settlers. The United States-based Christian Friends of Israeli Communities, Dutch Christians for Israel and global affiliates, sent over $12.25 million in 2023 to various projects that support colonies, including some that train extremist settlers.” The report criticizes universities that partner with Israeli universities and institutions. It notes that labs at MIT “conduct weapons and surveillance research funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense.” These projects include “drone swarm control — a distinct feature of the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 2023 — pursuit algorithms, and underwater surveillance.” You can see my interview with the MIT students who exposed the collaboration between the university Israeli military here. Genocide requires a vast network and billions of dollars to sustain it. Israel could not carry out its mass slaughter of the Palestinians without this ecosystem. These entities, which profit from industrial violence against the Palestinians and mass displacement, are as guilty of genocide as the Israeli militray units decimating the people in Gaza. They too are war criminals, They too must be held accountable. Activism Activism Activism Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blog Posts, SaaStr.Ai The SaaS sector experienced a dramatic bifurcation in the first half of 2025, with clear winners and losers emerging based on AI differentiation, security positioning, and vertical specialization. While the broader S&P 500 gained approximately 5-6% YTD, SaaS performance ranged from spectacular gains of nearly 80% to significant declines of -30% (or more). Market Drivers: The performance spread of over 95 percentage points between top performers (~80%) and worst performers (-43%) highlighted the market’s demand for innovation and differentiation in an increasingly competitive landscape. How AI Led Palantir From Slow Growth (13%) to Hypergrowth (49%!) The SaaS market in 1H’25 showed clear bifurcation between companies with compelling AI differentiation (70%+ gains) and traditional enterprise software (single-digit or negative returns). Security and data infrastructure companies emerged as the biggest winners, while general productivity and communication tools lagged significantly. Bottom Line: Success in 2025 required either mission-critical positioning (security, data), clear AI differentiation (Palantir), or deep vertical specialization (Veeva, Guidewire). Generic horizontal tools and traditional enterprise software struggled to gain investor confidence despite solid operational performance. Data sources: Live stock performance data verified through multiple financial platforms as of July 2025 While we’ve focused on the SaaS bifurcation between AI winners and traditional enterprise software strugglers, there’s an important counterpoint worth highlighting: Oracle Corporation (ORCL). The 47-year-old database giant delivered a stunning +41% YTD performance, reaching $234.22 and a market cap of $658 billion. Oracle proves that legacy doesn’t have to mean left behind. 🤖 AI Infrastructure Positioning: Rather than trying to become an AI company, Oracle positioned itself as the essential infrastructure backbone for AI workloads. Their database and cloud services became indispensable for companies building AI applications. ☁️ Cloud Migration Momentum: Oracle’s aggressive cloud transformation finally gained enterprise traction, with customers migrating mission-critical workloads that competitors couldn’t easily displace. 💾 Data as the Moat: While others chased AI features, Oracle doubled down on what it does best—managing enterprise data at scale. In an AI world, data infrastructure becomes more valuable, not less. 👑 Larry’s Long-Term Vision: CEO Larry Ellison’s early AI investments and partnerships (particularly around autonomous database technology) positioned Oracle perfectly for the AI infrastructure boom. Oracle’s success demonstrates that established technology companies can thrive in the AI era—but only with the right strategy. The key isn’t trying to out-innovate AI-native companies at their own game, but rather becoming indispensable infrastructure for the AI revolution. Success Formula for Legacy Players: While Salesforce struggled with AI monetization (-19% YTD) and ServiceNow remained flat (+1% YTD), Oracle showed that with the right positioning, even database dinosaurs can soar. Bottom Line: The AI divide isn’t just about new vs. old—it’s about strategic vs. reactive. Oracle chose strategic, and the market rewarded them handsomely.

While the broader S&P 500 gained approximately 5-6% YTD, SaaS performance ranged from spectacular gains of nearly 80% to significant declines of -30% (or more). Market Drivers: The performance spread of over 95 percentage points between top performers (~80%) and worst performers (-43%) highlighted the market’s demand for innovation and differentiation in an increasingly competitive landscape. How AI Led Palantir From Slow Growth (13%) to Hypergrowth (49%!) The SaaS market in 1H’25 showed clear bifurcation between companies with compelling AI differentiation (70%+ gains) and traditional enterprise software (single-digit or negative returns). Security and data infrastructure companies emerged as the biggest winners, while general productivity and communication tools lagged significantly. Bottom Line: Success in 2025 required either mission-critical positioning (security, data), clear AI differentiation (Palantir), or deep vertical specialization (Veeva, Guidewire). Generic horizontal tools and traditional enterprise software struggled to gain investor confidence despite solid operational performance. Data sources: Live stock performance data verified through multiple financial platforms as of July 2025 While we’ve focused on the SaaS bifurcation between AI winners and traditional enterprise software strugglers, there’s an important counterpoint worth highlighting: Oracle Corporation (ORCL). The 47-year-old database giant delivered a stunning +41% YTD performance, reaching $234.22 and a market cap of $658 billion. Oracle proves that legacy doesn’t have to mean left behind. 🤖 AI Infrastructure Positioning: Rather than trying to become an AI company, Oracle positioned itself as the essential infrastructure backbone for AI workloads. Their database and cloud services became indispensable for companies building AI applications. ☁️ Cloud Migration Momentum: Oracle’s aggressive cloud transformation finally gained enterprise traction, with customers migrating mission-critical workloads that competitors couldn’t easily displace. 💾 Data as the Moat: While others chased AI features, Oracle doubled down on what it does best—managing enterprise data at scale. In an AI world, data infrastructure becomes more valuable, not less. 👑 Larry’s Long-Term Vision: CEO Larry Ellison’s early AI investments and partnerships (particularly around autonomous database technology) positioned Oracle perfectly for the AI infrastructure boom. Oracle’s success demonstrates that established technology companies can thrive in the AI era—but only with the right strategy. The key isn’t trying to out-innovate AI-native companies at their own game, but rather becoming indispensable infrastructure for the AI revolution. Success Formula for Legacy Players: While Salesforce struggled with AI monetization (-19% YTD) and ServiceNow remained flat (+1% YTD), Oracle showed that with the right positioning, even database dinosaurs can soar. Bottom Line: The AI divide isn’t just about new vs. old—it’s about strategic vs. reactive. Oracle chose strategic, and the market rewarded them handsomely.

Title: Lara Croft is popping up everywhere except in a new Tomb Raider game

World of Tanks collaboration announced. Fans eager to hear more about the next Tomb Raider game are still being kept rather in the dark, with Lara Croft popping up in a number of other game collaborations instead of her own standalone adventure. Since Shadow of the Tomb Raider wrapped back in 2018, Lara has appeared in the likes of Netflix's animated series, as well as Brawlhalla, Call of Duty, Dead by Daylight, Magic the Gathering, Fall Guys, Pinball FX, and now even World of Tanks as a part of a themed Battle Pass chapter. She's again being voiced by Keeley Hawes here, in my opinion the best Lara. The new trailer for World of Tanks, which you can see below, does give Tomb Raider fans like myself another look at Lara's unified design. As a reminder, the Tomb Raider team has said it will be uniting the original Tomb Raider games with the recent 'Survivor' trilogy reboots - which began in 2013 - in its next mainline game. Lara's look in World of Tanks reflects this unification. Her style in the latest Tomb Raider collaboration takes most of its inspiration from the 'Classic Lara' look of old, with her tank top and braid taking pride of place, but she also has her jade necklace from the last three mainline games. As well as Lara, Jonah from the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy is featured, as is - somewhat to my surprise - Amanda Evert. Amanda first cropped up in Tomb Raider Legend as a former friend turned antagonist of Lara's. Her look in World of Tanks is perhaps most different from her original design, with the goth aesthetic toned down quite significantly. Personally, I have questions about why she is there at all, given her timeline is the Legend Timeline, which is the second game timeline in the Tomb Raider series. But this question aside, as a fan of Tomb Raider games rather than Tomb Raider collaborations, I really do wish we were being fed more than just Lara Croft in other franchises. I understand the need to keep the character relevant, but at this rate Lara is at risk of being featured more in games that aren't Tomb Raider than games that are. Truth be told, I am becoming increasingly frustrated by the comparative silence around the next mainline Tomb Raider game. In 2022, Amazon said it would provide its "full support" to Crystal Dynamics, as it works on "the biggest, most expansive" series entry to date. Then, in August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well". Since then, however, developer Crystal Dynamics has been subject to layoffs, and nothing more has been officially said of the next Tomb Raider entry for some time. Earlier this year, Embracer alluded to a AAA release on its docket, which the company previously expected to debut in FY 25/26 but will "likely need a few more quarters to polish". Therefore, this particular game will likely release the following fiscal year. While Embracer did not specify which game under its umbrella it was talking about, I suspect it was Tomb Raider. I really hope the Tomb Raider series can continue on successfully without the need to pimp Lara out to other franchises every couple of months. But right now, I am not too sure.

Title: Unleashing the Power of End-User Programmable AI

PDF As a demonstration of what can be accomplished with contemporary LLMs (large language models), this paper outlines the high-level design of an AI-first, program-synthesis framework built around a new programming language, Universalis, designed for knowledge workers to read, optimized for our neural computer (Automind; queue.acm.org) to execute, and ready to be analyzed and manipulated by an accompanying set of tools. We call the language Universalis in honor of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a 17th century German polymath who had an amazing vision long before our time. Leibniz's centuries-old program of a universal science (scientia universalis; wikipedia.org) for coordinating all human knowledge into a systematic whole comprises two parts: (1) a universal notation (characteristica universalis; oxfordreference.com) by use of which any item of information whatsoever can be recorded naturally and systematically, and (2) a means of manipulating the knowledge thus recorded in a computational fashion, to reveal its logical interrelations and consequences (calculus ratiocinator; wikipedia.org). Exactly what current day LLMs provide! This may sound a bit abstract and academic, but it is extremely concrete and practical. Here is an example of a question that can be asked in natural language (the what): Question Alice bought a kilo of apples for $[@B]. She sold them for $[@S]. How much percent %[@P] profit or loss did Alice make? This is the generated Universalis implementation (the how): Answer The apples cost $[@B], and the selling price was $[@S], so Alice made a profit of $[@D is (@S-@B)].The profit percentage is therefore [@P is (@D/@B)*100)]%. To actually run a Universalis program, users need to be able to enter initial values for variables and view the values of computed variables. Depending on the environment in which Universalis code runs, the user interface can vary. Assuming a spreadsheet-style "live programming" environment where you can toggle between showing formulas and showing values, setting @B=10 and @S=17, @P=70 and the code renders as follows: Question Alice bought a kilo of apples for $[10]. She sold them for $[17]. How much percent %[70] profit or loss did Alice make? Answer The apples cost $[10], and the selling price was $[17], so Alice made a profit of $[7 is (17-10)].The profit percentage is therefore [70 is (7/10)*100)]%. Unlike traditional programming languages, which prioritize syntax and structure optimized for writing by professional developers, Universalis is designed with the philosophy that code should be read by domain experts and written by machines. This design tradeoff means that Universalis scripts are structured in a way that closely resembles natural language, making them intuitive and accessible even to those without formal programming training. A simple language reduces the complexity that an AI model needs to handle, making it easier for the model to generate accurate and error-free code. This shift in focus from writing to reading represents a significant departure from conventional programming paradigms, paving the way for a more inclusive and user-friendly approach to harnessing the power of AI. Think of Universalis clauses as some kind of literate Excel spreadsheet formulas such as [@D is (@S-@B)] over named tables, or relations, enclosed in hedges surrounded by natural language explanation, where cells in the table correspond to variables such as @B, @S, and @D (figure 1). The main goal in designing Universalis was that any user who can write basic Excel formulas should be able to understand Universalis scripts. Technically, Universalis is based on Prolog, and code fragments inside [...] hedges are logic predicates. You can also optionally specify, or let Automind generate, pre-conditions that are checked before the code is run by Automind: and post-conditions that are checked after Automind has run the code: Based on these pre- and post-condition contracts, you can reason about whether your program does what you think it does and raise an error if a condition is violated. Note that pre- and post-conditions are also vanilla Universalis programs, thus limiting the concept count for the user. By embedding pre- and post-conditions directly into the language semantics, Universals provides a pragmatic and extensible method for implementing AI safety. This approach allows developers to monitor and enforce the logical correctness and ethical compliance of all Automind computations. The concept of pre- and post-conditions should be familiar to Excel users as they correspond directly to Excel's data-validation rules. For example, the pre-condition [@B>0] corresponds to the rule in figure 2. The rest of the program text of the pre-condition corresponds to the input message that explains to the user why the constraint is put in place (figure 3). When the user enters a value that violates the pre-condition, an error is raised (figure 4). In addition, post-conditions are data-validation rules that are checked when the value of a cell is recalculated and serve as a test to catch potential errors in the cell's formula (figure 5). In Excel, however, validation conditions are not automatically run after a cell's value is calculated, but validation can be enforced on recalculated cells using VBA to implement post-condition checks. To allow for more complex calculations, besides chaining or sequential composition, of clauses, Universalis also supports conditionals, implicit lifting over sequences, and query comprehensions. In problem-solving and decision-making processes, people need a way to handle different scenarios based on varying conditions or inputs. Conditionals make it possible to define specific actions or outcomes that depend on whether certain conditions are met. Traditional programming often makes conditionals complex and difficult to read for non-developers. By structuring conditionals as checklists and explaining each branch in natural language, Universalis ensures that the logic is clear and intuitive for the human reader, while the Universalis interpreter Automind can still recognize them as control-flow decision points as it executes the program. Question Erik has [@btc] BTC. If that is enough to buy [@msft] MSFT, he'll do it; otherwise, he'll keep the BTC. Help Erik decide, and compute how much BTC he has left as [@btc_left]. Answer First, we need to get today's date [TODAY(@today)]. Next, let's find the current price of MSFT stocks [STOCK("MSFT", @today, {..."close":@msft_price...})]. The total cost of [@msft] MSFT stocks is [@msft_total is @msft_price*@msft]. Then, let's find the current price of BTC [SEARCH("current price of BTC in USD", {..."price":@btc_price...})]. The total value of [@btc] BTC is [@btc_total is @btc_price*@btc]. Now, let's compare the two values: This example assumes that the condition [@btc_total >= @msft_total] is false, so that branch is not taken. With different initial values for @btc and @msft, however, the result of the test might be true, leading to the other branch being taken. In such cases, the Universalis user interface crosses out the other branch as unused, clearly indicating the chosen path, while still displaying all possible continuations. When solving tasks, you often want to apply an operation to a collection of values rather than a single value. This need arises frequently, and traditional programming languages address it with for- and while-loops, or higher-order functions such as map and forEach. These constructs can be an unnecessary distraction for users who lack a computer science background. In Universalis, this is handled by implicitly broadcasting operations on single elements to collections, similar to how NumPy or Pandas operate in Python or how dynamic array formulas and spilled array behavior in Excel allow for loopless programming. Consider a primitive [toPdf(@src: File, @dst: File)] that converts a single file to PDF, and another primitive [listFiles(@directory: Directory, @files: List<File>)] that lists all files in a given directory. Question Convert all files in [@dir] to pdf. Answer List all files in the [@src] directory [listFiles(@directory, @files)]. Then, convert each file in [@files] to pdf [toPdf(@files, @dst)]. Even though toPdf is defined to convert a single file to PDF, the Universalis implementation implicitly converts the call [toPdf(@files, @dst)] on a list of files to something equivalent to [map(toPDF, @files, @dst)]. This means the user does not need to worry about how to stretch an operation on single files to collections of files similar to the conventions used in Excel and Cω (researchgate.net), the precursor of LINQ (learn.microsoft.com). In Excel, dynamic array formulas allow users to perform operations across multiple cells without needing to write separate formulas for each cell as well. For example, to apply a unary operation, such as calculating the square of each number column A in a named table Data, you can simply enter the formula =Data[A]^2 in the first cell of column B. Excel will automatically spill the results into the appropriate range in column B, applying the formula to each element in column A. A common scenario is where users want to process data by counting, filtering, grouping, aggregating, etc. By focusing on a structured natural-language approach for comprehending queries, Universalis ensures that even those with minimal experience in programming can perform advanced data manipulations. Here is a very simple example that requires filtering and counting: Question How many [@customers] live in Palo Alto in [@total]? Answer Consider each customer [@c = { ..."city": @city, ...}] from [@customers]: The corresponding query in SQL would be SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE city = 'Palo Alto'. While the SQL version looks more concise, consider that both the SQL as well as the Universalis query are expressing how to solve the user's original question, and it is not what the users themselves write but what they should read. The Universalis query expresses the same solution in a way that is easier to understand for users who might be a little intimidated by SQL. If a model were asked to explain the SQL query, it would answer with something close to the Universalis formulation. Of course, if users ever wish to see the equivalent SQL for a Universalis query, they can ask Automind to provide it, allowing them to understand the underlying structure from another perspective. The next question generates a complex answer that involves grouping and aggregation: Question Given [@Players], I need to select the best team for the next World Cup soccer. Answer Consider each player [@P = {"position": @Position, "stats": @Stats, "games": @Games, "age": @Age}] from [@Players]. Group each player [@P] by their position [@Position]. This organizes players into groups based on their playing positions (e.g., Forward, Defender). For each group of players in the same position: Keep only groups where [@AverageStats > 100] and [@MinimumGames > 3]. This ensures that only groups with high overall performance and sufficient experience are considered. Writing this query in SQL is quite difficult since SQL does not support nested tables, but assuming you have a COLLECT aggregate, the equivalent SQL for this query would be something like: SELECT P.Position, AVG(P.Stats) AS averageStats, MIN(P.Games) AS minGames, COLLECT(P) AS players FROM Players P WHERE P.Age > 18 GROUP BY P.Position HAVING AVG(P.Stats) > 100 AND MIN(P.Games) > 3 To make this query work in SQL, you would have to collect the rows into a JSON list, but the syntax and details for this differ among the various SQL dialects. Despite the tenacity of SQL, its lack of compositionality makes it a suboptimal query language for average users. To implement, or approximate, this query in Excel requires pivot tables and the use of XLOOKUP and VLOOKUP functions. Users who can manage that themselves are so sophisticated that they do not need Automind and Universalis. The actual implementation of Universalis uses Kotlin DataFrames, and Automind translates the query into the following code: players.groupBy(Player::position).aggregate { it.mean(Player::stats) into AggregatedPlayerGroup::averageStats it.min(Player::games) into AggregatedPlayerGroup::minGames it into AggregatedPlayerGroup::players }.filter { it[AggregatedPlayerGroup::averageStats] > 100 && it[AggregatedPlayerGroup::minGames] > 3 } While this implementation does support nesting, it is even less accessible for the nondeveloper user than the corresponding SQL. A lot of people seem to be focused on guiding LLMs to generate correct JSON. The real issue is not generating JSON, however, but making sense of the messy and complex JSON data that tools often produce. Consider an example where a tool generates JSON data for a stock query like [STOCK("IBM", @json)]. The resulting JSON might look like this: {"data": [{"symbol":"IBM", "name":"International Business Machines Corp", "exchange":"NYSE", "mic_code":"XNYS", "currency":"USD", "datetime":"2024-04-19", "timestamp":1713533400, "open":"182.42999", "high":"182.80000", "low":"180.57001", "close":"181.58000", "volume":"3037600", "previous_close":"181.47000", "change":"0.11000", "percent_change":"0.06062", "average_volume":"0", "is_market_open":false, "fifty_two_week":{ "low":"180.17000", "high":"183.46001", "low_change":"1.41000", "high_change":"-1.88000", "low_change_percent":"0.78260", "high_change_percent":"-1.02475", "range":"180.169998 - 183.460007"} }], "status":"ok"} From this blob, a user might want to extract specific information such as "volume" and "closing" price. Writing code to parse and extract this information can be daunting, even for those with a strong programming background, let alone for end users. This is where Universalis excels with its pattern-matching capability. Users can simply specify the patterns they want to match within the JSON structure: { ... "volume": @V ... "closing": @P ... "currency": @X } This pattern matching creates the bindings @V=3037600, @P=181.58000, and @X="USD.". Pattern matching in Universalis streamlines the process of working with complex structured data, ensuring that even those with minimal programming experience can effectively interact with and use JSON data. A typical compiler stack is implemented by first lexing (tokenizing) and parsing the program text into an AST (abstract syntax tree), doing semantic analysis on the AST to check for type errors, undefined variables, etc. Next, the AST is lowered into an IR (intermediate representation) to prepare for code generation and optimization. Finally, the optimized IR is mapped to target (machine) code. In Lisp, the lexing and parsing steps are trivial since the concrete syntax is the same as the data structure that represents the AST. Language geeks like to say that Lisp is homoiconic. Similarly, Intentional Programming abstracts from concrete syntax by focusing on representing programs as ASTs based on the high-level intent of the developer. The same AST can then be rendered into different concrete syntaxes based on the context. Since Universalis programs are trying to capture the high-level intent of the user as well, Automind does not generate the concrete syntax seen in the examples so far but instead creates an abstract, intentional representation of the Universalis code: [{ "comment": "Let's first calculate the worth of the apples in dollars." }, { "expression": "@W is @A*@X" }, { "comment": "Next, we need to find the current price of gold (assumed to be in dollars per ounce)." }, { "expression": "WOLFRAM(\"gold price per ounce\", ...$@G/ounce...)" }, { "comment": "Convert the result to a number." }, { "expression": "TO_DOUBLE(@G, @GD)" }, { "comment": "Finally, convert the worth of apples from dollars to ounces of gold." }, { "expression": "@WorthInGold is @W/@GD" }, { "comment": "ounces of gold." }] This representation can be rendered in different concrete syntaxes depending on the domain in which Automind is deployed. Universalis enables users to instruct LLMs on performing various tasks through a natural and systematic approach. Complementing this, the neural computer, Automind, executes these programs using LLMs as its virtual machine. Universalis is designed to be as intuitive as possible, allowing users to write, understand, and interact with AI-generated code with ease. By incorporating pre- and post-conditions directly into language, Universal ensures logical correctness and ethical compliance, offering a robust method for AI safety. Moreover, as we have seen above, Universalis supports advanced features such as conditionals, bulk processing, and query comprehensions, further extending its capabilities while maintaining a natural language feel. This versatility ensures that Universalis can handle a wide range of computational tasks, from simple arithmetic and pattern matching to complex data processing and workflow execution.

Today, test-time compute scaling offers a new, exciting avenue to increase model performance beyond what can be achieved with training, and test-time compute techniques cover a fertile area for many more breakthroughs in AI. Innovations using ensemble methods, iterative refinement, repeated sampling, retrieval augmentation, chain-of-thought reasoning, search, and agentic ensembles are already yielding improvements in model quality performance and offer additional opportunities for future growth. Vijay Janapa Reddi - Generative AI at the Edge: Challenges and Opportunities Generative AI at the edge is the next phase in AI's deployment: from centralized supercomputers to ubiquitous assistants and creators operating alongside humans. The challenges are significant but so are the opportunities for personalization, privacy, and innovation. By tackling the technical hurdles and establishing new frameworks (conceptual and infrastructural), we can ensure this transition is successful and beneficial. Erik Meijer - From Function Frustrations to Framework Flexibility The principle of indirection can be applied to introduce a paradigm shift: replacing direct value manipulation with symbolic reasoning using named variables. This simple yet powerful trick directly resolves inconsistencies in tool usage and enables parameterization and abstraction of interactions. The transformation of function calls into reusable and interpretable frameworks elevates tool calling into a neuro-symbolic reasoning framework. This approach unlocks new possibilities for structured interaction and dynamic AI systems. Chip Huyen - How to Evaluate AI that's Smarter than Us Evaluating AI models that surpass human expertise in the task at hand presents unique challenges. These challenges only grow as AI becomes more intelligent. However, the three effective strategies presented in this article exist to address these hurdles.

Here is an example of a question that can be asked in natural language (the what): Question Alice bought a kilo of apples for $[@B]. She sold them for $[@S]. How much percent %[@P] profit or loss did Alice make? This is the generated Universalis implementation (the how): Answer The apples cost $[@B], and the selling price was $[@S], so Alice made a profit of $[@D is (@S-@B)].The profit percentage is therefore [@P is (@D/@B)*100)]%. To actually run a Universalis program, users need to be able to enter initial values for variables and view the values of computed variables. Depending on the environment in which Universalis code runs, the user interface can vary. Assuming a spreadsheet-style "live programming" environment where you can toggle between showing formulas and showing values, setting @B=10 and @S=17, @P=70 and the code renders as follows: Question Alice bought a kilo of apples for $[10]. She sold them for $[17]. How much percent %[70] profit or loss did Alice make? Answer The apples cost $[10], and the selling price was $[17], so Alice made a profit of $[7 is (17-10)].The profit percentage is therefore [70 is (7/10)*100)]%. Unlike traditional programming languages, which prioritize syntax and structure optimized for writing by professional developers, Universalis is designed with the philosophy that code should be read by domain experts and written by machines. This design tradeoff means that Universalis scripts are structured in a way that closely resembles natural language, making them intuitive and accessible even to those without formal programming training. A simple language reduces the complexity that an AI model needs to handle, making it easier for the model to generate accurate and error-free code. This shift in focus from writing to reading represents a significant departure from conventional programming paradigms, paving the way for a more inclusive and user-friendly approach to harnessing the power of AI. Think of Universalis clauses as some kind of literate Excel spreadsheet formulas such as [@D is (@S-@B)] over named tables, or relations, enclosed in hedges surrounded by natural language explanation, where cells in the table correspond to variables such as @B, @S, and @D (figure 1). The main goal in designing Universalis was that any user who can write basic Excel formulas should be able to understand Universalis scripts. Technically, Universalis is based on Prolog, and code fragments inside [...] hedges are logic predicates. You can also optionally specify, or let Automind generate, pre-conditions that are checked before the code is run by Automind: and post-conditions that are checked after Automind has run the code: Based on these pre- and post-condition contracts, you can reason about whether your program does what you think it does and raise an error if a condition is violated. Note that pre- and post-conditions are also vanilla Universalis programs, thus limiting the concept count for the user. By embedding pre- and post-conditions directly into the language semantics, Universals provides a pragmatic and extensible method for implementing AI safety. This approach allows developers to monitor and enforce the logical correctness and ethical compliance of all Automind computations. The concept of pre- and post-conditions should be familiar to Excel users as they correspond directly to Excel's data-validation rules. For example, the pre-condition [@B>0] corresponds to the rule in figure 2. The rest of the program text of the pre-condition corresponds to the input message that explains to the user why the constraint is put in place (figure 3). When the user enters a value that violates the pre-condition, an error is raised (figure 4). In addition, post-conditions are data-validation rules that are checked when the value of a cell is recalculated and serve as a test to catch potential errors in the cell's formula (figure 5). In Excel, however, validation conditions are not automatically run after a cell's value is calculated, but validation can be enforced on recalculated cells using VBA to implement post-condition checks. To allow for more complex calculations, besides chaining or sequential composition, of clauses, Universalis also supports conditionals, implicit lifting over sequences, and query comprehensions. In problem-solving and decision-making processes, people need a way to handle different scenarios based on varying conditions or inputs. Conditionals make it possible to define specific actions or outcomes that depend on whether certain conditions are met. Traditional programming often makes conditionals complex and difficult to read for non-developers. By structuring conditionals as checklists and explaining each branch in natural language, Universalis ensures that the logic is clear and intuitive for the human reader, while the Universalis interpreter Automind can still recognize them as control-flow decision points as it executes the program. Question Erik has [@btc] BTC. If that is enough to buy [@msft] MSFT, he'll do it; otherwise, he'll keep the BTC. Help Erik decide, and compute how much BTC he has left as [@btc_left]. Answer First, we need to get today's date [TODAY(@today)]. Next, let's find the current price of MSFT stocks [STOCK("MSFT", @today, {..."close":@msft_price...})]. The total cost of [@msft] MSFT stocks is [@msft_total is @msft_price*@msft]. Then, let's find the current price of BTC [SEARCH("current price of BTC in USD", {..."price":@btc_price...})]. The total value of [@btc] BTC is [@btc_total is @btc_price*@btc]. Now, let's compare the two values: This example assumes that the condition [@btc_total >= @msft_total] is false, so that branch is not taken. With different initial values for @btc and @msft, however, the result of the test might be true, leading to the other branch being taken. In such cases, the Universalis user interface crosses out the other branch as unused, clearly indicating the chosen path, while still displaying all possible continuations. When solving tasks, you often want to apply an operation to a collection of values rather than a single value. This need arises frequently, and traditional programming languages address it with for- and while-loops, or higher-order functions such as map and forEach. These constructs can be an unnecessary distraction for users who lack a computer science background. In Universalis, this is handled by implicitly broadcasting operations on single elements to collections, similar to how NumPy or Pandas operate in Python or how dynamic array formulas and spilled array behavior in Excel allow for loopless programming. Consider a primitive [toPdf(@src: File, @dst: File)] that converts a single file to PDF, and another primitive [listFiles(@directory: Directory, @files: List<File>)] that lists all files in a given directory. Question Convert all files in [@dir] to pdf. Answer List all files in the [@src] directory [listFiles(@directory, @files)]. Then, convert each file in [@files] to pdf [toPdf(@files, @dst)]. Even though toPdf is defined to convert a single file to PDF, the Universalis implementation implicitly converts the call [toPdf(@files, @dst)] on a list of files to something equivalent to [map(toPDF, @files, @dst)]. This means the user does not need to worry about how to stretch an operation on single files to collections of files similar to the conventions used in Excel and Cω (researchgate.net), the precursor of LINQ (learn.microsoft.com). In Excel, dynamic array formulas allow users to perform operations across multiple cells without needing to write separate formulas for each cell as well. For example, to apply a unary operation, such as calculating the square of each number column A in a named table Data, you can simply enter the formula =Data[A]^2 in the first cell of column B. Excel will automatically spill the results into the appropriate range in column B, applying the formula to each element in column A. A common scenario is where users want to process data by counting, filtering, grouping, aggregating, etc. By focusing on a structured natural-language approach for comprehending queries, Universalis ensures that even those with minimal experience in programming can perform advanced data manipulations. Here is a very simple example that requires filtering and counting: Question How many [@customers] live in Palo Alto in [@total]? Answer Consider each customer [@c = { ..."city": @city, ...}] from [@customers]: The corresponding query in SQL would be SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE city = 'Palo Alto'. While the SQL version looks more concise, consider that both the SQL as well as the Universalis query are expressing how to solve the user's original question, and it is not what the users themselves write but what they should read. The Universalis query expresses the same solution in a way that is easier to understand for users who might be a little intimidated by SQL. If a model were asked to explain the SQL query, it would answer with something close to the Universalis formulation. Of course, if users ever wish to see the equivalent SQL for a Universalis query, they can ask Automind to provide it, allowing them to understand the underlying structure from another perspective. The next question generates a complex answer that involves grouping and aggregation: Question Given [@Players], I need to select the best team for the next World Cup soccer. Answer Consider each player [@P = {"position": @Position, "stats": @Stats, "games": @Games, "age": @Age}] from [@Players]. Group each player [@P] by their position [@Position]. This organizes players into groups based on their playing positions (e.g., Forward, Defender). For each group of players in the same position: Keep only groups where [@AverageStats > 100] and [@MinimumGames > 3]. This ensures that only groups with high overall performance and sufficient experience are considered. Writing this query in SQL is quite difficult since SQL does not support nested tables, but assuming you have a COLLECT aggregate, the equivalent SQL for this query would be something like: SELECT P.Position, AVG(P.Stats) AS averageStats, MIN(P.Games) AS minGames, COLLECT(P) AS players FROM Players P WHERE P.Age > 18 GROUP BY P.Position HAVING AVG(P.Stats) > 100 AND MIN(P.Games) > 3 To make this query work in SQL, you would have to collect the rows into a JSON list, but the syntax and details for this differ among the various SQL dialects. Despite the tenacity of SQL, its lack of compositionality makes it a suboptimal query language for average users. To implement, or approximate, this query in Excel requires pivot tables and the use of XLOOKUP and VLOOKUP functions. Users who can manage that themselves are so sophisticated that they do not need Automind and Universalis. The actual implementation of Universalis uses Kotlin DataFrames, and Automind translates the query into the following code: players.groupBy(Player::position).aggregate { it.mean(Player::stats) into AggregatedPlayerGroup::averageStats it.min(Player::games) into AggregatedPlayerGroup::minGames it into AggregatedPlayerGroup::players }.filter { it[AggregatedPlayerGroup::averageStats] > 100 && it[AggregatedPlayerGroup::minGames] > 3 } While this implementation does support nesting, it is even less accessible for the nondeveloper user than the corresponding SQL. A lot of people seem to be focused on guiding LLMs to generate correct JSON. The real issue is not generating JSON, however, but making sense of the messy and complex JSON data that tools often produce. Consider an example where a tool generates JSON data for a stock query like [STOCK("IBM", @json)]. The resulting JSON might look like this: {"data": [{"symbol":"IBM", "name":"International Business Machines Corp", "exchange":"NYSE", "mic_code":"XNYS", "currency":"USD", "datetime":"2024-04-19", "timestamp":1713533400, "open":"182.42999", "high":"182.80000", "low":"180.57001", "close":"181.58000", "volume":"3037600", "previous_close":"181.47000", "change":"0.11000", "percent_change":"0.06062", "average_volume":"0", "is_market_open":false, "fifty_two_week":{ "low":"180.17000", "high":"183.46001", "low_change":"1.41000", "high_change":"-1.88000", "low_change_percent":"0.78260", "high_change_percent":"-1.02475", "range":"180.169998 - 183.460007"} }], "status":"ok"} From this blob, a user might want to extract specific information such as "volume" and "closing" price. Writing code to parse and extract this information can be daunting, even for those with a strong programming background, let alone for end users. This is where Universalis excels with its pattern-matching capability. Users can simply specify the patterns they want to match within the JSON structure: { ... "volume": @V ... "closing": @P ... "currency": @X } This pattern matching creates the bindings @V=3037600, @P=181.58000, and @X="USD.". Pattern matching in Universalis streamlines the process of working with complex structured data, ensuring that even those with minimal programming experience can effectively interact with and use JSON data. A typical compiler stack is implemented by first lexing (tokenizing) and parsing the program text into an AST (abstract syntax tree), doing semantic analysis on the AST to check for type errors, undefined variables, etc. Next, the AST is lowered into an IR (intermediate representation) to prepare for code generation and optimization. Finally, the optimized IR is mapped to target (machine) code. In Lisp, the lexing and parsing steps are trivial since the concrete syntax is the same as the data structure that represents the AST. Language geeks like to say that Lisp is homoiconic. Similarly, Intentional Programming abstracts from concrete syntax by focusing on representing programs as ASTs based on the high-level intent of the developer. The same AST can then be rendered into different concrete syntaxes based on the context. Since Universalis programs are trying to capture the high-level intent of the user as well, Automind does not generate the concrete syntax seen in the examples so far but instead creates an abstract, intentional representation of the Universalis code: [{ "comment": "Let's first calculate the worth of the apples in dollars." }, { "expression": "@W is @A*@X" }, { "comment": "Next, we need to find the current price of gold (assumed to be in dollars per ounce)." }, { "expression": "WOLFRAM(\"gold price per ounce\", ...$@G/ounce...)" }, { "comment": "Convert the result to a number." }, { "expression": "TO_DOUBLE(@G, @GD)" }, { "comment": "Finally, convert the worth of apples from dollars to ounces of gold." }, { "expression": "@WorthInGold is @W/@GD" }, { "comment": "ounces of gold." }] This representation can be rendered in different concrete syntaxes depending on the domain in which Automind is deployed. Universalis enables users to instruct LLMs on performing various tasks through a natural and systematic approach. Complementing this, the neural computer, Automind, executes these programs using LLMs as its virtual machine. Universalis is designed to be as intuitive as possible, allowing users to write, understand, and interact with AI-generated code with ease. By incorporating pre- and post-conditions directly into language, Universal ensures logical correctness and ethical compliance, offering a robust method for AI safety. Moreover, as we have seen above, Universalis supports advanced features such as conditionals, bulk processing, and query comprehensions, further extending its capabilities while maintaining a natural language feel. This versatility ensures that Universalis can handle a wide range of computational tasks, from simple arithmetic and pattern matching to complex data processing and workflow execution.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The OpenAI logo appears on a smartphone screen and the Microsoft logo on a laptop screen as the ... More background in Athens, Greece, on July 4, 2025. Microsoft cuts up to 9,000 more jobs as it invests in AI. (Photo by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Microsoft’s stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) has already achieved remarkable gains, increasing over 2x from $235 in early 2023 to about $500 now. What factors could drive the stock to double from its current value over the next few years? The answer is found in Azure and AI – the main growth engine for Microsoft. The company’s AI strategy is yielding tangible results, with notable uptake of its AI-driven features across its product offerings. This momentum, especially in its cloud computing sector, positions Microsoft for significant future expansion as businesses progressively adopt AI solutions in their operations. On another note, if you seek an upside with a smoother experience than a single stock, you might explore the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500, garnering >91% returns since its inception. Additionally, check out – SOUN Stock To $20? Microsoft is making a significant investment in its AI infrastructure, with capital expenditures expected to rise from approximately $44 billion in 2024 to over $80 billion in 2025. This considerable investment is largely driven by the growing demands of artificial intelligence. Azure is the primary beneficiary of this investment in AI infrastructure, experiencing over 30% growth that is anticipated to persist in the near future. However, Microsoft’s integration of AI extends well beyond Azure. Hundreds of thousands of customers are already utilizing Microsoft 365 Copilot to transform their daily workflows. This represents a major transition for Microsoft, shifting from the sale of traditional software licenses to providing AI-driven productivity improvements, which command premium pricing and encourage deeper customer dependence. For instance, more than 230,000 organizations—including 90% of the Fortune 500—have already embraced Copilot Studio to create AI agents, indicating Microsoft’s successful shift from pilot projects to widespread enterprise implementation. Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment serves as the company’s foremost revenue driver, producing roughly $105 billion in 2024 with impressive 20% growth. This segment is Microsoft’s fastest-growing and highest-margin area, benefiting from its unique status as both a cloud infrastructure provider and a leader in enterprise software. The incorporation of AI capabilities into Azure services further increases its value, while strong enterprise relationships ensure customer loyalty and opportunities for upselling. While Azure’s rapid growth garners significant attention, Microsoft’s Productivity and Business Processes segment provides an essential foundation. This segment, which includes Microsoft 365, generated $78 billion in 2024, delivering stable, recurring income. This dependable revenue source allows Microsoft to finance investments in high-growth fields such as AI and cloud services. The 82.5 million Office 365 subscriptions, an increase of 10% year-over-year, highlight the stickiness of this business. With total annual revenues exceeding $245 billion, this stable base enables Microsoft to aggressively invest in AI and cloud infrastructure while maintaining strong profitability across its varied business portfolio. For Microsoft’s stock to double, the company must maintain its impressive growth, predominantly driven by its strategic leadership in AI and cloud computing. This growth will likely be propelled by the increasing adoption of AI across its Azure platform and the robust monetization of its AI-driven software, especially Microsoft 365 Copilot. Examining the figures, we estimate Microsoft’s revenues will surpass $405 billion within the next four years, with adjusted earnings exceeding $20 per share. Currently trading around $500, MSFT stock is valued at about 14 times its trailing revenues. Although this is slightly higher than its four-year average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of over 12 times, the substantial growth in Azure and Copilot may justify a premium. If Azure sustains its remarkable 30%+ growth rate, the accelerated revenue could merit even higher valuation multiples. Additionally, AI services often yield higher margins than traditional cloud infrastructure. As AI becomes a more significant contributor to Microsoft’s revenue, operational leverage could lead to considerable profit growth. If Microsoft establishes a clear lead in enterprise AI, mirroring its historical dominance in productivity software, investors might attribute a lasting premium valuation to the stock. Even a minor increase in the P/S ratio to 18 times could push the stock beyond $1,000 within the next four years. The combination of growing revenues across all segments and improved profitability stemming from AI efficiencies could substantially enhance investor confidence in Microsoft. As the company showcases its ability to monetize significant AI investments while preserving market leadership, investors may begin to apply premium valuation multiples typically reserved for high-growth technology firms. This multiple expansion, coupled with fundamental business growth, provides a mathematical foundation for the stock to double. This outcome relies on both sustained revenue growth and a reevaluation of Microsoft’s long-term earnings potential within the AI economy. While Microsoft’s trajectory appears optimistic, a number of factors could impede the stock from doubling. The primary concern is the normalization of AI spending. Companies might become more cautious about initiating new Azure projects, implying that the current rate of AI investment may not be sustainable over the long term. Additionally, competition from Google, Amazon, and emerging competitors could also challenge Microsoft’s pricing power in the AI market and its ability to gain market share. High-interest rates could render growth stocks like Microsoft less attractive compared to fixed-income alternatives. In summary, investors considering a position in Microsoft should also account for these risks. Now, we implement a risk assessment framework while developing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, consisting of 30 stocks, has a record of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; experiencing less volatility, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. These five Berkshire Hathaway dividend stocks represent a compelling mix of reliable income ... More generators spanning multiple sectors and investment themes. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio has long been regarded as a treasure trove of high-quality, dividend-paying stocks. The Oracle of Omaha's investment philosophy centers on identifying companies with durable competitive advantages, strong management teams, and the ability to generate consistent cash flows over the long term. These characteristics naturally lend themselves to reliable dividend payments, making Berkshire's holdings an excellent starting point for income-focused investors. In this analysis, we'll examine five standout dividend stocks from Berkshire Hathaway's current portfolio that offer compelling income opportunities. Selection methodology focused on companies with sustainable dividend yields, strong financial fundamentals and proven track records of returning capital to shareholders. I evaluated each holding based on dividend sustainability, business quality and overall investment merit in order to identify the most attractive income-generating opportunities within Buffett's carefully curated portfolio. Chevron Corporation stands as one of the most reliable dividend payers in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, offering investors a compelling 4.78% dividend yield backed by one of the strongest balance sheets in the energy sector. As an integrated oil and gas company, Chevron operates across the entire energy value chain, from exploration and production to refining and marketing. This diversification provides multiple revenue streams and helps stabilize cash flows even during volatile commodity price cycles. The company's recent performance reflects the strength of its operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation strategy. Trading at around $143 per share as of June 30, 2025, Chevron has demonstrated remarkable resilience in navigating the complex energy landscape. The company's forward dividend of $6.84 per share represents a substantial commitment to returning capital to shareholders, supported by robust free cash flow generation from its high-quality asset base. Chevron's position as a top dividend pick stems from its conservative financial management and focus on maintaining dividend payments through various market cycles. The company has consistently prioritized shareholder returns while investing in lower-carbon energy solutions and maintaining operational efficiency. With its strong credit profile and diversified operations spanning multiple geographic regions, Chevron offers income investors both attractive current yield and the potential for dividend growth as energy markets evolve. Warren Buffett's significant investment in Chevron reflects his confidence in the company's long-term prospects and management team's ability to generate sustainable returns. The energy giant's commitment to maintaining its dividend even during challenging periods makes it an attractive option for investors seeking reliable income from the energy sector. Apple represents one of Berkshire Hathaway's most significant holdings and showcases how even technology companies can become reliable dividend payers when they achieve sufficient scale and maturity. While the company's 0.51% dividend yield may appear modest compared to traditional income stocks, Apple's dividend story is compelling when viewed through the lens of total shareholder returns and the company's massive capital return program. Trading at around $200 per share, Apple has a forward dividend of $1 per share, which may seem small in absolute terms. Still, it's backed by one of the strongest balance sheets in corporate America and unprecedented cash generation capabilities. Apple's services business, in particular, provides recurring revenue streams that support dividend sustainability. The company's dividend policy reflects a balanced approach to capital allocation, combining regular dividend payments with substantial share repurchase programs. This strategy has proven highly effective in returning capital to shareholders while maintaining the financial flexibility needed for continued innovation and strategic investments. Apple's dividend has grown consistently since its reinstatement in 2012, demonstrating management's commitment to rewarding long-term shareholders. What makes Apple particularly attractive as a dividend stock within Berkshire's portfolio is the company's ability to generate enormous free cash flows from its integrated hardware, software, and services ecosystem. The recurring nature of services revenue, combined with the loyalty of Apple's customer base, provides a stable foundation for future dividend growth. Warren Buffett's substantial investment in Apple reflects his recognition of the company's transformation from a pure technology play into a mature, cash-generating enterprise capable of supporting reliable dividend payments. The Coca-Cola Company represents the quintessential Berkshire Hathaway dividend stock, embodying Warren Buffett's investment philosophy of owning businesses with enduring competitive advantages and predictable cash flows. With a dividend yield of 2.88% and trading around $70 per share, Coca-Cola continues to demonstrate why it has been one of Buffett's longest-held and most successful investments, spanning over three decades in the Berkshire portfolio. As the world's largest beverage company, Coca-Cola operates one of the most recognizable and valuable brand portfolios in the consumer goods industry. The company's global reach extends to virtually every country, providing geographic diversification and multiple growth opportunities across developed and emerging markets. Coca-Cola's forward dividend of $2 per share represents a substantial commitment to shareholders, supported by the company's consistent cash flow generation and strong market positions. The beverage giant has increased its dividend for 62 consecutive years, earning it recognition as a Dividend King and making it one of the most reliable dividend payers in the consumer staples sector. This remarkable track record demonstrates management's unwavering commitment to returning capital to shareholders through various economic cycles. The company's dividend sustainability is rooted in its asset-light business model, substantial brand equity, and extensive global distribution network. Coca-Cola's focus on higher-margin concentrate sales, combined with strategic partnerships with bottling companies worldwide, generates predictable cash flows that support consistent dividend payments. Warren Buffett's long-term investment in Coca-Cola reflects his appreciation for businesses with pricing power, brand strength, and the ability to compound shareholder wealth over decades through reliable dividend growth. American Express Company stands out as a unique financial services provider within Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, offering investors exposure to both the payments industry and premium consumer spending trends. With a dividend yield of 1.03% and trading at $319 per share, American Express has delivered a solid performance, reflecting the strength of its business model and the successful execution of its growth strategy. The company operates as both a payment network and a card issuer, creating a closed-loop system that generates revenue from multiple sources, including discount fees, interest income, and annual fees. This integrated model enables American Express to exert greater control over the customer experience and generate various revenue streams that support the sustainability of its dividend. The company's focus on affluent customers and premium card products has proven remarkably resilient, as these segments tend to maintain spending levels even during economic uncertainties. American Express's forward dividend of $3.28 per share demonstrates the company's commitment to returning capital to shareholders while maintaining the financial flexibility needed for continued growth investments. The company has consistently increased its dividend over the years, reflecting strong credit performance, disciplined risk management, and successful expansion into new markets and customer segments. The financial services giant's ability to generate substantial returns on equity supports its dividend policy and provides confidence in the sustainability of future payments. Warren Buffett's long-term investment in American Express dates back several decades, reflecting his appreciation for the company's strong brand, loyal customer base, and ability to generate attractive returns on invested capital. The company's focus on premium customers, combined with its integrated business model and global expansion opportunities, positions it well for continued dividend growth. American Express's strong capital position and conservative approach to credit risk management make it an attractive dividend stock for investors seeking exposure to the financial services sector. Citigroup rounds out our list of top Berkshire Hathaway dividend stocks, offering investors a 2.63% dividend yield and representing Warren Buffett's confidence in the banking sector's long-term prospects. Trading at around $85 per share, Citigroup has been undergoing a comprehensive transformation under its current management, focusing on simplifying its business model and enhancing operational efficiency. As one of the largest global banks, Citigroup operates across multiple business lines, including consumer banking, institutional clients, and global markets. The bank's international presence provides geographic diversification and exposure to the growth of emerging markets, while its institutional banking franchise serves multinational corporations and financial institutions worldwide. This diversified business model helps stabilize earnings and supports dividend sustainability through various economic cycles. Citigroup's forward dividend of $2.24 per share reflects management's commitment to returning capital to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital levels to meet regulatory requirements and support business growth. The bank has been working to improve its operational efficiency and risk management capabilities, which should support more consistent earnings and dividend payments over time. Recent regulatory improvements and strategic focus on core businesses position the bank for enhanced profitability and shareholder returns. The bank's dividend policy strikes a balance between maintaining strong capital ratios and meeting shareholder return expectations, reflecting the regulatory environment in which large banks operate. Citigroup's substantial book value and improving operational metrics provide a foundation for dividend sustainability, while its global franchise and diversified revenue streams offer potential for future dividend growth. Warren Buffett's investment in Citigroup demonstrates his confidence in the banking sector's ability to generate attractive returns and support reliable dividend payments for long-term investors. Bottom Line These five Berkshire Hathaway dividend stocks represent a compelling mix of reliable income generators spanning multiple sectors and investment themes. From Chevron's energy sector leadership and attractive 4.78% yield to Apple's technology-driven cash generation capabilities, each stock offers unique advantages for income-focused investors. Coca-Cola's 62-year dividend growth streak exemplifies the type of consistent wealth-building opportunities that Warren Buffett seeks. Meanwhile, American Express and Citigroup offer exposure to financial services through their respective dividend yields of 1.03% and 2.63%. Together, these holdings demonstrate how Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio construction philosophy naturally leads to high-quality dividend-paying investments that can form the foundation of a robust income strategy.

Title: The stock market's biggest bet is setting investors up for a smackdown

Wall Street really needs AI to live up to the hype. A lot has been said about the emerging technology's world-changing potential: Its ability to create stunningly realistic images and videos, ace the LSAT and the MCAT, and complete rote research tasks. You could argue it's ready to augment — or even replace — entry-level jobs. These features have investors up and down the Street very excited. Staunch supporters like Fundstrat's Tom Lee and Wedbush's Dan Ives say AI could revolutionize the human experience. Research desks from big banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have given subtler nods to the prospect of AI as a productivity and profit booster, which could provide an undercurrent to stock market success over the next several years. In fact, analysts are counting on the AI mania to fuel the market even as the White House's chaotic trade policy eats into corporate America's profit potential. Earnings for S&P 500 companies are projected to grow 8% this year, a fairly average showing for an anything-but-average year. What is notable is just how much of that growth relies on the tech sector: Silicon Valley companies are expected to boost their earnings by 21% — the highest growth of any sector. By contrast, profits for retailers are forecast to grow a measly 2.5%. Within the tech sector, semiconductor companies — one of the most globally exposed industries on the stock market — are expected to supercharge profit this year, with a projected climb of 49%. This enthusiasm is a signal Wall Street is betting that demand for AI's use cases will supersede tariff turmoil or job market wobbles. AI's growth has been incredible, and its adoption has been strong enough to leave its fingerprints on economic data sets like business investment and manufacturing spending. Yet no matter how rabid the world is about AI's possibilities, the amount that investors are relying on the tech to fuel the market's gains — especially in the face of rising economic uncertainty — feels short-sighted. Tech stocks helped the market recover from its April malaise, yet earnings expectations and economic momentum are even weaker than they were at the lowest point of the sell-off. This combination leaves the stock market in a precarious spot: Either AI needs to live up to the hype, or investors could be looking at a gnarly second half of the year. One way to tell the story of human history is through our technology — the lightbulb, the calculator, the tractor, the computer all stand as markers to our societal progress and have helped drive the level of efficiency and productivity we enjoy. Tech has perhaps played an equally prominent role in our investment portfolios. The Magnificent Seven stocks — Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia — are collectively worth $18 trillion, or about 33% of the S&P 500's total market value. Together, their stock prices have increased 330% over the past five years, compared with a 100% rise in the S&P 500. It makes sense. Big Tech's products have become deeply integrated into our daily lives, and that level of ubiquity has also captured Wall Street's attention. Venture capital fundraising reached a record in the first quarter amid a huge appetite for AI investment, and S&P 500 companies mentioned AI more than tariffs on second-quarter conference calls. The $65 trillion US stock market may be particularly gripped by Big Tech's ups and downs these days, but it hasn't always been this way. Tech has averaged about 20% of the S&P 500's market value over the past decade, including 13% in the five years before COVID. The dominance is not set in stone, and while the wider market's fortunes are tied to tech now, that may not always be the case. While the stock market may seem like one big proxy for the tech sector's explosive growth right now, there is one deeper connection that should draw investors' attention. Over time, the S&P 500 has been attached at the hip to the fate of the broader US economy. Eight of the past 12 market crashes — S&P drops of 20% or more — overlapped with recessions. No matter how high-flying an industry is, recessions tend to pull stock prices and business hopes back to Earth. The internet revolutionized the world in the late 1990s, and the explosion in social media dominated the 2010s, but the information sector has shed employees and seen share prices fall in the past three recessions. Given that setup, we've set the stage for a portfolio smackdown of the ages. Economists are worried a recession is coming, yet investors are surprisingly upbeat about AI's prospects — so upbeat that they've bid S&P 500 tech stocks to nearly a record high. Sell-side analysts who evaluate company-level trends are similarly optimistic. But in the real economy, layoffs are growing, and hiring has ground to a halt. The sharply diverging views between economists and stock analysts mean someone has to be wrong. The freight train that is AI adoption — a three-year story of rapid innovation and progress — could collide with a massive wall from historic tariffs, high interest rates, and low consumer confidence. What's particularly rich about this is that tech companies are the most exposed sector to global tariffs. They gather the highest percentage of revenue internationally, plus they have the most suppliers and factories outside US borders. In fact, semiconductor companies — the firms providing chips for AI technology — are expected to hit that aforementioned 49% earnings growth despite generating 67% of their revenue abroad and sourcing 70% of their supplies from overseas. Some analysts believe that if AI hopes can keep the stock market chugging along, maybe it can do the same to the economy. After all, companies invested an inflation-adjusted $2.2 trillion on computers and other processing equipment last quarter, about one-seventh of the $16 trillion Americans spent on goods and services. Investing more in AI does ultimately help boost the economy, but that $2 trillion is peanuts compared with the real engine of the US economy. Americans' spending accounts for about 70% of GDP — by far the biggest driver of output — and spending has dropped in each of the past nine recessions. If tariffs intimidate consumers and lead to layoffs that decimate American incomes, then the economy is probably bound for a crisis — whether the robots pan out or not. And based on history, an economic crisis could topple the stock market. The math shows us that AI isn't much of a match for some effects of tariffs and may not logistically be enough to save the economy from ruin. Your portfolio's outcome may be a different story, though. This is when I have to introduce you to one of the most frustrating adages of investing: The stock market is not the economy. The economy is the value that we create — the hard assets, the cash spent, the paychecks we get. Stocks are an expression of that value, but they use the present reality to project future expectations. AI's impact on the economy may not bear out through numbers. But in your portfolio, AI's influence depends on how willing we are to collectively dream up better days ahead in terms of what AI is capable of and how much money AI-dominant firms will amass in the years to come. Dreaming is already a big part of the AI trade. S&P 500 tech companies' estimated earnings grew about 50% in 2023 and 2024, yet their share prices jumped 112%. Nothing is cut-and-dried when it comes to the stock market. It is the ultimate tangled web of logic, psychology, and mixed incentives. The stock market's future depends on investors' ability to dream, and people are willing to dream when they feel confident in the present moment. The problem is, investors are awfully confident about tech stocks right now. S&P 500 tech companies made up about 23% of total index profits in the first quarter, yet their shares account for 32% of the S&P 500's value. To close that gap, tech profits would have to grow 40%, or tech stocks would have to drop 29% from their end-of-June levels. Stocks can thrive when expectations are higher than reality, but in these conditions, they require reasons to stay hopeful. The problem arises when investors aren't willing to dream. When they're too focused on present issues to give compelling stories the benefit of the doubt. Or in big market drops, crushed by financial strain. Then, the numbers matter. People claw for any concrete evidence of AI's value. They demand proof of profits, even though companies are spending money on a pivot to the next big thing. Stock prices adjust, and if you hold a swath of US stocks or index funds, your money is probably heavily exposed to this reality check. This is what happened in 2000. Investors were willing to dream about this brave new technology called the World Wide Web until interest rates climbed too high and the reality of how much computing was needed for Y2K was found to be way overblown. Suddenly, the dream died, and tech stock prices came back down to reality. These days, we all know that dream wasn't completely off base. Yet share prices took an 80% crash before the promise of the new tech came to fruition. This is what I worry about the most in the clash between AI and the economy. We're somewhere between AI saving the world and being an overhyped bust of a technology that can be ripped off by another country. I'm not foolish enough to call this a bubble, and I think AI will eventually deliver benefits for our economy. We're not there yet, though, even though investors like to think so. It takes years for big technological trends to take hold, and productivity usually shines through when workers feel empowered and companies feel comfortable expanding. That's far from the case right now — business confidence is in the dumps, so we're in the opposite scenario. When the economy is getting weaker, it's best to grasp onto what's real in your portfolio. And there's a striking gap between AI and reality.

Title: Kiwi crime-fighting software firm Auror gets big tick from UK Govt, medtech Formus Labs nears commercial launch in the US - Tech Insider

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is urging more retailers to adopt Auror's crime reporting and intel-sharing platform. Image / Getty Creative The Labour Government in the UK has a Kiwi software firm at the heart of its retail crime crackdown. Auckland medtech startup Formus Labs is about to crack the US market open - and be big in Japan. A conference hears that medtech is becoming a multibillion-dollar earner for NZ. One of our fastest-growing software firms just got a major profile boost in the United Kingdom, where it’s positioned to play a role in retail crime crackdown. Over the weekend, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper - whose portfolios includes policing - said shoplifters are to be barred from stores and prosecuted under plans for the first national database of repeat offenders. And it looks like a crime-reporting software platform made by Auckland-based Auror will play a key role in keeping the new database up-to-date. Cooper said she wanted more UK retailers to use Auror’s software, which aims to make it easier for retailers to report offences to police, including photos, and snippets of video taken on their cameras. The Home Secretary is urging police to make greater use of facial recognition technology and is behind the bill, currently winding its way through the UK Parliament. The controversial bill makes it an offence to conceal your identity from CCTV under certain circumstances (including protests), introduces the new offence of assaulting a retail worker and makes theft from a shop trial-able, regardless of the value of the goods (from a £200 [$450] threshold today). Stores including M&S, Morrisons, Boots, Tesco, Primark, and Greggs are submitting CCTV, photos and personal data on all their repeat shoplifters to Auror’s platform, which is shared with police. Cooper endorsed the Kiwi software after receiving a briefing from Boots, according to the UK’s Telegraph. Additionally, two Auror executives were recently invited to 10 Downing Street: UK and Europe vice president Mark Gleeson (a former tactical commander with the Royal Air Force) and UK director of law enforcement and partnerships Paul Fagg (who began his career as a police constable for London’s Metro Police and rose to become a police inspector with the National Business Crime Centre before joining Auror last year). Fagg said his firm’s crime intelligence platform enabled retailers to record everything that happens in their stores to tackle the “huge under-reporting issue”. “Police have access to Auror so that incidents they did not see before are now visible for them,” he said, adding that this enabled police and retailers to identify prolific offenders with CCTV and photographic evidence. The shared data enables all the stores and police to “join the dots” to identify prolific offenders, gather evidence for prosecutions and provide security staff on the shop doors with photo watchlists to bar entry, Fagg said. Auror says its system is used by 98% of retailers in NZ and 75% in Australia. In November last year, the Kiwi firm raised $82m at a $500m valuation, with the funds earmarked, in part, for a push to further expand in the US. The raise was led by two new investors: Axon Enterprise (formerly Taser International) and W23, a venture fund backed by five retailers including Tesco and Woolworths. Nasdaq-listed Axon – which has a US$70 billion ($115b) market cap – invented the Taser in the 1970s. In the 2000s it expanded into bodycams, then computer-aided dispatch software and a cloud-based digital evidence platform. The firm was already an Auror technology partner. On June 4, Axon and Auror announced a new Retail Crime Hub, which they billed as “unlocking a more efficient way for North American law enforcement agencies to collaborate with retailers and stop crime in our communities”. Auror already had a substantial beachhead in the US through anchor customer Walmart, founder Phil Thomson said. The new Retail Crime Hub should help it extend its reach. Thomson said a key issue was that while NZ has a single law enforcement authority (the police) dealing with retail crime, in the US it varied not just by state but by locality with some 18,000 agencies at the country level. Auror is pitched as a conduit to link them together for intel on retail crimes that fly well under the radar of national enforcement agencies. The fast-growing Auror has drawn a degree of privacy flak on both sides of the Tasman with a system that uses digital images which can misidentify people. But the firm has kept its nose clean with our Privacy Commissioner. Thomson emphasises that Auror doesn’t operate any security cameras and does not offer live facial recognition. Privacy Commissioner Michael Webster recently gave facial recognition trials by our two major supermarket chains his cautious tick of approval. And Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says the option of having a centralised system of facial recognition is something he expects officials to consider. “We [Auror] acknowledge the calls from groups like Retail NZ, the UK Home Secretary, and NZ Government, for the use of technology such as facial recognition technology [FRT] in the retail sector,” Thomson told Tech Insider earlier today. “We support the responsible use of FRT by retailers to protect workers, shoppers and communities from violence and harm.” Thomson knows the legal and philosophical ins-and-outs (he’s a former intellectual property lawyer with Simpson Grierson and an ex-board member of the public-interest focused NZ Council of Legal Education). But he says his support for FRT is based on what’s happening every day in the real world. “With retail violence continuing to rise, it’s a no-brainer for retailers to explore how this technology [FRT] can be responsibly used in their stores. It’s already used in everyday environments such as airports, hotels and casinos,” he says. “Due to the increase in violence and crime in stores, in my view, it’s now not a matter of ‘if’ or ‘when’ - it’s about ‘how’ this can be deployed in the best way possible, protecting communities while also protecting privacy. “Retail crime isn’t victimless - it’s violence, it’s assault, and it’s organised. We know one in 10 events involve violence or use of a weapon. Ten % of top repeat offenders are responsible for more than 60% of the crime in Kiwi stores. Furthermore, repeat offenders are up to four times more likely to be violent.” Auckland-based med-tech Formus Labs will commercially launch in the key US market in a couple of months, founder and chief executive Dr Ju Zhang says. The launch follows the start-up gaining US Food and Drug Administration approval in December for its AI-powered, 3D software for planning orthopaedic surgeries - specifically hip replacements, with its FDA green light. Formus is lining up deals with the likes of hospital chains and insurance firms. Zhang says his firm has pilots already under way with several “tier one” and “tier two” players - with revenue above US$1 billion ($1.65b) or in the hundreds of millions, respectively. The start-up already has a close relationship with one of the biggest names in the field - Indiana-based Zimmer Biomet, with whom it’s partnered with in Australia since 2019. Zhang says with major commercial revenue just months away, there are no plans for another sizeable raise, though it’s possible Formus will stage a small round for bridging. (Its last major raise was US$5m ($8.25m) in early in a round led by Global From Day 1 and supported by Icehouse Ventures, Pacific Channel, Flying Kiwis and Punakaiki Fund). The FDA approval was a breakthrough moment as many regulators around the world take their lead from the US agency, Zhang says. Japan - a major market for orthopaedic technology - will be next cab-off-the-rank for the multi-Hi-Tech Awards winner. Australia is also a major market. Zhang says Formus consults closely with several orthopaedic surgeons in NZ but commercial maths means the primary focus has been across the Tasman and in North America. Regardless, he and his crew of 16 staff are based in Auckland, which he anticipated will remain the hub of the firm’s R&D. There’s a lot that’s high-tech about joint replacement surgery these days. But there’s also a lot of drilling, scraping, sawing and hammering. “In some ways, it’s a lot like carpentry,” Zhang says. Formus Lab’s software helps a surgeon more quickly and accurately prepare, and pick the right size joint replacement from what can run into hundreds of options. Currently one in 10 operations have to be redone and one in five have some degree of post-op complication. At a HealthTech Week event in Auckland last week, the audience heard that New Zealand’s MedTech sector currently generates around $2.6b in annual revenue and is projected to reach $3.8b by 2028, a compound annual growth rate of 7.8% since 2018, according to Technology Investment Network, TIN200 stats. “It’s still dominated by the big fish; the likes of F&P Healthcare,” Callaghan Innovation HealthTech head Andrew Clews told Tech Insider. “But there is a second tier of companies coming through now that we’re supporting.” Clews says venture capital money is coming on board and the number of start-ups is increasing - thanks in part to a tight-knit ecosystem. Formus Labs is one of several medtechs spun out of Auckland University’s Bioengineering Institute, for example, he said. Others include Kitea Health, the maker of a world-first wireless implant for measuring brain pressure, Toku Eyes and Alimetry. The event was arranged by Te Tītoki Mataora, funded by Auckland University and MBIE and Callaghan Innovation’s HealthTech Activator. Both programmes offer various forms of support for medtech start-ups, although Callaghan Innovation is being disestablished. With most staff already laid off, the HealthTech Activator has funding to last through until a new advanced research agency is created around this time next year. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team. He joined the Herald in 2018 and is the technology editor and a senior business writer.

Title: After a Year of High-stakes Financing, Saks Turns Back to High-stakes Retailing

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The luxury department store has access to the funds it needs to operate now; the question is how well it will square up to a tough retail market. Deputy Managing Editor The year since Saks and Neiman Marcus Group cut their landmark $2.7 billion deal has been dominated not by talk of a new luxury retail giant or a modern merchant force taking shape. Instead, it’s been all about the rough and tumble of high-stakes corporate finance. On that score, it’s been a story of quick and agile dealmaking that would be surprising or just unbelievable from almost anyone else but Richard Baker, executive chairman of what is now Saks Global. Related Articles Financial S&P Cuts Saks Global's Credit Rating to CC Fashion Features From Sex Clubs to Castles, Latex to Upcycling, Berlin Fashion Week Had Something for Everyone Consider this: You May Also Like And then things really got started. Hudson’s Bay was spun off and went bankrupt, Saks and Neiman’s vendors were thrown into a tailspin by a yearlong schedule to repay past due bills and 90-day payment terms on all shipments going forward. And bondholders — some of whom seem to haven’t bothered to read some very important fine print — revolted when they learned their debt wasn’t directly secured by the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship. Saks then lined up $350 million in new financing in May only to ditch that in favor of $600 million in financing last month from a group of bondholders jockeying for a better position in the capital structure. From the outside, the company has appeared to be lurching from one crisis to the next. And from the inside, it’s seemingly been a nightmare. But last week, new money in hand, Saks made a crucial $120 million interest payment on the bonds. It’s said to be paying vendors on time under the new terms and Marc Metrick, chief executive officer, has even floated the possibility of making back payments earlier than planned. “As we progress over the next few months, if we see a return to what we believe to be normalized receipt flow, we plan to evaluate the possibility of accelerating the timeline to pay back past due balances to our brand partners,” Metrick told vendors in a memo last month that was obtained by WWD. At least for now, the Saks story is no longer a tale about financing. Everyone inside and out agrees that Saks has the money to get through this year and sources close to the company maintain that it has the financial wherewithal to last much longer even if Christmas doesn’t turn out to be a blockbuster season. One source said Saks’ outside auditors gave the company a clean bill of health — good for at least a year — after the $350 million in financing was lined up and now that’s been upsized to a potential total of $600 million, giving it even more cushion. Right now, the future of Saks is not about its ability to wrangle investors or lenders, but the company’s retail savvy and its ability to push what Metrick has called a “reset” of luxury retail through an increasingly complicated retail market. “All we heard about is ‘We’re running out of money,'” said Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire, summing up the bondholder take on the company. “’We need money for inventory, we need money to make interest payments.’ Money, money, money. So OK, we got you set up, you told us you needed this much money, now you show us that you know what to buy and you bought the right inventory and you know how to sell it to make a reasonable profit.” That’s the trick in retail anyway — and one that requires finesse in good times and real skill in tough ones, like now when consumers are skittish and President Donald Trump’s trade war is still disrupting supply. Big retail mergers are dicey to start with. “Now, they have control of the best high-end retailers,” Hynes said. “In theory it should work out. Nobody’s going to open a new high-end retailer tomorrow. It’s just not going to happen. So they got the market cornered. In theory, if anything’s going to work, this should work. Everybody says, ‘Rich people always have money, this should work out.’ However, if you look at history, combining retailers has never worked out.” That point could be argued, kind of — the Federated-May mega merger worked for a time and changed the retail landscape, but that company, now Macy’s Inc., is now morphing again for a new age. But nobody argues that Saks is working in a tough space. “Department stores are not the best neighborhood to be operating in,” said Mickey Chadha, the Moody’s Investors Service debt analyst who follows Saks. “They’re relying on cost cuts, layoffs, efficiencies between the two companies,” Chadha said. “And that’s all great. If you can accomplish that, you’re definitely better for your bottom line. However, you have to grow, you have to grow. And their sales have been declining quite dramatically in the last couple of years. So if you don’t grow, there’s only so much you can do in synergies and cost cuts. “This $600 million of new monies that we’re talking about is great,” he said. “It gives them more runway to get the ship back on course. But it’s not going to be the end all. If they continue to burn cash, that $600 million will then disappear again in the next 12 months, and then they’ll need more capital. The holiday is going to be key for them.” Holiday, next year and beyond relies not on raising more money or courting investors, but on making the big Saks reset work. It’s a complicated bit of work for Metrick. Saks Global is combining operations for the two nameplates, reestablishing trust with vendors, cementing the new payment terms, expanding through a luxury shop on Amazon and looking at brands in new ways with its Authentic Luxury Group joint venture. Somewhere in there could be a bright future for the idea of the luxury department store, which has suffered blow after blow since the bankruptcy of Barneys New York in 2019. There is no shortage of brands with real gripes against Saks as it just now starts paying bills due years ago. But some luxury labels are also sensing new potential ahead — and brands both large and small say Saks Global is vital to their businesses and its survival is key. One adviser to independent designer brands said they are getting more excited about Saks’ shop on Amazon, which launched with 50 brands and is said to be bringing new shoppers into the business. “Are we going to actually see more sales through e-commerce than we’re seeing in the physical stores?” the adviser wondered. “How does the retail footprint shrink or change?” That refocuses the narrative around Saks back to where it really should be — its retail fortunes.
