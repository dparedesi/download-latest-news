Title: Argentina First? Trump Treasury Sec Reveals Bailout Amount Has Doubled

One day after Donald Trump celebrated a multibillion-dollar bailout for Argentina, his administration moved to double the ante. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters at the Treasury building Wednesday that the United States is “working on a $20 billion facility that would be adjacent” to the $20 billion credit swap line Trump already approved, totaling $40 billion in assistance for the economically fragile South American country. “Many banks are interested in it, and many sovereign funds,” Bessent said. “It is a private-sector solution to Argentina’s upcoming debt payments.” The aid is intended to salvage Argentina’s collapsing economy ahead of the country’s October 26 midterm elections. That vote will determine if Argentine President Javier Milei, one of Trump’s international allies, will maintain the ability to pursue his dramatic cost-cutting agenda. But there’s another notable beneficiary of the Trump admin’s Argentina bailout package: major hedge funds led by Bessent’s friends. Several major investment funds, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Pimco, stand to significantly gain from the aid transfer, as do several independent investors with ties to Bessent, The New York Times reported earlier this month. Bessent described the exchange Wednesday as an “economic Monroe Doctrine,” referring to the 1823 policy that rejected European intervention and colonialism in the Western hemisphere. “Much better to use the heft of the U.S. economic power rather than have to use military power,” Bessent continued, comparing the situation to the supposed “narco traffic coming out of Venezuela.” But the White House’s planned Argentina bailout is remarkably hypocritical for an administration that has axed critical executive agencies under the auspice of slashing spending. Stateside, the government is still shut down over how to fund Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget, which included cuts of billions from Obamacare subsidies and Medicaid—a shutdown that Bessent himself claimed Wednesday was costing America “$15 billion a day.” And the U.S. will likely need a bailout of its own very soon. American soybean farmers have been pummeled by Trump’s tariff policies, which have ripped the Chinese market from their grasp. However, after it came to light that Argentina had replaced the U.S. as China’s top soybean supplier, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that the anticipated Argentina-bound cash infusion had morphed into a “credit swap line.” House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested that harassment, assault, and stolen valor allegations against Republican Representative Cory Mills are not “serious” matters of discussion at a Wednesday press conference. A Florida judge on Tuesday issued a restraining order against Mills, after his ex-girlfriend alleged that he had threatened to blackmail her using sexually explicit images of her and to commit violence against her future romantic partners. Johnson bristled at reporters after being asked twice about the matter. Responding to a question from NBC News’s Melanie Zanona, Johnson initially claimed to have “not heard or looked into the details of that.” NOTUS’s Reese Gorman followed up, noting additional scandals—two out of a bevy of others—that Mills has faced, i.e., a different woman once accused him of assaulting her at his apartment, which she since recanted, and Mills, an Army veteran, has also been accused of stolen valor, including by military veterans who served alongside him. “Are you concerned about these allegations?” Gorman asked. Johnson told him to ask Mills, whom he called “a faithful colleague,” before pleading ignorance of the allegations. “Let’s talk about things that are really serious,” said the speaker, growing cross, before taking another question. Federal agents arrested a Portland mother who was playing the “Ghostbusters” theme song on her clarinet at a protest outside an ICE facility. Oriana Korol, 38, is a member of the Unpresidented Brass Band, which calls itself a “social action oriented, horn driven marching band,” and seeks to deescalate protest tensions. In a video of her arrest from Sunday, a federal agent can be seen violently dragging Korol to the ground, as two more agents come to his aid and her clarinet falls out of her hands. She has been in Clark County Jail in Vancouver, Washington, since, and is still being held without bail. Video of the Portland clarinet player being arrested.Honestly ditching the black bloc in favor of silly costumes, naked bike rides & brass bands is politically quite ingenious. It makes ICE look utterly foolish in any footage that appears on the news average Joe watches. pic.twitter.com/FY87x9xKGr “Out of the corner of my eye, I saw someone running, and then a federal officer running after them. By the time I turned around, this person had been tackled to the ground, and there was an officer on top of them,” said Mike Thompson, Korol’s bandleader. “This was happening right at Oriana’s feet. And she was kind of, they were kind of pinned against a fence,” he said. Korol’s husband didn’t know she’d been transported across state lines until 2 a.m. the next morning. “It is a beautiful party atmosphere. Everybody’s really excited. Then the band hits into ‘Ghostbusters,’ and then at ‘Ghostbusters,’ that’s when ICE start storming in,” Korol’s husband told KOIN 6. “Why are they targeting a clarinet player? A clarinet player standing on the sidewalk far away from the street, following instructions. “We’re not seeing her. We don’t know when we’re going to see her again,” he added, referring to himself and their 3-year-old child. This arrest is yet another example of the excessive, indiscriminate, and in some instances unlawful actions that the federal agents who’ve flooded American cities in the past few months have taken. On Tuesday, federal agents in Chicago violated a freshly minted temporary restraining order banning them from tear-gassing civilians, also gassing local police officers in the process. The Portland Mutual Aid Network has called for Korol’s release, urging supporters to call the Clark County Jail. “Oriana Korol was peacefully protesting ICE on 10/12 and was illegally detained by ICE and DHS,” their statement reads. “She is the clarinet player for Unpresidented Brass Band, and was playing music for protestors. Protesting for immigrants is not a crime!” Republicans are rushing to recast upcoming protests against President Donald Trump as anti-American rallies that are somehow prolonging the government shutdown. During an interview on CNBC Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent blamed the Democrats for a lack of movement on reopening the federal government, claiming that they were waiting to move until after the “No Kings Day” rally planned for October 18 opposing the administration’s authoritarian tilt. “There’s a thought out there that they’re at least waiting to get this crazy ‘No Kings’ rally this weekend, which is gonna be the farthest left, the hardest-core, the most unhinged in the Democratic Party which is, you know, a big title,” Bessent claimed. “You know, no kings equal no paychecks,” he added. During a propaganda press conference later Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson framed the upcoming “No Kings Day” as a “Hate America rally.” “Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson said. “I bet you see pro-Hamas supporters. I bet you see antifa types. I bet you see the Marxists in full display. The people who don’t want to stand and defend the foundational truths of this republic, and that’s what we’re here doing every single day.” Other Republicans were quick to join Johnson, with Representatives Steve Scalise and Lisa McClain also referring to the protest as the “Hate America rally.” Johnson started the trend of villainizing constitutionally protected protest last week when he inexplicably claimed that the “No Kings Day” demonstration was somehow to blame for the government shutdown. “It’s being told to us that they won’t be able to reopen the government until after that rally, ’cuz they can’t face their rabid base,” Johnson said of Democrats at the time. For the past three weeks, GOP lawmakers have been phoning in that whole defending-the-Republic thing, ever since Johnson sent them home amid the ongoing government shutdown. It seems clear that it’s Republicans who have refused to negotiate with Democrats—not the other way around. Crucially, Republicans are blatantly mischaracterizing the attendees of the nationwide “No Kings” rally, in an attempt to criminalize dissent against Trump. These protests, which have been recurring since the beginning of the second Trump administration, have been notably tame, reportedly populated by older, liberal white people who love America but hate Trump’s policies. The temperate collective action would likely not be left enough for anyone who was ostensibly anti-fascist. Republicans’ outlandish predictions for who is likely to attend are simply setting the stage for law enforcement crackdowns on protesters’ First Amendment rights. The speaker’s suggestion that protesting the government is un-American is particularly disturbing, as it is not only a historically American activity, but also a foundational right supported by the U.S. Constitution—a right that Republicans such as Johnson seem to care about less and less everyday. The largest political advertisement spender of the year is: you, the U.S. taxpayer. While the rest of the Trump administration hatchets away at the federal budget, the Department of Homeland Security has gone on a spending spree to heap praise on Donald Trump. The agency has so far spent at least $51 million in 2025 on a sprawling ad campaign warning undocumented immigrants to either exit the country or be “hunted down.” Fox News bought the bulk of the ad spots, airing $9 million worth of content, Axios reported Wednesday. America’s morning shows saw the most program-specific spending, with Today, CBS Morning, and Good Morning America leading the pack. Over the course of the last month, viewers of three programs consumed the most DHS advertising: the Mexican soccer league (Fútbol: Liga MX), Fox’s The Five, and Univision’s Despierta America. But the campaign has also had a digital arm targeting social media users. The ads have specifically targeted Spanish speakers and users who like Mexican pop music, Latin music, the Mexican Grand Prix, Latin cuisine, and the Mexican national soccer team, according to Meta ad library data obtained by Axios. Almost all the adverts feature DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. Directly facing the camera, Noem suggests that undocumented immigrants are “violent criminals” flooding American cities with drugs, and accuses the Biden administration of taking a weak stance on border crossings. (Joe Biden increased border enforcement across the board and arrested an “unprecedented” number of immigrants that crossed illegally, according to the libertarian think tank Cato Institute.) One detail is consistent across all the DHS adspots: unmitigated applause for the current president’s agenda. “Strong borders mean a stronger America. President Trump is making America safe again,” Noem says at the end of one advert. Compare that to DHS’s last ad campaign under the Biden administration: a series of billboards in Texas that read a person “in immigration custody has rights.” That campaign cost $150,000, and did not feature President Joe Biden or former DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. In a now infamous September raid on a 130-unit apartment building in Chicago, hundreds of agents reportedly rappelled in from helicopters, kicked in doors, ransacked rooms, deployed flashbangs, and zip-tied people—immigrants and native Chicagoans, adults and children—in the middle of the night. Amid growing criticism of this heavy-handed blitz, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller defended the operation, calling it a “brilliantly executed raid against a Tren de Aragua complex filled with TdA terrorists.” (Tren de Aragua, or TdA, is a Venezuelan gang that the Trump administration, with characteristic alarmism, claims has “invaded the United States.”) So, how many members of the Venezuelan gang did they catch in the controversial September raid? DHS says that, of the 37 individuals arrested that night, agents got ahold of “just one ‘verified’ Tren de Aragua member,” MSNBC reported this week. It was previously reported that two of the 37 arrested were members of TdA, but even that disappointing figure was evidently overstating it. Further, DHS has yet to provide proof of the alleged gang member’s connection to TdA—a point worth noting, since the Trump administration has faced criticism for advancing weak claims of immigrants’ gang membership in service of its mass deportation campaign. This new finding lends itself to the conclusions Illinois Governor JB Pritzker shared in his recent conversation with TNR’s Greg Sargent about the raid: “If this was Pinochet’s Chile, if this was Argentina under authoritarian rule, maybe you’d call it successful,” he said, adding later, “Whenever the [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and [Customs and Border Protection] agents say something, they put out a release or, you know, you’ve got Stephen Miller talking about it, they are lying.” Federal agents ended up tear-gassing Chicago police officers on Tuesday while trying to perform basic crowd control, violating a temporary restraining order banning the very use of tear gas in the process. A crowd of community members and protesters formed near 105th and Avenue N, where Border Patrol struck a civilian car while trying to arrest the people inside. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said that the crowd “eventually turned hostile,” forcing them to use “crowd control measures” like tear gas. CPD officers present were caught in the crossfire. About 13 officers were exposed to the tear gas, Chicago police said. This is the second time CPD officers have been gassed by ICE while trying to work with them. The federal agents are also blatantly ignoring the temporary restraining order sent down from Judge Sara Ellis on October 9, after journalists and community organizations brought the issue forward. Ellis explicitly banned the agents from “using riot control weapons,” “firing [tear gas] canisters,” “using force, such as pulling or shoving a person to the ground, tackling, or body slamming an individual,” “striking any person with a vehicle,” and more abuses of power. The order applies to all agents from the Department of Homeland Security, including ICE and Border Patrol, and was supposed to last until October 23. The federal agents violated it almost immediately. Civilians have continued to be terrorized by these riot tactics. “The eyes and the nose ... it burned,” community member Pascal Manuel told NBC 5 Investigates. “This type of escalation is going to cause harm—it’s not the people of Chicago. It is the federal agents,” said Beatriz Ponce De Leon, Chicago’s deputy mayor of immigration and refugee rights. There is currently no update on the status of the temporary restraining order. Republican Senator Tim Sheehy of Montana appeared dumbstruck Tuesday night after his ridiculous attempts to blame Democrats for massive funding cuts to energy projects blew up in his face. During an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Sheehy was asked about the $1 billion grant that the Department of Energy pulled from the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, a clean energy project spanning Washington state, Oregon, and Montana. “They just yanked a billion dollars from that. So, is that taking away good paying jobs in Montana?” asked Collins. “Of course it is. As I said, we want the government to be open. You should be saying this to Chuck Schumer, who is closing the government down,” Sheehy replied. “I’m agreeing we should have the government open right now, this is an unnecessary shutdown.” Collins pressed whether Sheehy was acknowledging that President Donald Trump’s administration was hurting his state, prompting the Republican to launch into an unrelated list of federal services interrupted by the government shutdown. “So, this shutdown is not a good thing, and that’s why we don’t want it to continue,” he said. Collins tried to steer Sheehy back to the topic at hand. “The Trump administration didn’t have to make that decision, they decided to pull that billion dollars from your state,” she said. “Do you disagree with that?” “Well, I think the reality is we wouldn’t be here if the government was still open, and now we’re going on week three of a pretty unnecessary shutdown,” Sheehy repeated. But Energy Secretary Chris Wright had specifically told Collins earlier this month that the canceled grant had nothing to do with the shutdown, or the Democrats, for that matter. “He said they would’ve done that even if the government wasn’t shut down, that that was months in the making even before the government shut down,” Collins said. The two fell silent, as Sheehy’s desperate excuses evaporated. After a long moment, Sheehy replied: “Well, it’s unfortunate we’re still shut down. We shouldn’t be.” COLLINS: The Dept of Energy just canceled a billion dollars for a hydrogen hub that covers your state of Montana. Is that taking away good-paying jobs?SHEEHY: Of course it is. We want the govt to be openCOLLINS: But the Energy Secretary says they would've pulled that funding… pic.twitter.com/6AAfmldQf8 Last week, OMB Director Russell Vought—not Wright—declared that the Trump administration would cut nearly $8 billion in lawfully approved funding for energy projects, targeting 16 Democratic-led states. A longer list of grants to clean energy projects assembled by DOE senior staff totaling roughly $30 billion circulated Capitol Hill, alarming energy advocates and lawmakers, including Republicans whose districts could be affected by the cuts. The fate of the remaining $22 billion, which is mostly earmarked for Republican districts, remains unclear. An opinion on Charlie Kirk could be what keeps people in or out of America. The State Department announced Tuesday it has revoked at least six visas from foreign nationals after their recipients made comments about Kirk in the wake of the far-right youth leader’s assassination. So far, individuals from Mexico, Germany, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, and Paraguay are affected. “The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans,” the State Department wrote on X. “The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk.” Exactly what qualifies for expulsion is not clear, though some of the remarks were notably benign. An Argentine national who had their visa revoked said that Kirk spread “racist, xenophobic, misogynistic rhetoric”—all of which is demonstrably true. That language in particular has even been circulated by House lawmakers in criticizing Kirk’s point of view. In a string of social media posts, the official account for the State Department shared several examples of the comments that caught its attention from individuals “who are no longer welcome in the U.S.” The State Department claimed that nearly all of the examples suggested the commenters were attempting to justify Kirk’s death. “Charlie Kirk was a son of a bitch and he died by his own rules,” wrote the Paraguayan national. A German, writing in German, commented that “when fascists die, democrats don’t complain.” The State Department warned in an X post that “[President Donald Trump] and [Secretary Marco Rubio] will defend our borders, our culture, and our citizens by enforcing our immigration laws.” “Aliens who take advantage of America’s hospitality while celebrating the assassination of our citizens will be removed,” the department wrote. Vice President JD Vance late Tuesday decried “pearl clutching” over a Politico story unearthing a private group chat in which prominent members of Young Republicans chapters called Black people monkeys, spoke approvingly of rape and slavery, and wrote other odious remarks, such as “I love Hitler” and messages containing racial and homophobic slurs. Opting for whataboutism, Vance highlighted unearthed messages by Jay Jones, a Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia, who recently apologized for leaked private messages from August 2022, in which he joked about shooting then-state House Speaker Speaker Todd Gilbert. Jones also said Gilbert would not take action on gun safety unless his children were endangered, writing, “Only when people feel pain personally do they move on policy.” Vance posted a screenshot of the latter comment on X, with the caption: “This is far worse than anything said in a college group chat, and the guy who said it could become the AG of Virginia. I refuse to join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence.” For one, it’s not a matter of fact that Jones’s messages are worse than those of the Young Republicans, who spoke about having their political opponents raped and sent to gas chambers. Vance is also trying to downplay the importance of the messages by claiming they were shared in a “college group chat.” But Young Republicans groups include those between 18 and 40 years old, with members of the reported group chat well into adulthood. The man Politico identifies as “the most prominent voice in the chat spreading racist messages,” for instance, is 31. The members held notable positions in Republican politics, with several leading state affiliates of the GOP’s youth arm. Some worked in state politics, and at least one serves as a state senator. Vance’s tweet exemplifies his time-tested willingness to excuse vitriol in his own ranks, embracing a “no-enemies-to-the-right” stance that is seemingly limitless.

Title: Intel laid me off — and I could see it coming. My third layoff in a decade has been the toughest to bounce back from.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kent Ha, a 37-year-old job seeker in Portland, Oregon, who previously worked as a digital marketing strategist at Intel. He holds a bachelor's degree in new media communications from Oregon State University and an MBA from George Fox University with a concentration in leadership and management. He's looking for product marketing and digital experience roles. Business Insider has verified Ha's past employment with documentation. It has been edited for length and clarity. On July 9, I learned I'd been laid off by Intel. While I enjoyed my five years at the company, I didn't have the reaction some people describe — getting the news, breaking down, and cycling through emotions. Part of the reason is that I saw the layoff coming. In recent years, Intel has conducted thousands of layoffs, which made many of us worried about our job security. When our CEO left the company last December, we were worried that more cuts could be coming. My role fell under the company's sales and marketing group. In the months leading up to July, Intel had taken steps to outsource some of my team's work to another company. That made it seem even more likely that our group would be hit. The other reason the layoff news didn't affect me too much was that I'd already been laid off twice by other companies since 2015 — once during a restructuring and again during the pandemic. By the time it happened a third time, my mindset had already shifted. I'd seen it coming, I knew what it was like to lose a job, and I was already looking for my next role. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: Before I was laid off, I'd started focusing on building my skills in hopes of reducing the chances I'd be let go. But at the same time, I began monitoring the job market to assess the types of roles available. As the company's outlook worsened, I began browsing roles more actively, and it became clear that finding a new job could be challenging. By June, I believed there was a decent chance I'd be let go in the coming months, so I took two steps to prepare. The first was reaching out to my financial advisor. I told them a layoff seemed likely and that the job market looked tough. They advised me not to overreact to something that hadn't happened yet, but said that if I was let go, I should file for unemployment — and that my wife and I should cut back spending on things like eating out and vacations. The second step I took to prepare for the layoff was to start applying for jobs. I figured worst case, I'd land another offer and have a backup plan. Best case, I'd keep my job and wouldn't have to make any changes. It was a contingency plan — that's how I thought about it. As I began searching for jobs, with a focus on product marketing and digital experience positions, I found myself reflecting on the two previous times I'd been laid off. In 2015, I moved from Portland, Oregon, to San Diego for a new role. Six months later, I was let go due to company restructuring. After that layoff, it took me about two and a half months to secure my next role, a three-month contract position. Knowing there wouldn't be a chance for an extension, I kept searching — and was able to find a full-time job that started shortly after the contract ended. In 2020, I was working at a home improvement company that focused on in-home services. When the pandemic hit, those services came to a halt. To cut costs, the company laid off workers — and I was among them. I was fortunate to land a content manager contract role at Intel in less than a month. That role eventually led to a promotion into a full-time digital marketing strategist position, which I held until I was laid off this year. In both 2015 and 2020, I cold-applied to jobs — but what actually worked was posting my résumé on sites like Indeed, CareerBuilder, and Monster. Staffing agencies would reach out, which led to interviews. Compared to my prior layoffs, this job search has been particularly challenging. I'm not having as much luck with those job boards, and when I do hear back, it's usually for entry-level roles. There also seems to be an increase in scams — for example, I recently got an email where the subject line said Audi was hiring, but the body of the message referenced the Marriott Hotel. My other strategies have included updating my résumé — with help from ChatGPT — to ensure it reflects the skill sets needed for the roles I'm targeting. I also strengthened my personal website, hoping to showcase my capabilities to potential employers. I've also reached out to my network to let them know I'm looking for work. I was fortunate to be part of a supportive team at Intel, and even now, many of us continue to share job leads and support each other. That's helped quite a bit. While these strategies have helped me get some interviews, I'm still struggling to land a job. The search has been an emotional roller coaster because there are roles that seem like a perfect fit, and then they go nowhere. I've been fortunate enough to secure some interviews, but it's really difficult to prepare for them and convey the right information within a short timeframe. As I go through my job search, I'm very grateful to my wife, who listens to me talk about companies day in and day out. Knowing how stressful it is for me, she's made us go on nightly walks to decompress. It's also been extremely helpful to have her income coming in — she works in the healthcare industry. I have a few pieces of advice for others who have been laid off: The first is related to your mindset. My first layoff in 2015 hit me hard — I'd just moved to California for the role, and six months later, I lost it. Over time, I realized it wasn't personal. Companies evolve, and so must you. That perspective helped me stay grounded during later layoffs, including this one. Second, find ways to grow. I noticed that one role I was interested in preferred a certified Scrum Product Owner certification, which I was already planning to pursue, so I took the course. I'm now planning to explore AI courses as well to stay current and competitive. And finally: Take a breath. As hard as this is, it might be the only time in your career when you can pause. I remind myself it's a marathon. Having a routine, staying sharp, and preparing for the next opportunity — that's what keeps me going.

ByPeter Greene, Senior Contributor. Stride, a giant in the cyber charter school industry, was accused by a New Mexico school district of violating rules and regulations. Now a lawsuit alleges that Stride responded by mounting a coordinated attack on the district and its superintendent. In 2020, Gallup-McKinley County Schools contracted with Stride (formerly known as K12 Inc) to operate its New Mexico Destinations Career Academy. But the district alleges that the for-profit organization repeatedly cut corners, violated staffing rules, and inflated enrollment numbers. In May 2025, the school board voted to end the contract. "Our students deserve better," said School Board President Christopher Mortensen in a press release. "This action is not sudden; it is the result of months of effort to address persistent issues with the contractor. We are taking this step to protect our students, uphold academic standards, and meet our obligations under state and federal law." Within months, the district had filed a complaint against Stride, charging them with fraud, unfair trade practices, civil conspiracy, and seven other counts. That lawsuit outlines the issues between Stride and the district. According to the complaint, Stride had continuing issues with meeting requirements for student-teacher ratios, having been notified as early as September 2023 that it was out of compliance. Special education teachers were over their permitted caseloads, and IEP students were not receiving their due process. Further, Stride failed to employ certified teachers, complete background checks, or provide state-mandated occupational and professional trainings to their staff. The district also alleges that Stride “retained nonexistent students on its rolls” and took school district funds for educating these ghost students. Stride failed to provide timely required communication with the district. Stride’s graduation rate, says the district, was “horrific,” with a graduation rate of 27.67% in 2024. The district also claims that through it all, Stride has “ignored compliance requirements” and failed to produce a remediation plan. According to the suit filed by the district, a management representative of Stride came forward in May as a whistleblower, declaring that the increases in student-teacher ratios was “intentional… in order to increase profit margins." The whistleblower reported that he made multiple attempts to inform upper management that Stride was out of compliance with state law, and asked for authority to hire the roughly 80 teachers needed. The Vice President of Finance, says the whistleblower, refused to authorize those hires. Instead, in a later meeting, the whistleblower was allegedly told that his “projected profit margin was too low.” He was directed to cut staff for the next year to meet projected profit margin." According to the whistleblower, Stride’s plans to deal with their troubles were not focused on meeting their obligations to the district. Instead, the whistleblower says, at an April meeting Stride’s Senior Vice President of School Development “Peter Stewart said the company should attack first publicly and Stride Inc. should develop a strategy for that” and that Stride CEO “James Rhyu said [to the group] that the Superintendent [for the School District] was in over his skis on this issue.” Alleges the district’s suit, ”Stride’s management, including the individual Defendants, engaged in and agreed to a civil conspiracy to cover up its misconduct and illegal activities acting, by and through its employees, agents and attorneys, in planning and engaging in a systemic public attack on the School District and its Superintendent of Schools to distract from its illegal activities and its breach of the contract with the Board of Education." And counter-attack they did. On April 22, the district sent Stride a letter charging it had “materially breached” its contract. On April 28, the company filed an ethics complaint against GMCS Superintendent Michael Hyatt, alleging that he had tried to leverage Stride’s contract with the district in order to secure a “lucrative position” with Stride. Hyatt had applied for a management position with Stride in 2024; the company declined to hire him. The list of complaints by the district against Stride is long, but the theme is simple enough. Asked for comment on the suit, a Stride representative directed me to the company’s suit-related web site which argues that the company has been working on an improvement plan, that their student-to-staff ratios are better than those reported by the district, and that “explosive growth” of NMDCA makes it hard to stay caught up with staffing. A reply to the district’s Aprill 22 letter contests virtually every point that the district has made about Stride’s performance. Since being cut loose from GMCS, Stride has re-opened NMDCA as a cyber charter school partnered with Charna Valley Independent Schools and Santa Rosa Consolidated Schools; a fact sheet from Stride says 3,000 students are enrolled, including 2,300 returning families. Those families, they say, are largely satisfied with the school. They also point out that many students enter the school short of credits, and that the majority of students are closing that gap. The Stride representative also sent a fact sheet alleging that GMCS is facing other legal problems. But Stride is no stranger to legal issues. It was founded in 2000 as K12 Inc by Ron Packard, former banker and Mckinsey consultant, and quickly became the leading national company for cyber schooling. One of its first big investors was Michal Milken. That investment came a decade after he pled guilty to six felonies in the “biggest fraud case in the securities industry” ending his reign as the “junk bond king.” Besides Milliken, Stride investors have included brothers Lowell and Larry Elison, and BlackRock, founded by Larry Fink, whose brother Steve sits on the Stride Board of Directors. In 2011, the New York Times detailed how K12’s schools were failing miserably, but still making investors and officers a ton of money. Former teachers wrote tell-alls about their experiences. In 2012. Florida caught K12 using fake teachers. The NCAA put K12 schools on the list of cyber schools that were disqualified from sports eligibility. In 2014, Packard turned out to be one of the highest paid public workers in the country, "despite the fact that only 28% of K12 schools met state standards in 2011-2012." In 2013 K12 settled a class action lawsuit in Virginia for $6.75 million after stockholders accused the company of misleading them about “the company’s business practices and academic performance.” In 2014, Middlebury College faculty voted to end a partnership with K12 saying the company’s business practices “are at odds with the integrity, reputation and educational mission of the college.” In 2016 K12 got in yet another round of trouble in California for lying about student enrollment, resulting in a $165 million settlement with then Attorney General Kamala Harris. K12 was repeatedly dropped in some states and cities for poor performance. In 2020, they landed a big contract in Miami-Dade county (after a big lucrative contribution to an organization run by the superintendent); subsequently Wired magazine wrote a story about their "epic series of tech errors." K12 successfully defended itself from a lawsuit in Virginia based on charges they had greatly overstated their technological capabilities by arguing that such claims were simply advertising “puffery.” The district is seeking compensatory and punitive damages from Stride. Four Stride executives are named in the suit in addition to Stride Inc itself. The court will decide who’s blowing smoke here. In the meantime, school districts continue to learn about the price of teaming up with aggressively for-profit partners.

Title: Tech Workers Versus Enshittification

The men who appeared on the dais behind President Trump at his inauguration were never good men. Take Tim Cook. Cook owes his elevation to Apple CEO—which made him a billionaire twice over—to his leadership in moving Apple manufacturing to “iPhone City” in south China.3 Other Apple execs had tried this, but they could never get the precision and reliability Apple demanded. Cook managed it, but the brutal working conditions created by Foxconn, Apple’s contract manufacturer there, led to the installation of suicide nets5 to catch workers who leapt to their death rather than facing another shift. Or look at Jeff Bezos. Workers in Bezos’s warehouses are injured (often critically) at three times the rate of workers in other companies’ warehouses.7 Bezos’s contract drivers have to relieve themselves in bottles because they are not given toilet breaks. They are also monitored by AI cameras that score their eyeball movements.11 Google’s top bosses covered up for a senior manager who allegedly preyed on a female subordinate, whom he subjected to violent sex acts. He was given millions of dollars to go away quietly12 while his victim was prohibited from suing by the “binding arbitration” waivers in her contract. These men have always abused anyone they could get away with abusing. If they seemed to treat some people well—for example, the pampered coders who get gourmet cafeterias, free massages, and all the kombucha they can drink—it was because they feared the difficulties of replacing those workers. Now that U.S. Big Tech has shed more than 400,000 jobs in just two years, there’s a reserve army of desperate techies who can be given the suicide-net-and-urine-bottle treatment. One of the first official acts of the current administration was to cancel every single labor investigation and enforcement action in the entire country.8 The administration’s antitrust boss canceled investigations into predatory pricing (selling goods below cost to drive out competitors) and surveillance pricing (using commercial surveillance data to charge you more (for example, by increasing the price of your breakfast sandwich on payday) or pay you less (for example, offering nurses lower wages if they are known to have overdue credit card bills).10 Instead of helping workers and shoppers resist predatory assaults fueled and perpetrated by Big Tech, Trump’s Federal Trade Commission chair is focusing all his energies on a new snitch line where FTC employees can report “wokeism.”4 The men who run Big Tech have always wanted to “enshittify” their services—to shift as much as they can from users, workers, suppliers, and business customers to themselves. The forces that prevented that—militant, scarce workers; competitors; regulators; and rival technologies—were critically weakened and even eliminated over the past 40 years. Biden’s administration was the first in two generations to take fighting corporate abuses seriously.1 Is it any wonder that Big Tech were all in for his rival? Enshittification would be much, much worse if not for tech workers. Tech workers have historically enjoyed remarkable workplace status—not just the material perks, from dry cleaning to personal trainers, but also the power to tell their bosses to go to hell. When your skills are in such high demand that you can quit your job, walk across the street, and get a better one later that same day, your boss has a real incentive to make you feel like you are their social equal, empowered to say and do whatever feels technically right, or just, you know, show up for work with facial piercings, a green mohawk, and a black t-shirt from Defcon with writing on it that your boss doesn’t understand but still feels uncomfortable about. Tech workers may have given their bosses tsuris and demanded sky-high wages, but at least they were wildly productive. The per-worker revenue for successful tech companies is unfathomable—tens or even hundreds of times their wages and stock compensation packages.2 What’s more, many tech businesses had more work than they could hire skilled workers to perform, so bosses’ strategy focused on getting the workers they could hire to put in longer hours. That strategy has a name: “vocational awe,” a term coined by the librarian-theorist Fobazi Ettarh to describe the grueling hours endured by workers who believe in the social value of their work. Teachers, nurses, librarians—any profession whose practitioners are motivated by a sense of duty is a profession vulnerable to vocational awe. Tech companies have been widely derided for their grandiose mission statements, such as Google’s “organize all the world’s information and make it useful” or Facebook’s “making the world more open and connected.” But whether the management of these companies believed in these high-minded words, they were absolutely internalized by employees, who—despite their job security—worked every hour god sent, sleeping under their desks and missing their parents’ funerals to hit their bosses’ arbitrary deadlines. As a motivational tactic, vocational awe (or, as Elon Musk puts it, “being extremely hardcore”) works very well, but it fails very badly. It turns out that when you actually care about your job, and when your boss can’t replace you, and when you can get a new job whenever you want, it’s damned hard to convince you to wreck the things you built and harm your users, even if that will make your boss more money. For many years, tech workers have been the last line of defense between Internet users and tech bosses, bravely holding the line on enshittification. But once tech started to shed workers en masse—260,000 layoffs in 2023,6 another 160,000 in 20249—the power of workers was shattered. Scarcity can give workers power, but scarcity is temporary: Eventually, enough people train to work in your industry, or your boss figures out how to outsource your job to overseas workers with fewer protections and rights, and your power is shattered. No wonder tech bosses are so excited about AI coding tools, which promise to turn skilled programmers from creative problem-solvers to mere code reviewers for AI as it produces tech debt at scale. Code reviewers never tell their bosses to go to hell, and they are a lot easier to replace. Now that tech workers are as disposable as Amazon warehouse workers and drivers, as disposable as the factory workers in iPhone City, it’s only a matter of time until the job conditions are harmonized downward. Jeff Bezos doesn’t force his delivery drivers to relieve themselves in bottles because he hates delivery drivers. Jeff Bezos doesn’t allow his coders to use a restroom whenever they need to because he loves hackers. The factor that determines how Jeff Bezos treats workers is “What is the worst treatment those workers can be forced to accept?” Throughout the entire history of human civilization, there has only ever been one way to guarantee fair wages and decent conditions for workers: unions. Even non-union workers benefit from unions, because strong unions are the force that causes labor protection laws to be passed, which protect all workers. Tech workers have historically been monumentally uninterested in unionization, and it’s not hard to see why. Why go to all those meetings and pay those dues when you could tell your boss to go to hell on Tuesday and have a new job by Wednesday? That’s not the case anymore. It will likely never be the case again. Interest in tech unions is at an all-time high. Groups such as Tech Solidarity and the Tech Workers Coalition are doing a land-office business, and copies of Ethan Marcotte’s You Deserve a Tech Union are flying off the shelves. Now is the time to get organized. Your boss has made it clear how you’d be treated if they had their way. They’re about to get it. Walking a picket line is a slog, to be sure, but picket lines beat piss bottles, hands down.

Title: Abu Dhabi Fund MGX Emerges As Key Player In Two Major Trump-Era Deals
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacheverson/2025/10/15/mgx-abu-dhabi-tiktok-trump-usd1-binance-aligned-data-centers/
Time Published: 2025-10-15T17:24:27Z

ByZach Everson, Forbes Staff. MGX, a state-backed Abu Dhabi fund, has surfaced in two of the most scrutinized deals in Donald Trump’s second term—it’s reportedly set to take a stake in TikTok’s U.S. business and used a Trump-linked stablecoin for a $2 billion transaction that may have benefited the president’s family financially. The Abu Dhabi government created MGX in March 2024 as a technology investment company, tasked with “accelerat[ing] the development and adoption of AI and advanced technologies” through global partnerships, according to a launch announcement. MGX was launched by Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, and G42, an artificial intelligence holding company, in which Microsoft has invested $1.5 billion. The fund targets semiconductors, infrastructure, software, tech-enabled services, life sciences and automation services, with past investments in OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Databricks, Altera and Binance. Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan chairs MGX’s board—he’s also the deputy ruler of Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates’ National Security Adviser and chair of G42’s board as well as those of four other companies. MGX’s CEO, Ahmed Yahia Al Idrissi, studied at MIT, worked in investment banking and previously oversaw private equity investments at Mubadala. Asked about the TikTok talks, MGX chief communications officer Noelle Camilleri told Forbes, “On TikTok, we don’t have anything to share at this time.” In April 2024, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan bill banning TikTok in the United States over privacy and data concerns, effective January 2025. The ban was never enforced, and on Sept. 25, Trump signed an executive order, “Saving TikTok While Protecting National Security,” that would allow the platform to remain available. The executive order paves the way for U.S. investors to take majority control, while the Chinese parent company ByteDance’s stake will drop to less than 20%. The new owners have not been confirmed but, citing unnamed sources, CNBC reported that MGX, Oracle and private-equity firm Silver Lake will be the main investors, owning a combined 45% of TikTok USA. Oracle and Silver Lake did not respond to inquiries. On Wednesday, MGX announced it was teaming with the Artificial Infrastructure Partnership and BlackRock to buy Aligned Data Centers in a deal that values the company, which has 50 facilities, at $40 billion. The TikTok deal is not the first time MGX has been tied to Trump’s administration. The day after his second inauguration, Trump announced Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative backed by MGX, OpenAI, Oracle and Japan’s SoftBank. And earlier in September, MGX joined Silver Lake in buying a 51% stake in Altera, Intel’s programmable-chip unit. The U.S. government owns 9.9% of Intel, after taking the extraordinary step of purchasing an $8.9 billion stake as part of the Trump administration’s semiconductor strategy. Final terms of the TikTok restructuring are not publicly known, including how large a stake MGX may take and what governance rights it could secure. Another open question is whether MGX will use the Trump-linked USD1 in future deals. $100 billion: The amount MGX hopes to have under management within a few years, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. World Liberty Financial says it was “inspired by the vision of Donald J. Trump” and lists him as co-founder emeritus, alongside co-founders Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Barron Trump. According to the company’s website, an LLC affiliated with the Trump family owns about 38% of World Liberty Financial, which issues the USD1 stablecoin. Stablecoin issuers typically earn interest on the reserves backing their tokens, such as U.S. Treasurys and cash equivalents. In May, World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff said MGX would use $2 billion worth of USD1 to invest in the crypto exchange Binance. That choice effectively placed $2 billion of reserves with USD1’s custodian, potentially increasing the interest income for World Liberty Financial’s owners. The transaction also helped lift USD1’s market cap, aiding its scale and visibility. As of 1 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, USD1’s $2.7 billion market cap made it the sixth-largest stablecoin, according to CoinGecko, a crypto analytics firm. Also, two weeks after Witkoff announced the deal, the Trump administration agreed to allow the UAE to buy advanced computer chips from U.S. companies, the New York Times reported. One company set to benefit from the deal: G42, a founding partner of MGX, which Tahnoon chairs. (Although that deal is delayed, with some administration officials concerned about G42’s involvement, the Wall Street Journal recently reported. G42 did not respond to Forbes’ inquiry.) An MGX spokesperson told Forbes that Binance asked to settle in cryptocurrency and both sides opted for a stablecoin to limit volatility. Binance’s said that while its client “did not control the payment method chosen by MGX,” it welcomed the use of a stablecoin. MGX said it evaluated stablecoins on business suitability, the jurisdiction and currency of the reserves, and compliance history, then chose USD1 because it is fully reserved in U.S. dollar-denominated assets held by an independent U.S. custodian and audited. MGX added that it did not invest in World Liberty Financial, paid no fees and doesn’t hold USD1 today. MGX said it weighed “compliance history” in picking USD1, but that claim doesn’t match the timeline: MGX announced its $2 billion Binance investment on March 12, and World Liberty Financial didn’t unveil USD1 until March 25—leaving little track record to assess. Another firm Tahnoon chairs, G42, already had owned a stake in ByteDance but divested it after in response to U.S. lawmakers concerns about his ties to China. In January 2024, a Republican-led House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party urged the Commerce Department to impose export controls on G42—an AI holding company that helped found MGX—after an investigation found G42 had ties to Huawei and other blacklisted Chinese companies. The probe also linked G42 affiliates to a scientist accused of stealing U.S. military-funded research from UCLA to establish a government lab in Beijing. The following month, G42 divested from Chinese companies—including what had been a $100 million stake in ByteDance, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the deal. In April, Microsoft announced its $1.5 billion investment in G42 and a partnership to accelerate AI in the UAE. After MGX’s use of USD1 became public, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., joined by 11 other Democrats and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., filed a resolution to enforce the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause, which bars presidents from “accept[ing] of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State” without Congress’ consent. Senate Republicans blocked the measure. Separately, Sens. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote to Binance and MGX, asking why they used USD1 instead of fiat or another cryptocurrency. Any responses have not been made public, and Binance’s attorney declined to share details on any response it sent beyond saying its client “conducted themselves entirely properly with regard to the MGX investment.” The senators also asked the Office of Government Ethics to weigh in, but it has not responded. “You probably don’t have to scratch very deep to find an instance where the president has received an enormous infusion of cash to his crypto coin from a CEO or foreign oligarch who is then asking for a favor from Donald Trump,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told MSNBC in May. Since 2008, MGX vice chair Khaldoon Al Mubarak also has chaired Manchester City Football Club. Forbes ranks the team no. 5 on its list of the world’s most valuable sports franchises, estimating it’s worth $5.3 billion.

Title: BlackRock-led Consortium Buys Aligned Data Centers for $40B

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy The AI revolution is expensive, but a group of investors led by BlackRock aren’t shy to open their wallets. The Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), founded late last year by BlackRock, NVIDIA, Microsoft and MGX, bought Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion. The deal, which also included BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), is aimed at funding next-generation cloud and AI computing infrastructure. Australia-based Macquarie Asset Management sold the equity. Founded in 2013, Aligned has emerged as a leader in the data center space with more than 5 gigawatts of current and planned capacity across 50 global campuses. Aligned’s portfolio is found across Northern Virginia (which include two hyperscale campuses in Sterling and Ashburn), Chicago, Dallas, Salt Lake City, Phoenix, Ohio, São Paulo, Brazil, Queretaro, Mexico and Santiago, Chile. The consortium — financially anchored by the Kuwait Investment Authority and Singapore’s state-owned Temasek Holdings — plans to accelerate that growth, though expansion details were not disclosed. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026. Aligned will stay headquartered in Dallas with CEO Andrew Schapp at the helm. “AI is reshaping every sector of the global economy,” Bayo Ogunlesi, GIP chairman and CEO, said in a statement. “By combining Aligned’s scalable, adaptable platform with AIP’s capital and capabilities, we will build the infrastructure to support innovation at scale.” Aligned’s trajectory is emblematic of the sheer energy surrounding data center investment. The company earlier this year raised roughly $12 billion in capital, split between equity and debt, in one of the largest-ever private sector investments in a data center developer. Indeed, tech companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others are expected to spend some $400 billion on AI infrastructure this year alone, according to Morgan Stanley.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off: IBIT ETF Breaks $100 Billion Barrier

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to statements made on CNBC, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has topped $100 billion in assets under management less than two years after it launched. That figure marks one of the fastest rises for any ETF in recent memory. It also puts the world’s largest asset manager squarely at the center of institutional Bitcoin holdings. Based on reports, BlackRock holds 804,944 BTC. At current, lower market levels, that stash is worth close to $90 billion. When Bitcoin hit an all-time high last week, the same holding was worth more than $100 billion. BlackRock’s position represents 3.83% of Bitcoin’s total supply. For comparison, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) owns 640,250 BTC, or 3.048% of supply, according to available figures. Those numbers show how ownership of Bitcoin is shifting toward big financial firms as ETFs and other products bring new capital into crypto markets. Larry Fink told viewers the firm is moving faster into digital assets and that tokenization will be used for a wide range of investments, from property to bonds. BlackRock also manages an Ethereum portfolio valued at more than $17 billion. The company has launched tokenized money market vehicles, and one product called BUIDL has become the largest tokenized cash money market fund, according to the firm. With about $4 trillion reportedly sitting in digital wallets worldwide, BlackRock sees an opportunity to reach investors who prefer digital channels. Reports show IBIT’s rapid growth has changed the balance of large holders. Where corporate treasuries and early adopters once dominated ownership, institutional funds now control a rising share. That matters for liquidity and for how large inflows or outflows might affect the market when they happen. It also shifts some power over market behavior to managers who must answer to clients and regulators. Based on market updates, Bitcoin fell below $112,500 on Wednesday. Price action cooled after recent gains, with renewed headwinds including US-China trade tensions and a temporary US government shutdown contributing to weaker sentiment. Analysts say the next few weeks could offer buying chances as funding and perpetual markets calm. Institutional flows into ETFs like IBIT will be watched closely because they can tilt short-term demand. BlackRock’s move signals a larger reality: digital assets are now part of mainstream finance. Fink’s change in tone — from caution to active investment — reflects that shift. The presence of a major manager with hundreds of thousands of BTC and a growing set of tokenized offerings will influence how investors view crypto exposure.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: BlackRock’s $40 billion deal highlights the unstoppable AI data center gold rush, as CEO Larry Fink pushes back on AI bubble fears

Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Today’s announcement that a group of investors led by BlackRock has agreed to buy Aligned Data Centers in a $40 billion deal underscores the seemingly unstoppable flow of money into AI data centers—and comes as its CEO, Larry Fink, pushes back on AI bubble fears. The deal to buy Aligned, which is owned by Macquarie Asset Management, is being inked by the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP)—a coalition formed in September 2024 by BlackRock, its infrastructure arm, Global Infrastructure Partners, as well as Microsoft, Nvidia, and MGX, an AI investment firm backed by Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala. The Kuwait Investment Authority, xAI, and Temasek joined as additional participants. The AIP was formed to invest up to $30 billion of equity capital in AI, data centers, and energy; this is its first deal, which ranks as one of BlackRock’s largest infrastructure investments to date. If completed, it would be among the largest data center transactions on record, and regardless it underscores how Wall Street is racing to claim a stake in the AI boom. Fink has rejected the idea that AI infrastructure spending represents a dangerous bubble, arguing that massive data center build-outs are essential if the U.S. is to remain the global leader. “Well, there’s a bubble in investing,” he said on CNBC Squawk Box yesterday. “But are we inferring a bubble means a bad thing? There is certainly a skyrocketing amount of capital being put to work. If you put it in a framework of geopolitical positioning, we as a country need these investments if we’re going to be the leader in AI technology.” Aligned Data Centers, which is based in Plano, Texas, was founded in 2013 to build and operate data centers for hyperscalers and cloud-computing companies. It has data centers across the U.S.—including in Northern Virginia, Chicago, Dallas, Ohio, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City—as well as in Mexico, Brazil, and Chile. The timing of the deal comes as Big Tech firms race to secure scarce land, power, and compute capacity—the foundational resources underpinning the AI race. For example, over the past few weeks, OpenAI has announced multibillion-dollar deals with Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD in order to lock in the computing power the company needs. “We cannot fall behind in the need to put the infrastructure together to make this revolution happen,” Altman told reporters during a media event at OpenAI and Oracle’s flagship 800-acre Stargate data center location in Abilene, Texas, last month, where he also announced the companies will build five massive new data center complexes across the U.S. over the next several years. OpenAI is far from alone: Microsoft has made several multibillion-dollar deals in the past two months with U.K.-based data center developer Nscale, including the announcement today of a new site in Texas that will have capacity of as much as 240 megawatts of power. Also today, Meta announced it would invest $1.5 billion in an AI data center in El Paso, Texas, that could scale to 1 gigawatt, making it one of the largest planned data center campuses in the U.S. The total numbers are staggering: On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade. And McKinsey said U.S. data center demand, driven largely by AI, could triple by 2030, and require data centers to make nearly $7 trillion in investments to keep up. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The long list of proposed funds includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP ETFs, as well as funds giving amplified exposure to crypto-related stocks such as crypto exchange Coinbase and Bitcoin treasury firms Strategy and Tesla. Typical ETFs give investors exposure to an asset—be it a security or commodity—via shares that track its price and trade on stock exchanges. A leveraged ETF holds debt to amplify its position. The idea is that returns for investors can be greater than the tracked asset, but losses can also be compounded—in this case, potentially by five times. Volatility Shares had already filed the paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission to get crypto ETFs on the market with three times exposure to the daily returns of the asset. The company in March debuted two ETFs tracking Solana futures, including one with two times daily exposure to SOL. Leveraged crypto ETFs are already on the market: Miami, Florida-based Defiance ETF's MSTX gives investors access to a leveraged position in Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy's stock (MSTR), amplifying gains—and losses—by 175%.

A group including BlackRock, Nvidia and Microsoft is buying Aligned Data Centers in an approximately $40 billion deal in an effort to expand next-generation cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure. The acquisition comes amid a flurry of deals in recent months involving top AI developers that are flooding the booming AI sector with resources and money, and addressing resources -- such as electricity and infrastructure -- needed to support such technology. Last week it was revealed that semiconductor maker AMD will supply its chips to artificial intelligence company OpenAI as part of an agreement to team up on building AI infrastructure. OpenAI will also get the option to buy as much as a 10% stake in AMD, according to a joint statement announcing the deal. Last month, OpenAI and Nvidia announced a $100 billion partnership that will add at least 10 gigawatts of data center computing power. Aligned’s portfolio includes 50 campuses and more than 5 gigawatts of operational and planned capacity, including assets under development, mostly located across the U.S. and in Latin America. Some locations include northern Virginia; Chicago; Dallas; Ohio; Phoenix; Salt Lake City; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Queretaro, Mexico; and Santiago, Chile. Aligned, which is privately held, will continue to be led by CEO Andrew Schaap and keep its headquarters in Dallas. One of the sellers, Macquarie Asset Management, initially invested in Aligned in 2018. Ben Way, head of Macquarie Asset Management, said in a statement, “The scaling of Aligned Data Centers from two locations to 50 in seven years is representative of our approach to working with great companies and teams to support their rapid growth and deliver positive impact.” The transaction is the first deal for the investment consortium, which is named the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership. The consortium has an initial target of mobilizing and deploying $30 billion of equity capital, with the potential of reaching $100 billion including debt. “AIP is positioned to meet the growing demand for the infrastructure required as AI continues to reshape the global economy," BlackRock Chairman and CEO and AIP Chairman Larry Fink said in a statement. “This partnership is bringing together leading companies and mobilizing private capital to accelerate AI innovation and drive global economic growth and productivity.” The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026. Shares of Nvidia rose about 1% in morning trading. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

AI darling Nvidia just struck another big data center deal—this time as part of a group with Microsoft, BlackRock, and others. A consortium including BlackRock (BLK), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) said Wednesday it would buy AI data center infrastructure company Aligned Data Centers in an agreement valued at $40 billion. Aligned Data Centers is one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing data center firms, and the group said the purchase “will fuel the expansion of next-generation cloud and AI infrastructure.” The massive deal could be taken as another strong signal of AI demand expectations, with Nvidia, Microsoft, and BlackRock making big bets on AI-driven growth. The deal marks the latest in a string of high-profile agreements and partnerships for AI chip leader Nvidia, and infrastructure deals for BlackRock, which has been eying energy providers as another way to ride the AI boom. BlackRock CEO and AIP Chair Larry Fink said that with the acquisition, “we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI, while offering our clients attractive opportunities to participate in its growth.” Shares of Nvidia and Microsoft pared back early gains and were down about 1% in recent trading. Shares of BlackRock were less than 1% lower. This article has been updated since it was first published for clarity and to reflect more recent stock price values.

Title: Khosla Ventures And Cleveland Clinic Partner On Healthcare Tech
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/innovationrx/2025/10/15/khosla-ventures-and-cleveland-clinic-partner-on-healthcare-tech/
Time Published: 2025-10-15T16:00:22Z

ByAmy Feldman, Forbes Staff andAlex Knapp, Forbes Staff. In this week’s edition of InnovationRx, we look at the Khosla Ventures-Cleveland Clinic partnership, Town Hall Ventures’ $440 million haul, the CDC’s “Friday night massacre,” Boehringer’s new pulmonary fibrosis drug, and more. To get it in your inbox, subscribe here. New technologies are transforming the way that hospitals operate. To try and gain an edge, Khosla Ventures and Cleveland Clinic signed a deal in which the health system will test new technologies that span AI, digital health and next-generation therapeutics from the VC firm’s portfolio companies—and the two will explore opportunities to incubate new companies together. “I think this is a novel approach,” Hal Paz, Khosla Ventures’ operating partner, told Forbes. Discussions that led to the agreement, announced at Cleveland Clinic’s Life Sciences Summit in London on Tuesday, had been in the works for a year. The storied VC firm, with $17 billion in assets under management and more than 300 portfolio companies (about one-third of them in healthcare), gains a substantial healthcare partner with whom to test new technologies from clinical validation through adoption, that may also become a valuable customer for the companies it’s invested in. Meanwhile, Cleveland Clinic, the highly-regarded non-profit health system that spans 23 hospitals and 280 outpatient facilities, gets access to a pipeline of emerging technologies that could help it improve care and efficiency. Already, some 10 to 12 of Khosla’s portfolio companies, mostly in AI and digital health, are in discussions with Cleveland Clinic about how they could work with the health system, Paz said. One, Vista AI, which has developed AI to automate and simplify cardiac MRIs, is already working with Cleveland Clinic at its Akron hospital. Vista’s software enables more scans to be done on a single machine with improved quality and consistency. The two are also already working on a first startup incubation, though neither the final idea nor the timing of its launch has been set. “We are at an inflection point in the industry,” said JD Friedland, Cleveland Clinic’s executive director of venture. “New transformational technologies are emerging that we believe are going to fundamentally address some of the perpetual challenges in healthcare.” The agreement comes as tech-based venture firms have increasingly viewed healthcare as an area of opportunity and as hospitals and health systems have been testing how technology could improve patient care, reduce physician burnout and increase razor-thin margins. It also follows a move by General Catalyst to acquire health system Summa Health, a $515 million deal that created the first hospital system to be owned by a VC firm. “I bet the more significant venture investors in healthcare are going to find different ways to get access to that clinical and research expertise,” Cleveland Clinic’s Friedland said. “It certainly costs a lot less money to partner with Cleveland Clinic than to buy a hospital, and it comes with less strings attached and less brain damage.” For both Khosla and Cleveland Clinic, their non-exclusive partnership could be the first of multiple collaborations—but both Paz and Friedland stressed there was much to do first. Said Paz: “Before we get over our skis and think about the second health system to partner with and the third, we need to give this a little time and learn from it.” When Andy Slavitt left government, he wanted to prove that you could use technology to improve healthcare for underserved and low-income communities—and still make a profit. The former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and overseer of the successful turnaround of healthcare.gov, set up healthcare-focused VC firm Town Hall Ventures in the summer of 2018 to do just that. “I’ve got a little bit of a chip on my shoulder,” he told Forbes. “If [investors] think you are impact, they’ll put you in this bucket—people who do nice things and maybe some nice family office wants to invest in you because they’ve got an impact mandate. I have always resisted that.” Since its launch seven years ago, Town Hall Ventures has invested in 35 companies and started seven others, including kidney care specialist Strive and Suvida, which offers primary care focused on Hispanic seniors and their families. Its first fund posted top-decile performance, with a net internal rate of return from its July 2018 inception (thru June 30) of 33% versus 12% for the median VC fund. A total of 10 its bets surpassed a billion-dollar valuation, including Cityblock Health, a healthcare provider focused on low-income communities that was one of its initial investments and has since reached a valuation of $6.2 billion; SignifyHealth, a provider of tech-enabled at-home risk assessment acquired by CVS for $8 billion in 2023; and Landmark Health, a startup offering in-home medical care to patients with chronic conditions purchased by Optum Health for $3.5 billion in 2021. Buoyed by that track record, Town Hall Ventures told Forbes it has now raised $440 million for a fourth fund, bringing its total assets under management to $1.4 billion. While the New York-based firm, whose general partners consist of Slavitt, David Whelan and Meera Mani, remains small compared to venture capital giants like Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst or Sequoia, each of which has tens of billions in assets under management, it’s a well-regarded player in healthcare.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive disease in which scarring on the lungs makes it increasingly difficult to breathe. Martin Beck, head of Boehringer’s inflammation disease area, told trade publication Fierce Pharma that the drug represented a major shift forward in treating a disease that had been a “graveyard of clinical development” with more than 36 failed trials over the past decade. Jascayd blocks a type of enzyme, called PDE4B, that’s involved in the honeycomb-patterned lung scarring and inflammation associated with the disease. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that it slowed patients’ decline in lung function compared to a placebo over the course of a year. Plus: Obesity startup Kailera Therapeutics raised $600 million, led by Bain Capital Private Equity, to start Phase III trials of its lead drug candidate, an injectable GLP-1 drug similar to Lilly’s Zepbound. The size of the round ties it with Isomorphic Labs for the largest biotech fundraise of the year. Forbes profiled Kailera earlier this year. Kailera was worth $1.5 billion before the new funding; its new valuation was not disclosed. Duos, a digital health company focused on seniors, raised $130 million, led by FTV Capital, at an undisclosed valuation. The two-year-old company helps members enroll in government programs, retain Medicaid coverage and figure out benefits they may be eligible for but aren’t using. Plus: Umar Afridi, a pharmacist who previously cofounded Truepill, raised $20 million to bring AI to pharmacy operations with Foundation Health. Truepill was acquired by LetsGetChecked for $525 million last year. Digital Health-focused VC firm Define Ventures led the funding round. Biotech startup Immusoft safely re-dosed a patient with its experimental gene therapy for progressive genetic disorder called mucopolysaccharidosis type I that causes skeletal abnormalities, heart disease and vision loss. The company’s gene therapy makes use of engineered B-cells, which the body typically uses to make antibodies, to make specific proteins that treat diseases instead. The benefit of the approach is that it doesn’t require immunosuppression or chemotherapy as other gene therapies do. The ability to safely re-dose makes the therapy more long-lasting, which had been a question during its clinical trial. Forbes spoke with CEO Sean Ainsworth about the company’s technology earlier this year. Plus: Johnson & Johnson is spinning off its orthopedics business, which generated $9.2 billion in revenue in 2024. The new company, called DePuy Synthes, is expected to launch in 2027. Last Friday, around 1,300 CDC employees received notices that they’d been laid off with no warning. Over the weekend, more than half appear to have been told their firing was rescinded, though some 600 employees still appear to remain fired, according to the National Public Health Coalition, an organization of former CDC employees. So far, many of the departments hit appear to be core to the agency’s work, including the CDC library, which provides access to crucial scientific data for agency scientists; the agency’s entire Washington office, which provides information and support to Congress, the Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and staff focused on data collection and disease surveillance. The Health and Human Services Department blamed the layoffs on the current government shutdown and said that employees laid off had been declared non-essential. This is one of several waves of layoffs that have eliminated around 25% of the CDC’s staff since Trump took office. The American Federation of Government Employees has sued the Trump Administration, challenging the legality of layoffs during a government shutdown. In a lawsuit over a previous round of layoffs, a federal judge found that the Administration’s firing of CDC staff was likely unlawful. “Many experts, including myself, are concerned that we are no longer prepared for the next big outbreak or disaster because of the Trump Administration’s continued erosion of our nation’s ability to respond to public health emergencies,” John Brooks, former chief medical officer for CDC’s Division of HIV Prevention, told reporters at an National Public Health Coalition press conference on Tuesday. In response these ongoing program cuts, the Wall Street Journal reported today that 15 states, all with Democratic governors, are building an alliance to manage public health threats. The states have agreed that they will “help one another prepare for pandemics, track infectious diseases, write public-health guidelines, share expertise on preventive care and buy vaccines and supplies in bulk.” Novo Nordisk agreed to acquire Akero Therapeutics for up to $5.2 billion for its experimental liver disease treatment. San Francisco-based Akero has been testing its drug, efruxifermin, as a treatment for MASH, which causes fat to build up on the liver, leading to fibrosis. The deal follows Roche’s announcement last month that it was buying 89bio for $3.5 billion for its experimental MASH drug. Amazon sellers made millions from banned “Dechoker” medical devices, according to the FDA. Biotech dealmaking, from M&A to venture investments, ticked up in the third quarter. Political pressures are influencing work at FDA, according to career staffers there. Consumer Reports found that some protein shakes and powders contain extremely high levels of lead. Mixtures of common drugs that wind up in waterways may accelerate the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria, according to research led by the University of Exeter. Wearable health company Oura raised $900 million led by Fidelity, bringing its valuation to $11 billion. That’s more than double the $5.2 billion it was worth last December. The United Nations World Food Programme warned that nearly 14 million people faced severe hunger due to cuts in global aid, especially from the Trump Administration.

Title: What Chipmaking Equipment Giant ASML's Q3 Results Said About AI Demand, China Trade

Chipmaking equipment supplier ASML says it's upbeat on AI demand, even in the face trade policy headwinds. The Netherlands-based firm said it doesn't see its 2026 sales falling from 2025 levels even though it expects sales in China to “decline significantly,” thanks in part to strong demand for its machines to make chips supporting AI data centers. CEO Christophe Fouquet said the company has seen “continued positive momentum around investments in AI, and (has) also seen this extending to more customers.” U.S.-listed shares of ASML (ASML) were up about 3% in recent trading. Shares of other companies in the semiconductor industry, including Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Lam Research (LRCX), also gained after a down day for the sector yesterday. As one of the world’s leading suppliers of chipmaking equipment, ASML's results can be taken as a signal of whether chipmakers are feeling confident in the future of their businesses. ASML reported third-quarter earnings per share of 5.49 euros ($6.38), above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, though its revenue of 7.52 billion euros ($8.74 billion) missed. Fouquet said ASML sees current-quarter sales of between 9.2 billion and 9.8 billion euros ($10.7 billion and $11.4 billion), above the analyst consensus, and that the company plans to provide more details on its 2026 outlook in January. With Wednesday's gains, ASML shares have added 46% in 2025 so far.

Amazon is reportedly planning significant layoffs, targeting about 15% of its human resources staff and potentially impacting other departments. This move aligns with the tech giant's strategy to invest heavily in artificial intelligence while reducing employee costs. CEO Andy Jassy has previously indicated that AI adoption will lead to workforce reductions as the company seeks efficiency gains.

Title: The Protocol: Monad Airdrop Portal Opens as Token Launch Nears

This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk. In this issue: MONAD AIRDROP COMES CLOSER AS PORTAL OPENS: Monad is gearing up for one of the most anticipated token launches of the year. The Layer-1 blockchain project has opened its MON airdrop portal, inviting eligible users to check their status ahead of the official token distribution. While the airdrop itself hasn’t gone live yet, the Monad Foundation said that users can now verify eligibility and connect their wallets, with the window remaining open until Nov. 3, 2025. “There is NO incentive to claiming really fast, so take your time. Triple check everything,” said Keone Hon, the co-founder of Monad, on X. The Monad Foundation shared in a blog post that it will target around 5,500 core community members and 225,000 broader crypto users, rewarding those who’ve helped grow the Monad ecosystem. Distribution will be done through a multi-track system spanning five categories: Monad Community, Onchain Users, Crypto Community, Crypto Contributors & Curious and Monad Builders. Those who qualify across multiple tracks can stack their allocations, giving more weight to active participants. The team also said it will be combining on-chain activity data (such as DEX volume and NFT ownership) with off-chain verification through platforms like Twitter, Discord and Telegram. The airdrop marks a step toward Monad’s upcoming mainnet launch, though the details of when that will happen and the number of tokens allocated towards these communities are still unknown. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. FUSAKA GOES LIVE ON ETHEREUM’S SEPOLIA TESTNET: Ethereum developers launched the second test of the upcoming Fusaka upgrade earlier this week on the Sepolia network, marking another step toward the upgrade’s mainnet debut. The test follows a successful rollout on the Holesky testnet two weeks ago. Developers plan one final rehearsal on the Hoodi network on Oct. 28, after which they’ll set a date to activate Fusaka on Ethereum’s main blockchain. Coming only a few months after Ethereum’s major Pectra upgrade, Fusaka is designed to lower costs for institutions using the network. One of its key features, PeerDAS, allows validators to verify only portions of data rather than entire “blobs.” This improvement reduces bandwidth demands and helps cut costs for both layer-2 networks and validators. Testnets like Sepolia play a crucial role in Ethereum’s development cycle, giving developers a reliable environment to test upgrades under real-world conditions before they go live on the main network. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. MONERO RELEASES PRIVACY BOOST AGAINST SNEAKY NETWORK NODES: Leading privacy blockchain Monero has released an important upgrade that significantly strengthens user protection against spy nodes. The blockchain announced CLI v0.18.4.3 'Fluorine Fermi' on X, calling it a highly recommended release that enhances protection against spy nodes. Monero relies on a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network where nodes (computers) connect directly to each other to share and verify transactions and blocks. Privacy is ensured through several key technologies: each transaction uses unique stealth addresses so that the recipient’s actual address stays hidden; ring signatures mix a sender’s transaction with other decoy transactions, making it unclear who really sent the funds; and Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) hide the amount being transferred. Still, a paper published on the research sharing platform arXiv in September noted the growing presence of non-standard nodes in the network. These nodes pose as honest nodes but are likely intended for monitoring the network and spying on other nodes, thereby endangering privacy. The Fluorine Fermi update tackles this challenge by implementing an improved peer selection algorithm that reduces the chance users connect to multiple nodes within the same IP subnet, a common spy node tactic. It discourages connections to large clusters of suspicious IP addresses, steering users toward safer nodes. — Omkar Godbole Read more. EF MAKES PRIVACY A PILLAR OF ITS WORK: The Ethereum Foundation is making privacy a formal pillar of its roadmap, expanding research efforts into a dedicated cluster that now covers private payments, proofs, identity, and enterprise use cases. Ethereum has supported privacy research through its Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) team since 2018, with experiments like Semaphore for anonymous signaling, MACI for private voting, zkEmail and zkTLS, and the Anon Aadhaar project. These have become reference points for developers across the ecosystem, spawning hundreds of forks and integrations. The new “privacy cluster,” coordinated by Igor Barinov, brings these experiments under a single umbrella alongside new initiatives, per a blog post. Those include private reads and writes for payments and interactions, portable proofs for identity and asset ownership, zkID systems for selective disclosure, UX work to normalize privacy tools, and Kohaku, an SDK and wallet designed to make strong cryptography usable by default. An Institutional Privacy Task Force is also part of the cluster, translating compliance and operational requirements into specifications that larger enterprises can test. The Foundation framed privacy as essential to Ethereum’s credibility. Blockchains are transparent by design, but widespread adoption requires that users and institutions have the option to transact, govern, and build without exposing sensitive data. – Shaurya Malwa Read more.

U.S. stock market rallied sharply Wednesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 351 points (0.8%), while the S&P 500 gained 1%, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.2%. Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) led the rally after posting far stronger-than-expected quarterly results. Other financial heavyweights, including Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and PNC Financial, also delivered positive surprises. Despite today’s optimism, trade concerns remain a market overhang.

U.S. stock market rallied sharply Wednesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 351 points (0.8%), while the S&P 500 gained 1%, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.2%. Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) led the rally after posting far stronger-than-expected quarterly results. Other financial heavyweights, including Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and PNC Financial, also delivered positive surprises. Despite today’s optimism, trade concerns remain a market overhang.

"Five years from now, there's not going to be a stock, there's not going to be an option, there's not going to be a mutual fund, ETF, anything that's not in effect tokenized," Moglia told CNBC on Tuesday, describing traditional finance professionals as still struggling to grasp the shift happening in Web3 and DeFi markets. “Going forward, real-world assets are going to be tokenized as the rest of the world is going to be,” he added, while adding he’s pursuing tokenization of its reinsurance company's risk as part of its strategy. His comments come as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink appeared on 60 Minutes advocating crypto ownership after previously dismissing Bitcoin in 2017 as an "index of money laundering,” a shift Moglia attributes to Fink becoming "a DeFi guy" who "appreciates the future." BlackRock is developing proprietary tokenization technology and "having conversations with all the major platforms" about digital wallet integration, according to Fink's recent earnings call. "We need to be tokenizing all assets, especially assets that have multiple levels of intermediaries," Fink said, pointing to real estate, where tokenization could reduce fees and make home ownership more affordable by cutting out layers of middlemen. Fabian Dori, Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum, told Decrypt that tokenization will now "work its way up that risk curve" toward less liquid assets. "I truly believe ultimately we will have almost every financial asset in a tokenized version because it just helps to automate the value chain, starting from issuance over the primary market, secondary market, the legal anchor, corporate actions, all of this. Musheer Ahmed, Founder & MD of Finstep Asia, told Decrypt, "while there is significant momentum for tokenization of financial products and I am also bullish on the use case, this timeline of 5 years to tokenize everything is highly optimistic." Ahmed noted that the timeline is plausible even as “most trading rails and infra will take many years” and that “the tokenization wave is led by the US, Hong Kong, Singapore, and UAE,” while most markets still “lack frameworks for digital assets.” The low trading volume in tokenized assets stems from “the nature of the underlying assets,” he said, noting “most RWAs are not liquid or in high demand for daily turnover.” “Current tokenized products (outside of bonds) are not being actively marketed by brokers, private banks, or investment funds,” he said, and that once they are offered more widely, “demand will pick up and help create a more dynamic secondary market.” Total real-world assets on-chain have reached $33.91 billion, up 6.6% from 30 days ago, with 483,892 total asset holders, according to RWA.xyz data.

Title: AI Won’t Replace Jobs, but Tech Bros Want You to Be Afraid It Will

reading time 5 minutes AI is overrated, according to author Cory Doctorow. “I don’t think AI can do your job,” Doctorow said, but despite that, bosses across industries are “insatiably horny” about the idea that AI will replace jobs. Top of the list is tech bosses. Tech is one of the industries where AI is scaling significantly faster in the workforce than average (the bigger picture corporate AI adoption is much slower, and some studies claim the returns on investments are low). Many tech CEOs have made statements expressing their wishes to automate tasks that would have regularly gone to human workers. A new report by Source, a consulting firm that works with the tech industry, claimed that over half of tech companies are considering restructuring because of AI. “Tech bosses love the story of AI replacing programmers,” Doctorow said at an event hosted by the Brooklyn Public Library last week, where he was answering former FTC chair Lina Khan’s questions. During her tenure in the Biden administration, Khan was known for her firm regulatory stance against big tech monopolies. Computer programming was once the most lucrative industry to go into, with a surplus of demand for workers; there were numerous job opportunities with great pay and benefits, and cushy amenities. Now, the script has completely switched. Many have blamed the rise of generative AI for it. But Doctorow argues “that’s just not a thing AI is doing” or even can do. “AI can write sub-routines, it can’t do software architecture. Can’t do engineering, because engineering is about having a long, broad context window to understand all the pieces that came before, all the pieces that are coming in the future, and the pieces that sit adjacent to code, and if you know anything about AI, the one thing that is most expensive to do with AI is expanding the context window,” Doctorow said. Doctorow is famous for having coined the term “enshittification” to describe the common, modern-day phenomenon of almost every tech platform becoming soulless, dysfunctional and widely-hated corpses that internet users are still trapped under.Â It’s a cathartically profane critique of capitalism in the tech age that Macquaire Dictionary picked as its word of the year in 2024. He argues that what tech bosses actually like is to have tech workers “terrified that they’re about to be replaced by a chatbot, it gives them a chance to put them in their place.” To understand why, you need to look into how the dynamic has changed in the tech workplace in the past two decades. “The way that tech bosses motivated tech workers was appealing to their sense of mission,” Doctorow said. It was a double-edged sword: it both motivated the tech workers to work grueling hours, but it also made them passionate about the product and its purpose. So, if the boss decided to make changes at the expense of that vision of greater good and in the pursuit of greater margins, the workers tended to fight for the user. One example of that was the Google employee protests over the controversial military AI initiative Project Maven, which successfully saw the tech giant walk back its involvement. Back then, Doctorow argues, tech workers were a good way to keep the industry in check because they had a sense of purpose and they had power. Demand for workers far exceeded the supply, so if things were going awry in the company’s progress towards its mission, they could threaten to leave. There were many other opportunities that they could switch to. But things have since changed, and supply has caught up with demand. Roughly 400,000 tech employees have been laid off in the past two years alone. Silicon Valley companies are asking their employees to work 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week, a schedule known as “996” that was popularized in China. Meanwhile, big tech companies are spending big and making record profits. Nvidia just became the first and only company to hit a $4.5 trillion market cap. The power dynamic has now switched, and the power is with the bosses. And this time around, according to Doctorow, they want to make sure that the power dynamic stays that way. “Tech bosses have shown us how they treat workers they’re not afraid of,” Doctorow said, pointing the finger at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Federal injury data from 2022 found that Amazon warehouse workers were seriously injured at more than twice the rate at other warehouses. A subsequent Senate probe from 2024 concluded that Amazon had been manipulating its self-reported injury data to make its warehouses appear safer. “The minute Jeff Bezos can put a piss jar next to your workstation, he will,” Doctorow said. “At this point, when Google is firing 12,000 workers, and then doing a $70 billion stock buyback that would have paid their wages for the next 27 years, you need a union,” he advised. If Doctorow’s estimates are true, then AI won’t take over any jobs. But then what about the billions and billions of dollars that have been poured into the AI industry, so much so that those investments are almost entirely driving American economic growth? “The great kind of tragedy and terror of all of this is that AI, if it can’t do your job, then whatever benefits we get from it are not commensurate with the capital expenditures that we’ve made for it, nor will they be sufficiently profitable to incur the operational expenses associated with maintaining these large foundation models,” Doctorow said. TLDR on that: He thinks there is an AI bubble. And he is not alone in thinking like this; many other experts have been sounding the alarms of a rapidly growing AI bubble. In a notable addition this week, the United Kingdom’s central bank said that “equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence,” and that this could lead to a sudden, sharp correction. The Bank said that stock market price valuations were comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble, and that the market share of the top five members of the S&P 500 was at its highest concentration in 50 years. Those five are the AI-heavy big tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta. Lina Khan painted a picture of some other reasons why experts believe there is an AI bubble at the event on Thursday. “There have been increasing discussion about how we may actually be just seeing a big AI bubble,” the former FTC chair said. “We’re seeing all of these circular investments where it’s like the same five to seven companies just handing each other big bags of cash, saying, IOU, we’re seeing, you know, increasing reporting in the business press that even though we’re seeing such significant investment in AI, increasingly, firms are being candid that they don’t know what the profitable use case is going to be, but are just kind of afraid of missing out.” In her time in office, Khan’s FTC opened inquiries into the various deals and partnerships between big tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft and the then-rising, now-reigning AI labs OpenAI and Anthropic. A bubble is worrying. A pop is even more worrisome. “I think we’re going to see a collapse, and it’s going to be very bad,” Doctorow said. “I think 2008 is going to look like a golden age when AI pops.” Explore more on these topics Share this story Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

Apple has topped Interbrand’s annual Best Global Brands ranking for the 13th consecutive year—but AI giant Nvidia is closing in on its crown. Interbrand’s list ranks 100 companies based on their financial performance, the role their brand plays in purchase intent, and the brand’s competitive strength. The total value of this year’s Best Global Brands stands at $3.6 trillion, a 4.4% increase versus last year. 2025’s top five brands remained unchanged from 2024, with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Samsung following Apple’s lead. However, further down the list, there’s been a historic surge for Nvidia and 12 new entrants across tech, finance, retail, and more, underlining shifting market dynamics. AI chipmaker Nvidia recorded the largest-ever brand value increase in Best Global Brands’ history, rising by 116% to reach $43.2bn—catapulting it from 36th place in 2024 to 15th in 2025. “Nvidia’s stellar product marketing and complete dominance in its ecosystem have spurred its meteoric rise,” said Greg Silverman, global director of brand economics at Interbrand. However, he cautioned that the Silicon Valley company (which was founded in 1993, but has recently surged in prominence as its hardware drives the AI boom) shouldn’t get too comfortable. “The emergence of a disruptor could undo this brand if it does not invest in long-term brand storytelling,” Silverman said. “It has the scale, but that’s not a brand strategy. To maintain sustainable growth, this is imperative.” Despite their recent advertising blitzes, consumer-facing AI brands like OpenAI and Anthropic did not make this year’s list. Notable new entries included investment firm BlackRock, which landed at number 31, Booking.com (32), and Uniqlo (47). Instagram’s brand value grew 27%, leading it too enter the top 10 for the first time, too. When it came to brand tumbles, Nike—which is transforming to regain its marketing edge—dropped from the 14th to the 23rd spot after losing 26% of its value. Elon Musk’s Tesla also dropped 13 spots to 25th place, with a 35% decline in brand value. Interbrand’s Best Global Brands 2025 – Top 10 1. Apple 2. Microsoft 3. Amazon 4. Google 5. Samsung 6.

Crypto exchange Backpack said it is adding SEC-registered U.S. equities to its trading platform with Superstate, the blockchain finance startup led by Compound founder Robert Leshner. Announced on Wednesday, the deal embeds Superstate’s Opening Bell platform into Backpack, allowing non-U.S. users to trade tokenized shares of public companies onchain. With the addition, Backpack claimed the bragging rights of being the first centralized crypto exchange to list issuer-backed, SEC-registered equities natively onchain. Supported equities and rollout date will be announced in the coming weeks, the firms said. These offerings are not synthetic or wrapped derivative products, the firms said, but real equities issued under U.S. securities law with the same CUSIP identifiers as their traditional counterparts on Nasdaq or the NYSE. "For traders, that means more assets to buy, sell and use as collateral — with better margin opportunities than traditional markets," Robert Leshner said in a statement. "For issuers, it expands reach to millions of crypto-native investors, connecting them directly with modern capital markets infrastructure." The move comes as tokenization of financial instruments, such as equity shares, bonds, and funds, is gaining momentum across crypto markets. A wide range of tokenized equity offerings debuted over the past few months, including Robinhood, Gemini, Ondo Finance's Global Markets and xStocks by Kraken and Backed Finance, creating token versions of the largest publicly-traded companies and ETFs. Superstate's Opening Bell focuses on creating tokenized versions of publicly traded stocks by working through a registered transfer agent. The platform brings the structure of U.S. capital markets onto blockchain rails, offering direct ownership and future access to DeFi tools. Backpack was founded by crypto developer Armani Ferrante and is best known for its role in the Solana ecosystem and having acquired imploded crypto exchange FTX's European arm. It has since grown into a broader financial platform. It launched a centralized exchange in 2023 with a virtual asset service provider license in Dubai, while it opened last month its EU-focused derivatives venue based in Cyprus and regulated under the MiFID II framework.

Bitcoin BTC$108,690.53 mining firm Bitdeer Technologies (BTDR) jumped as much as 30% on Wednesday after announcing new steps to fast-track its expansion into high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. The Singapore-based company said it will directly manage development of its own AI data centers rather than rely on outside partners, starting with its facility in Clarington, Ohio. Bitdeer said the local utility confirmed that all 570 megawatts (MW) of electrical capacity will be available by the end of the third quarter of 2026, nearly a year ahead of schedule. Two other sites — Tydal in Norway and Wenatchee, Washington in the U.S. — will also be converted, with Tydal expected to support 164 MW of AI computing by late next year, the firm said. The company said it sees a "sustained imbalance" between demand and supply of AI computing power. The firm expects to deploy over 200 MW for AI computing by the end of next year. In an optimistic scenario, Bitdeer said its AI operations could generate more than $2 billion in annualized revenue. "This push is driven by a marked increase in inbound interest in our power assets, which has become a strong catalyst for expanding our efforts," Matt Kong, chief business officer at Bitdeer, said in a statement. The company's shares rose as much as 30% in the early minutes in the Wednesday session, trading above $26 for the first time since early January. They were 26% higher at press time. Bitdeer's development fits into a broader trend of crypto mining firms pivoting to repurpose their computing power for the fast-growing AI demand. Miners such as Bitfarms, IREN, TeraWulf have been investor favorites as proxy bets on AI infrastructure and optimism that they would strike lucrative data center hosting deals.

Amazon plans layoffs: Global e-commerce giant Amazon is planning to cut nearly 15% job roles in its human resources department, along with certain other roles, Fortune reported on Wednesday, 15 October 2025. According to the news portal's report, Amazon's HR department, also known as the People eXperience Technology team or PTX, will bear the majority of the cuts, while other departments, such as the consumer business, may also experience some impact. Amazon's HR department has more than 10,000 people employed globally. The company is reportedly laying off staff as the e-commerce giant aims to reduce its employee costs amid heavy investment in artificial intelligence (AI) products and infrastructure. Big IT companies such as TCS, Accenture, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google are among other firms that have carried out restructuring to improve efficiency and reduce costs amid the rise of AI. TCS is cutting nearly 12,000 employees, or around 2% of its global workforce, in the financial year 2025-26, amid restructuring plans and a push for AI expansion. In the case of Wipro, although there is no official confirmation of layoffs, media reports suggest that the IT major has cut 24,516 jobs to improve its cost efficiency and productivity in the sector. Global IT services giant Accenture announced in September 2025 that it would lay off more than 11,000 employees across its global workforce, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has cut 4,000 customer support staff as AI tools take over. Salesforce reportedly reduced its customer support workforce to 5,000 employees, down from its earlier 9,000 employees, marking a reduction of approximately 4,000 employees. 1. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) — Laid off 6,000 employees or 1% of its headcount. It will lay off another 6,000 employees to cut a total of 12,000 jobs or 2% of its total workforce. 2. Google — Laid off 100 employees in design-related roles. 3. Accenture — To lay off 11,000 employees across its global workforce. 4. Salesforce — Cut nearly 4,000 customer support staff. 5. Microsoft — Cut more than 40% or nearly 4,000 jobs in its software engineering business. 6. IBM — Cut nearly 1,000 job roles as the firm shifted to its hybrid cloud and AI business. 7. Cognizant — Laid off 3,500 employees in an effort to simplify the organisation's structure. 8. Wipro — Cut 24,516 jobs to improve its cost efficiency and productivity in the sector. Many tech companies around the world are facing challenges due to pressure from their US business and recent concerns about US President Donald Trump's proposed increase in the H-1B visa fee. Jobs are at risk of being replaced by artificial intelligence, which some companies might prefer to boost productivity and efficiency over that of the human workforce.

Title: How LLY Stock Delivered $47 Billion To Shareholders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/15/how-lly-stock-delivered-47-billion-to-shareholders/
Time Published: 2025-10-15T13:40:48Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In the last decade, Eli Lilly stock (NYSE: LLY) has returned $47 billion to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-centric approach has delivered solid results in 2025, with the stock posting 9% year-to-date returns, despite experiencing some volatility from its peak of $937 earlier in the year, while demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of increased competition in the diabetes and obesity treatment markets. Eli Lilly's commitment to rewarding shareholders reached new heights with the board's approval of a massive $15 billion share repurchase program in December 2024, replacing the completed $5 billion buyback and representing one of the largest capital return initiatives in pharmaceutical industry history. The diabetes and obesity treatment leader further reinforced its shareholder-first philosophy by announcing a 15% dividend increase for the seventh consecutive year, raising the quarterly dividend from $1.30 to $1.50 per share, bringing the annual dividend to $6.00 and yielding approximately 0.74% at current levels. Eli Lilly’s exceptional financial performance has been driven by the blockbuster success of its GLP-1 medications Mounjaro and Zepbound, with 2024 revenues reaching $45.04 billion (up 32% year-over-year) and earnings of $10.59 billion (up 102%), providing the robust cash generation that enables both aggressive share buybacks and consistent dividend growth while maintaining substantial R&D investments for pipeline advancement. These two drugs alone accounted for $11.5 billion in total sales last year, and in the first half of 2025, this figure has surged 115% y-o-y to $14.5 billion. Let’s look at some numbers and compare how this payout power stacks up against the market's biggest capital-return machines. Interestingly, LLY stock ranks 58th in history in total shareholder returns. Why does this matter? Because dividends and buybacks represent direct returns to shareholders and reflect management’s confidence in future cash generation. Many companies follow this strategy. Below is a list of the top 10 companies by total capital returned through dividends and repurchases. While that’s one perspective, Trefis High Quality Portfolio considers many more factors to help reduce company-specific risk while maintaining growth exposure. For the complete list, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking. Key takeaway: Total shareholder returns as a percentage of market cap often appear inversely related to growth potential. Companies like Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding faster and more predictably but have returned smaller proportions of their value to shareholders. That’s the trade-off: attractive capital returns can sometimes come at the cost of growth. Keeping that in mind, let’s examine Eli Lilly’s fundamentals. (See Buy or Sell Eli Lilly Stock for more.) That’s a solid snapshot, but a complete investment evaluation requires a broader view. That’s exactly what the Trefis High Quality Portfolio delivers—balancing lower risk with upside exposure. Still, Lilly isn’t immune to volatility. It dropped 51% during the Global Financial Crisis and 43% in the Dot-Com bubble. Even during more recent events—the 2018 correction, inflation shock, and Covid pandemic—it declined between 18% and 22%. So, while fundamentals remain strong, the stock can still see notable drawdowns during market downturns. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio of 30 stocks has consistently outperformed major benchmarks such as the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000. Why? Collectively, HQ stocks have offered higher returns with lower volatility—a smoother ride, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Groups including BlackRock, Microsoft, Nvidia, and xAI join forces to acquire Aligned Data Centers — $40B deal delivers 5GW of operational and planned data center capacity

Who knew they could all work together? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Asset management firm BlackRock has joined forces with Microsoft, Nvidia, and xAI to purchase Aligned Data Centers (Aligned) through an investment consortium called the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP). Aligned is one of the largest data center companies in the world, having a total of planned and operational capacity of 5GW spread across 50 campuses. According to the company, the data center operator is present globally, including sites in Northern Virginia, Chicago, Dallas, Ohio, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Sao Paulo (Brazil), Queretaro (Mexico), and Santiago (Chile). Aside from AIP, other partners in the deal also included MGX, an AI investment firm owned and funded by the Abu Dhabi government in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), the Kuwait Investment Authority, and Temasek, a state-owned investment company owned by the Singapore Minister for Finance. These investments show how state-owned funds are interested in diving into artificial intelligence, either through their own infrastructure, like the Stargate AI project in the UAE, or through monetary contributions to projects like these. Other companies, like Cisco Systems, GE Vernova, and Next Era Energy, are also part of the partnership as technology and power providers. But what’s more interesting is how some of the biggest names in AI joined together to form AIP. BlackRock, GIP, Microsoft, and MGX founded the partnership in September 2024, with Nvidia and xAI joining later. Even though it took more than a year for the group to make its first purchase, it’s a massive one — the deal is expected to cost $40 billion, making it one of the most expensive data center purchases in history. This combination of capital and technical expertise would help Aligned stay ahead in the global AI race. “Partnering with the Consortium will accelerate our mission to deliver the infrastructure powering tomorrow’s digital economy,” Aligned Data Centers CEO Andrew Schaap said. “With AIP, MGX, and GIP’s global reach, extensive resources, and deep expertise across AI, energy, and finance, we are poised to scale faster, innovate further, and redefine what’s possible in sustainable data center infrastructure.” AIP expects to complete the deal by the first half of 2026, provided it passes regulatory oversight.

The billionaire CEO was "giddy" on Tuesday's earnings call, per BI's Bradley Saacks, when describing the success of the firm's private markets business. That includes the red-hot private-credit sector, where investors lend directly to borrowers. Despite representing just a fraction of the $13.5 trillion firm's total assets, BlackRock's private markets business has been booming. The fees from the business unit are up 136% this year compared to the same time period last year. "I've never been more excited about the future of BlackRock," said Fink on the call. In the other corner, you have JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon, who didn't mince words when talking about the recent auto industry bankruptcies that have reignited questions about the risks of non-bank lending. "When you see one cockroach, there's probably more," said Dimon on the bank's earnings call regarding the potential for more high-profile blowups. Fink and Dimon's thoughts illustrate the boom-or-bust argument that has accompanied the rise of private credit, or non-bank lending. And with Blackstone and Apollo, both big players in the space, reporting earnings in the coming weeks, the dialogue won't be ending anytime soon. Being able to borrow from someone besides the big banks has been a welcome change for some. And the investors willing to fill the void — and take the risk — have often been rewarded handsomely. But others, most notably Dimon, have continued to sound the alarm about the risks associated with the rise of lenders not held to the same tight standards as banks. The private-credit debate isn't as simple as pitting banks against non-bank lenders. There's a lot more nuance, including the fact that many large banks have launched their own private-credit arms. (JPMorgan set aside an additional $50 billion for private credit earlier this year.) "People are very focused on how banks and non-banks are going to go head-to-head and compete with each other in the space. The reality is, the real game will be the ones who figure out how to partner with each other," Troy Rohrbaugh, the co-CEO of JPMorgan's commercial and investment bank, told me this January in Davos. One industry both sides will likely continue to pursue is artificial intelligence. Private credit's benefits — speed, creative financing, easy access — are exactly what tech companies are looking for as they spend big to build out their infrastructure empires. But another benefit of private credit — the lack of public disclosures compared to traditional loans — also represents one of its greatest risks. That secrecy benefits borrowers, but further complicates the already convoluted ways companies are financing their AI push. 1. Andrew Ross Sorkin has seen this stock-market play before … sort of. The CNBC host swears the timing of "1929", his new book that covers the infamous stock market crash, is a mere coincidence. Still, Sorkin told BI's William Edwards that he's concerned that some of those same elements are playing out in today's AI stock market frenzy. 2. A silver lining for another precious metal. Silver smashed a new record, hitting $53.55 in London. Investors have been flocking to precious metals as safe havens, but a short squeeze fueled its surge as silver has faced growing concerns over its inventory in London. 3. Goldman Sachs revamps its OneGS program, but there's a price to pay. The AI-driven overhaul, newly dubbed "OneGS 3.0" will "re-wire" the bank's operations and leverage AI to accelerate its efficiency goals. That comes with a headcount restraint and a "limited reduction" of some roles, though. Read the memo Goldman sent to staff. 1. A glimpse into Jensen Huang's inner circle. The Nvidia CEO has 36 direct reports as of this month, according to an internal list obtained by BI. Huang is known for having more direct reports than his peers to help with information flow. Last year, he said he had 55. Here's the list. 2. Spotify is adding parental controls. The new settings will block videos, podcasts, and explicit content for Family Accounts where parents can monitor what kids consume. It's about time, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. 3. This AI bubble isn't feeling very bubbly. Some tech leaders and Wall Street execs keep saying we're in an AI bubble. But unless you're in a very specific industry or part of the world, it probably doesn't feel like it. That's because this bubble is not like the others, writes BI's Peter Kafka. 1. Plight of the trophy husband. Couples are more likely to divorce when the woman earns more than the man, a 2023 study found. A majority of the breadwinning women who spoke to BI said money negatively affected their relationships — but some have figured out how to make it work. 2. Former Miss USA says she feels "vindicated" after Miss Universe lawsuit. Noelia Voigt became the first Miss USA to resign after what her mother called "eight months of abuse and torture" by ex-CEO Laylah Rose. For Voigt, Miss Universe's lawsuit against Rose is a step in the right direction, though she said it covers only a "small percentage" of what she went through. 3. Disney's DEI approach that doesn't say DEI. The Mouse House kicks off its first-ever "Global Belonging Week" for employees, from October 20 to 24, according to an email viewed by BI. The event's itinerary notably includes less politically charged words like "belonging" instead of "diversity" and "equity." One workplace expert said the word choice is a sign of the times.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Do you already hold Nvidia stock? You may want to think about retaining it. Are you planning to buy in? This could be your opportunity. Nvidia has emerged the most important semiconductor player in the AI space, driven by its advanced GPU architectures that form the backbone of AI training and inference workloads across industries. The stock has surged 30% this year, and remains up about 90% from its April 2025 lows. Reflect on the following information. While we prefer to buy dips if the fundamentals are strong — for NVDA, see Buy or Sell NVDA Stock — we remain cautious about falling knives. Particularly, it’s essential to determine whether, if conditions worsen and NVDA declines another 20-30% to $126 levels, we could maintain our position in the stock. What is the worst-case scenario? We refer to this as downturn resilience. Interestingly, the stock has performed worse than the S&P 500 index during several economic downturns. We evaluate this based on both (a) how much the stock declined and (b) the speed of its recovery. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant value in a broader diversified strategy that we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Let us pose this question: Over the past 5 years, which index do you believe the Trefis High Quality Portfolio outperformed — the S&P 500, the S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework helps stack the odds in your favor. Here are the specifics, but first, as a brief background: NVDA offers graphics, compute, and networking solutions for gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive markets worldwide, in strategic partnership with Kroger Co. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 Covid Pandemic 2018 Correction 2008 Global Financial Crisis Concerned that NVDA may drop significantly further? You might want to explore the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks renowned for comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which encompasses all three — the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What’s the reason? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk than the benchmark index; providing a smoother investment journey, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

WSB Now A group including BlackRock, Nvidia and Microsoft is buying Aligned Data Centers in an approximately $40 billion deal in an effort to expand next-generation cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure. The acquisition comes amid a flurry of deals in recent months involving top AI developers that are flooding the booming AI sector with resources and money, and addressing resources -- such as electricity and infrastructure -- needed to support such technology. Last week it was revealed that semiconductor maker AMD will supply its chips to artificial intelligence company OpenAI as part of an agreement to team up on building AI infrastructure. OpenAI will also get the option to buy as much as a 10% stake in AMD, according to a joint statement announcing the deal. Last month, OpenAI and Nvidia announced a $100 billion partnership that will add at least 10 gigawatts of data center computing power. Aligned’s portfolio includes 50 campuses and more than 5 gigawatts of operational and planned capacity, including assets under development, mostly located across the U.S. and in Latin America. Some locations include northern Virginia; Chicago; Dallas; Ohio; Phoenix; Salt Lake City; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Queretaro, Mexico; and Santiago, Chile. Aligned, which is privately held, will continue to be led by CEO Andrew Schaap and keep its headquarters in Dallas. One of the sellers, Macquarie Asset Management, initially invested in Aligned in 2018. Ben Way, head of Macquarie Asset Management, said in a statement, “The scaling of Aligned Data Centers from two locations to 50 in seven years is representative of our approach to working with great companies and teams to support their rapid growth and deliver positive impact.” The transaction is the first deal for the investment consortium, which is named the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership. The consortium has an initial target of mobilizing and deploying $30 billion of equity capital, with the potential of reaching $100 billion including debt. “AIP is positioned to meet the growing demand for the infrastructure required as AI continues to reshape the global economy," BlackRock Chairman and CEO and AIP Chairman Larry Fink said in a statement. “This partnership is bringing together leading companies and mobilizing private capital to accelerate AI innovation and drive global economic growth and productivity.” The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026.

Title: Still not ready for Black Friday 2025? Here is your last minute rescue plan
URL: https://yoast.com/last-minute-black-friday-tips/
Time Published: 2025-10-15T13:20:49Z

Drive more traffic to your site. Use AI to save time doing SEO tasks. Make SEO easier. And get 24/7 support. Includes Local SEO, Video SEO & News SEO. Heads up! Black Friday is almost here, and if you still haven’t prepared, it’s time to act fast. The clock is ticking, but you can still make meaningful updates that count. This article covers practical and straightforward last minute Black Friday tips to help you make quick, effective changes to your eCommerce store. Even with just a few days left, there’s still room to attract customers and make the most of the biggest shopping event of the year. Did you know? Numbers show that Black Friday 2024 broke all records, as U.S. shoppers spent a staggering $ 10.8 billion online, representing a 10.2 percent increase from 2023. These numbers prove one thing: it is never too late to take action and grab your share of the Black Friday rush. The fastest way to put your Black Friday campaign on pilot mode is by focusing on a few essentials that make an immediate difference. These must-do, last minute Black Friday tips are your quick wins, helping you cover the basics, build momentum, and set up the foundation for a successful marketing campaign. When shoppers land on your website, your Black Friday deals should be impossible to miss. Highlight your best offers right on the homepage or add a static banner so visitors see them immediately. The clearer your offers are, the easier it is for customers to take action. One of the most innovative ways to increase engagement is by using countdown timers. They build urgency, encourage faster decisions, and make shoppers feel like they’re part of something time-sensitive. The Diamond Store saw this in action when they added a live countdown clock to their 24-hour Black Friday email campaign. The result? A 400% higher conversion rate compared to their previous emails. For WordPress users, OptinMonster is a quick way to get started. It lets you create dynamic floating bars and banners with countdowns, all through a simple drag-and-drop builder. If you’re using Shopify, the Essential Countdown Timer Bar app works perfectly for creating announcement bars or cart countdowns to drive urgency and prevent cart abandonment. Did you know a long or confusing checkout process is one of the biggest reasons shoppers abandon their carts, especially during high-traffic days like Black Friday? That’s the last thing you want when every second counts. Before the rush begins, take a few minutes to go through your own checkout process on both desktop and mobile. Place a test order just like a customer would. Verify that your discount codes are applied correctly, your payment options load smoothly, and the overall flow feels quick and effortless. Read more: Boost your checkout page UX: Vital tips for online stores Ask a few friends, family members, or even teammates to try it too. Fresh eyes often spot friction points you might miss, such as unclear buttons, confusing forms, or slow-loading pages. Trust also plays a huge role. Ensure your checkout page displays secure payment badges and recognizable gateways, such as PayPal, Apple Pay, or Stripe. When shoppers feel confident their payment is safe, they’re far more likely to hit “Buy now.” And one last tip: keep it simple. The fewer distractions and clicks, the smoother the path to purchase. That’s precisely what drives conversions during a last minute Black Friday rush. Black Friday emails have been shown to generate 33 percent higher conversion rates than regular marketing messages. That alone makes it one of the smartest last minute Black Friday tips to focus on. When time is short, your existing customer base is your best asset. They already trust your brand and are far more likely to act quickly on your offers. Keep your email focused and straightforward. Start with a subject line that clearly highlights your best deal or most significant discount. For example, in the screenshot below, you can see how the key offer or discount is prominently displayed in the subject line, while the body reinforces the offer with a clear call to action. Inside the email, make your main offer impossible to miss. Emphasize the key benefits of your product or service, and include a direct call to action that takes users straight to your Black Friday sale page. Make it visually engaging by adding a countdown timer or a short GIF that brings energy and urgency to the message. Remember, this isn’t about crafting a perfect campaign. It’s about getting the right message to the right people at the right time. A simple, well-timed email can make a real difference in your Black Friday sales. Social media continues to play a significant role in Black Friday success. It has seen a 7 percent year-over-year increase in traffic, now driving around 10 percent of all global mobile traffic referrals during the holiday season. Your audience is already scrolling, searching, and shopping, so this is your opportunity to be where they are. In these last few days, your social media strategy should focus on building anticipation and trust. If you have customer review videos, testimonials, or any user-generated content, start sharing them now. Boosting these posts or running quick ad campaigns featuring real customer stories can help you build credibility fast. People are far more likely to buy when they see genuine experiences from others. You can also collaborate with a micro-influencer or a brand advocate who already has a connection with your target audience. Even a brief post, story, or reel from them can draw attention to your sale and help you gain visibility. If you are short on time, focus only on your most active platform, whether that is Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, or LinkedIn. Post your best offer as a pinned post or a story highlight and use countdown stickers or short video snippets to create a sense of urgency. Lastly, remember to engage. Reply to comments, answer questions, and reshare posts from happy customers. Small interactions can make your brand feel more approachable and help you stand out during the Black Friday rush. Must read: How to handle comments on your blog If you haven’t touched your SEO yet, don’t worry. There’s still time to make a few quick updates that can help your store appear in the search results. These last minute Black Friday SEO tweaks can enhance visibility, attract the right audience, and might give your deals a competitive edge. Start with your meta titles and meta descriptions. Add words like Black Friday 2025, sale, or deal to your titles so searchers know what to expect. For example, instead of ‘Women’s handbags – Classic collection,’ you can try ‘Black Friday 2025 deals on women’s handbags.’ Keep it relevant, natural, and clear. Next, check your product and landing pages. Make sure they’re up to date with current pricing, stock status, and offers. Highlight the discounts in your product descriptions, and, if possible, include keywords that shoppers might search for, such as ‘best Black Friday deals’ or ‘holiday gift offers.’ Another smart move is to reuse your existing content. If you already have an older Black Friday or holiday gift guide, simply refresh it for 2025 by updating the year, offers, and internal links. It’s a fast way to keep your content relevant without having to start from scratch. Lastly, take a minute to review your page experience. A fast, mobile-friendly site can make or break your Black Friday sales. Run a quick check using Google’s PageSpeed Insights and fix anything that’s slowing your pages down. Even minor improvements can help increase conversions. These quick wins may not replace a comprehensive Black Friday SEO strategy. However, they can still make your website more discoverable and help you capture traffic from shoppers actively seeking deals. Okay, so the must-dos can help you frame a solid last minute marketing campaign. But if you’ve managed to check those off quickly and still have a little time on your hands, don’t stop there. The following few ideas may seem optional, but they can give your campaign the extra boost it needs to capture more attention, convert hesitant shoppers, and capitalize on the Black Friday rush. Don’t let potential buyers slip away after visiting your store. Retargeting ads help remind them of products they viewed or added to their carts, increasing the chances of conversion. Even a short, time-bound campaign with strong visuals and clear CTAs can make a difference during the Black Friday rush. Shoppers love convenience, especially during the holidays. Bundling complementary products or creating quick gift sets can simplify decision-making and increase your average order value. Highlight these as limited-time deals to develop a sense of urgency and drive faster sales. Many customers abandon their carts when questions go unanswered. Adding a live chat feature helps resolve last minute queries instantly and keeps buyers engaged throughout the checkout process. Tools like Tidio and LiveChat integrate seamlessly with both WordPress and Shopify, making setup quick and easy. Getting your offers in front of the right people starts with how your website appears and performs in search results. That’s where Yoast SEO can be a real game-changer during the Black Friday rush.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET) stock dropped by 6% on October 14, and is now trading at $139. This decline was triggered by investor concern over new reports.

A newly formed investment group made up of BlackRock, Nvidia, xAI, Microsoft and others will acquire Aligned Data Centers in a $40 billion deal, the companies said Wednesday. The move adds fuel to a growing land grab for infrastructure to support artificial intelligence development. The consortium, called the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), plans to deploy $30 billion in equity capital to begin with, and could invest as much as $100 billion when debt is included. This is the group’s first transaction, and it signals how central data infrastructure has become to the next phase of AI development. Aligned designs and operates data centers for clients including hyperscalers, enterprise firms and newer cloud providers. It controls 50 campuses across the U.S. and Latin America with more than 5 gigawatts of operating and planned capacity, including properties still under development. The acquisition comes amid a scramble to secure the compute power needed for AI workloads. Last month, Nebius Group signed a five-year agreement to supply Microsoft with $17.4 billion worth of GPUs. Around the same time, CoreWeave reached a $6.3 billion deal with Nvidia to reserve its unused server space. The Aligned deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026. Shares of bitcoin mining firms, particularly those that have shfited business models to AI infrastructure, are continuing to post gains. In early trading. Hut 8 Corp (HUT), IREN (IREN), Bitfarms (BITF) and CleanSpark (CLSK) were ahead in the 3%-6% range.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From THE DAILY CALLER Audrey StrebDCNF Energy Reporter Major global asset managers including BlackRock and Blackstone have been looking to buy power utilities across America in a move that some industry insiders warn could harm consumers, raise electricity costs and advance a climate-driven energy agenda. In recent months, Blackstone reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy utilities in New Mexico and Texas all while a BlackRock-led group won approval Friday to purchase a major utility in Minnesota. While BlackRock and other huge asset managers have distanced themselves from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment practices in recent years, some energy experts and consumer advocates that spoke to the Daily Caller News Foundation are concerned that buying up utilities may represent a new frontier of financial giants orchestrating “climate mandates.” “BlackRock isn’t just influencing utilities anymore, they’re buying them. After years of ESG-driven coercion that pushed utilities to abandon reliable energy in favor of China-dependent renewables, BlackRock is now taking direct control. The result will be more of the same: higher costs, weaker grids, and millions in unpaid bills, all driven by the very climate mandates they lobbied for,” Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, told the DCNF. “Minnesotans should brace for more unreliable power, rising rates, and a media narrative that blames Trump for ending taxpayer-funded handouts instead of holding the woke politicians and Wall Street elites responsible for the crisis.” (RELATED: A Major Backer Of Green Energy Admits Again That Solar And Wind Power Alone ‘Can’t Reliably Keep The Lights On’) Electricity demand is on the rise after years of stagnancy as the artificial intelligence (AI) race ushers in the build out of power-hungry data centers. Utility costs are also spiking as demand takes off in a trend that dates back to the Biden administration. Against this backdrop, private investment titans like BlackRock and Blackstone are reportedly moving to buy power utility companies and invest in data center expansions and startups. Minnesota recently granted the BlackRock-led group known as Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) approval to buy one of the state’s major power utilities, Allete. GIP is also reportedly on the cusp of acquiring the major energy company, AES, according to sources familiar with the matter that spoke with Reuters. The Financial Times reported that the deal may be for $38 billion. BlackRock referred the DCNF to Allete’s statement on regulators approving its partnership with GIP and declined to comment further for this story. Allete’s statement notes that the impending partnership with the BlackRock-led group includes “guaranteed access to capital to fund ALLETE’s five-year plan for advancing transmission and renewable energy goals [and a] $50 million Clean Firm Technology Fund to support regional clean-energy projects and partnerships.” The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) renewed BlackRock’s ability to own up to 20% of utility voting shares in April, with former FERC Commissioner Mark Christie stating that BlackRock “pledged not to use its holdings to influence utility management” and that utilities need the access to capital. Christie also warned in September 2024 that “this is an issue that deserves much greater scrutiny” and that “the influence that large shareholders, BlackRock or otherwise, can potentially exert across the consumer-serving utility industry should not be underestimated.” Blackstone has reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy out the Public Service Company of New Mexico and Texas New Mexico Power Co. recently, according to The Associated Press. The asset management giant also secured a 19.9% stake in a Northern Indiana public utility for over $2 billion in January 2024. “Blackstone’s sustainability strategy prioritizes accelerating decarbonization by investing in the energy transition and driving value accretive emissions reduction in our portfolio,” Blackstone’s 2024 sustainability report states. “We believe the transition to cleaner energy creates meaningful investment opportunities for private capital. For over a decade, we have pursued attractive investments in companies and assets that are part of the global energy transition as part of our broader energy investing strategy.” Blackstone also announced on Sept. 15 that private equity funds affiliated with Blackstone Energy Transition Partners will acquire the Pennsylvania-based Hill Top Energy Center natural gas plant for almost $1 billion. The company also announced in July that funds managed by Blackstone Infrastructure and Blackstone Real Estate would invest over $25 billion to help build out Pennsylvania’s energy infrastructure to support the AI “revolution.” “Renewable” energy goals and ESG investment tend to align with emissions-reduction targets, with some power companies, utilities and states that set goals to cut emissions striving to retire conventional energy sources like coal plants. Isaac added that companies like American Electric Power, in which BlackRock owns a significant stake, have been decommissioning coal plants and replacing them with intermittent sources like solar. “What happens is when the wind stops blowing and the sun stops shining, then you have to ramp those generational assets back up, and that’s when price spikes happen,” Isaac said. (RELATED: ‘A Huge Win’: Woke ‘Cartel’ Of Financial Giants Dealt Death Blow 11 Days Before Trump Takes Office) University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance Greg Brown told the AP that the reason behind these buyouts are “very simple. Because there’s a lot of money to be made.” Other experts devoted to consumer protection like Executive Director of Consumers’ Research Will Hild told the DCNF that investment companies like BlackRock stand to gain more than just a profit from these purchases. “There is no world in which BlackRock’s ownership of American energy benefits ordinary American consumers,” Hild told the DCNF. “This is the same firm that proudly brought us the radical ESG rules and Net-Zero nonsense that forced all our energy bills to skyrocket. We wouldn’t have the scourge of woke capitalism without Larry Fink, who already controls nearly $13 trillion in assets and has been sued for violating anti-trust laws.” ESG investors weigh a company by its social and environmental choices as well as its finances in a move that critics say bogs down businesses with new costs while doing little to combat climate change. One August 2023 InfluenceMap report showed that as Republicans at the state level and in Congress ramped up their opposition to ESG-focused practices, BlackRock and other major U.S. asset managers decreased their support for climate-related resolutions. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also said in June 2023 that he no will no longer use the term ESG because it has been “politicized,” less than a year after he noted that climbing energy prices are “accelerating” the green energy transition. “BlackRock has backpedaled on its ESG messaging and its aggressive, unapologetic imposition of ESG on everything they touch. But the leopard hasn’t changed its spots,” President of the Heartland Institute James Taylor told the DCNF. “It still has the same management group with the same values, and it’s still doing whatever it can to impose ESG on everything it touches, in actuality, if not in name.” Taylor argued that whether BlackRock buys or acquires a large stake of a utility, it “can now assert itself over legislatures in dictating energy policy.” Notably, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) threw their weight behind an antitrust lawsuit against major asset managers that alleges the firms colluded to tank coal production with their embrace of zero-emissions goals in May. The lawsuit, backed by 11 state attorneys general, alleges that BlackRock and multiple other asset managers used their market power to suppress coal production, thereby hurting consumers by causing the price of coal to climb. The DOJ and FTC’s “support for this baseless case undermines the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” a BlackRock spokesperson previously told the DCNF. “As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production.” Blackstone did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment.

It was deliberate policy by the greens in Democratic administrations, who were also ignoring the reliability effects of doing so. BlackRock and Blackstone have been looking to buy power utilities across America Quite literally, a power grab. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, met with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves at Downing Street. With $10 trillion under management, BlackRock is more than a financial institution—it’s a shadow government shaping economies and societies across the globe. … The message was clear: BlackRock is not just an investment firm; it’s a stakeholder in the UK’s political and economic future. https://labourheartlands.com/blackrocks-britain-how-corporate-giants-are-rewriting-the-social-contract/ BlackRock and Blackstone: Not building better worlds. And Larry Fink should not be allowed to take any stakes in any UK utility without leaving the USA, answering questions to the UK public, not their corrupted representatives. He is not a shadow government, he is a mafioso. He only cares about making money and his modus operandum is to make the majority pay far, far more. You can, sadly, count on Kier & Co to sell us all down the swannee… Kier Starmer decided a legal opinion was somehow binding (self-loathing, guilt etc) and is giving the Chagos islands – Diego Garcia and all – to Malaysia, a firm ally of Beijing; and it will cost us at least £30 odd billion for the privilege, but it does get worse – with Labour in charge it always does. UK and US security sources have confirmed to Guido local media reports and social media speculation that Mauritius has signed an agreement with India to allow New Delhi to set up a ‘satellite tracking station’ near Chagos. The facility will be on Mauritius territory – which now means the Chagos Islands – near the base area on Diego Garcia… Indian outlet The Economic Times describes the new base as a “strategic asset for monitoring the region”. It reported: “India and Mauritius also signed an agreement on hydrography to conduct joint surveys, prepare navigation charts and share hydrographic data of the Mauritius EEZ. Modi said India remained committed to enhancing maritime security and capacity of Mauritius.” – Guido Fawkes You completely miss the point. Larry Fink is not interested in money, but total power and control and pushing a transformative global Agenda with the aim to end national sovereignties . And for this he is willing to sacrifice billions, as many corporations already did by going woke. Blackrock is at the very center of green energy transition. Blackrock is also major stakeholder of the MIC companies (Raytheon etc). (now guess who is behind all those endless wars). And Larry Fink openly stated”We will force behavior ” Behavior is what you eat( the war on meat production), who you are allowed to criticize, that you must worship LGBT , love open borders(Fink is a huge fan of that) mandatory vaccination etc. It’s not only Keir Starmer and UK. ” Germanies” chancellor Merz is a Blackrock employee. And before Starmer , Sunak was a Goldman Sachs, Johnson had the same Goldman Sachs mentor, and Merkels bos…advisor was a Goldman Sachs. Blackrock is nothing more than the East India Company of the 21st century(even in a literal sense, while Vanguard is its branch of oligarchs that they established). Avi Yemeni asked the Blackrock CEO at Davos after a meeting with top politicians what he talked about with his employees rulers? Larry Fink did not answer. I wonder why? China has spent decades on its belt and road, worldwide. And now certain favours are being called in. The collapse of the spy trial is literally the tip of the iceberg. They don’t want to talk about that secret basement in the proposed Chinese Embassy. Only China would redact the architectural drawings. “Blackstone” and “BlackRock” are just different names for coal. When you electrify everything the oppoorunities for the utility to make money boggle the mind. Hmm. An asset manager taking over utility companies and doing things that raise prices while claiming that customers are better off for user hardships and asset manager profits. Seems unlikely. Green is the perfect scam. We need an independent source enabled to compete. (Enabling to compete has to be intentional/governmental, because the one you would compete against already has the advantage of intentional government enabling.) Or at least remove green’s rigged advantages? How is this different from what the current owners are doing? ‘Major global asset managers including BlackRock and Blackstone have been looking to buy power utilities across America in a move that some industry insiders warn could harm consumers, raise electricity costs and advance a climate-driven energy agenda.’ Large utility holding companies have been gobbling up local utilities for decades. Even if they don’t own generating assets, they promote renewables due to the need to increase the amount of transmission assets they have in rate base. Frank, As you likely know there were problems with utility holding companies in the 1920s. Adding luxury assets to utility rate base was one abuse of their government granted monopoly that was finally reined-in with the “used and useful” doctrine. I think this doctrine can be employed again. How would it be possible that generating sources with an inherent capacity factor (a capital utility or utilization factor) of 25% or less would not trigger an adverse “used and useful” finding that would limit what could be added to the rate base? I pointed this out in a summary I put together after Wyoming Senate fact-finding hearing in February 2024, but I’m not sure that anyone quite followed my reasoning. At least no one responded to it. The biggest problem is that public service commissions lack sufficient engineering help, and are also, generally, pretty ignorant of the history of electric utilities. They are also afraid of becoming entangled in court with big entities like Blackrock. By the way, I think Warren Buffet is well aware of how this could go — abuse the rate payers sufficiently and your utility ends up being owned by the State; an outcome that no one should cheer. ‘How would it be possible that generating sources with an inherent capacity factor (a capital utility or utilization factor) of 25% or less would not trigger an adverse “used and useful” finding that would limit what could be added to the rate base?’ Excellent point / question, Kevin! If I recall, prior to U&U, ‘gold plating’ of utility rate base, particularly generation, not only ensured higher earnings, but also minimized the number of pesky calls utility executives received from the control room in the middle of the night (or while playing golf). This, of course, also had the adverse effect that these surplus assets need not be run particularly efficiently. What’s apparent today is that many of the utilities here in the North East, that have long since undergone ‘deregulation’ (divested themselves of their generation assets), are now in cahoots with their blue state regulators (i.e., energy Marxists) to encourage the buildout of renewables as a means of stuffing more transmission and demand-side management (DSM) assets into rate base. That is exactly what National Grid has been doing in the UK, passing themselves off as a “neutral” party. Now with the split, NESO hold the planning remit. All the solutions they go for are for more grid, because it’s the same people. I am now pushing a narrative about stranded grid and renewables assets as a counterweight. Not sure how far I’ll get, but I do have some important ears listening to me. I am in the throes of putting together some analysis on the plans for extensive grid investment in the UK. Offshore wind has perhaps slightly better capacity factors as potential, but by the time you start looking at likely curtailment as capacity grows those rates fall dramatically. The result is heavy underutilisation of grid assets, pushing up bills. I looked at wind curtailment in 2024 which peaked at 7GW. I found you would struggle to justify much more than 1GW of extra transmission to try to handle it, even assuming you could find a market for the output. With low values when output gets curtailed the economics get even harder. Energy companies providing public utilities are regulated heavily by the State bureaucracy. They are guaranteed a profit no matter how poorly they mis-manage their plant and resources. They can pass almost all costs on to their customers. They are overseen in the end by politicians whose main goal is getting and keeping power and money. If the electorate is not “woke”, meaning aware and living in reality, God help us as they will take us down the path of ruin and energy shortages. Wind and solar energy have negative value on open markets. It cannot be dispatched to meet demand. Utilities only pay for it if they are mandated too. On that level I can’t see where renewables and making profit are connected. I am not seeing where owning the utility is the place to be if you want to promote them. If they only take power from wind/solar on a PPA, then all the utility can do is pass the purchase price on to the customer. If they can own the wind/solar plant, however, they can not only charge for O&M, taxes, and depreciation, but add the value of the plant to their rate base and earn 7.5% easily — in fact earn maybe 10% on their own contributed capital if they borrow say 50% at 5% interest. Building wind/solar is much faster than building thermal plants, thus bulks up rate base more quickly. I see this as an opportunity, none of these deals can move forward without regulatory approval. All future projects must provide a 24/7 power supply less down time for maintenance and updates. No project will be approved that depends on government money to stay afloat. No source of generation will have preference over another to the grid. No source will be paid for not generating power. No source will be guaranteed a certain rate. All sources must have end of service plans and money. I’m sure there should be other requirements but these are enough to insure a bright future for clean, reliable, safe and affordable fossil fuel and nuclear power. Subsidy mining is where it’s at as the climate changers are stuck between the Blackrocks and a hard place- ‘Money train continues’: Absurd number of subsidies to make sustainable energy viable When the lights begin to flicker they know there’ll be more slushfunding to kiss it better. “…the world’s most viewed climate website” – Fred Pearce The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming “…invaluable” – Steven F.

Today’s top news: 🧭 Larry Fink on Crypto: ETFs now, tokenization next BlackRock’s Larry Fink had a lot to say about crypto yesterday. And the primary takeaway - we’re just getting started. On CNBC yesterday, Larry Fink praised how spot Bitcoin ETFs opened the door for mainstream investors. Then he got specific on how tokenization is the future. The world he envisions includes mutual funds, private credit, money markets, even real-world assets issued as tokens, settling near-instantly, with compliance baked into the token (who can hold it, where it can move, when it can trade). He said BlackRock is building the tech to drop these products directly into digital wallets, cut settlement frictions, slash transfer/record-keeping costs, and give clients 24/7 portability. He also stressed that Bitcoin still has a role, but sized responsibly. “We’re just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets, from real estate to equity to bonds, across the board.” — Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, on CNBC CEO of world’s largest asset manager… “We're just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets.” Yes, includes ETFs. Larry Fink on his positively evolving attitude towards crypto: “I grow & learn.” Good lesson here. And some of you *still* think crypto is a scam. pic.twitter.com/GJ8oxWF3vK — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) October 15, 2025 ETFs are the on-ramp today; the bigger story is tokenizing pretty much everything tomorrow. This is the playbook from the world’s biggest asset manager: Overall, this means more people gaining access to these investment products, which is a win. And they’ll be able to trade more efficiently via blockchain with lower fees - win win. But it might not be a complete win. Ethereum was largely expected to be the home of RWA tokenization. If that happens on BlackRock’s own rails (and other banks / institutions follow suit), that does hurt one aspect of the Ethereum bull case. But there also may be a world where bringing that amount of assets and asset types onchain is more net bullish overall than it is bearish to the Ethereum tokenization bull case.

Stock futures are rising as investors monitor developments on U.S.-China trade tensions and digest strong earnings reports from major financial institutions; the Fed’s Beige Book will offer some economic insights amid a data blackout due to the federal government shutdown; ASML Holding shares are rising after the semiconductor equipment maker reported better-than-expected quarterly income; and Jeep-maker Stellantis plans to invest $13 billion in U.S. production. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving higher after major indexes turned in a mixed performance yesterday amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 1% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.8% and Dow Jones Industrial Average Futures added 0.5%. Gold futures were up more than 1% at $4,215 an ounce, as the precious metal continues hitting record highs amid economic uncertainty and stock market volatility. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading at $112,000, down from from an overnight high of $113,600 and well below its all-time high of $126,000 set early last week. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which can influence a variety of consumer loans, was holding steady at 4.02%, near a five-week low. Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) this morning released quarterly results that beat Wall Street expectations, joining several other major institutions that released strong earnings reports yesterday. Bank of America reported third-quarter revenue of $28.24 billion, better than the $27.5 billion expected from analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, while its earnings per share of $1.06 topped the consensus view of 95 cents. Morgan Stanley reported revenue of $18.2 billion, compared with the consensus estimate of $16.69 billion, while EPS of $2.80 came in above estimates of $2.11. Investors will be keeping tabs on what bank executives are saying about the outlook for their businesses after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned Tuesday "of uncertainty stemming from complex geopolitical conditions, tariffs and trade uncertainty, elevated asset prices and the risk of sticky inflation." Shares of Bank of America and Morgan Stanley were up more than 4% in recent premarket trading. With data releases delayed as the federal government shutdown enters its third week, investors will be closely watching today’s 2 p.m. ET release of the Federal Reserve’s “Beige Book.” The Beige Book provides a summary of economic conditions in each of the 12 regions of the Federal Reserve and is published two weeks before each Fed meeting, with the next scheduled for Oct. 28-29. While investors won’t get the Consumer Price Index report for September that was originally scheduled for release today, that report will be published on Oct. 24, as officials said that the data was needed to determine Social Security payment levels. ASML Holding (ASML) shares are rising in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker reported better-than-expected income and sought to reassure investors on 2026 sales, even as its third quarter sales came in below analysts' estimates. ASML reported quarterly revenue of 7.516 billion euros ($8.74 billion), compared with expectations of 7.67 billion euros ($8.92 billion) from analysts tracked by Visible Alpha. Net income of 2.125 billion euros ($2.47 billion) was above the analyst consensus of 2.083 billion ($2.42 billion). The company said it expected 2026 sales to exceed 2025 levels, but would provide more information in January. ASML warned in July that it couldn’t guarantee growth in 2026 due to ongoing trade tensions with China. ASML shares, which have gained more than 40% since the start of the year, rose more than 4% ahead of the bell. Big Three automaker Stellantis (STLA) said it would invest $13 billion into U.S. auto manufacturing over the next four years, the largest single investment in the company’s 100-year U.S. history. The investment will support the introduction of five new vehicles across the company’s brands, which includes Jeep and Chrysler, and the addition of 5,000 new jobs at plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. The automaker recently reported a rise in third-quarter U.S. sales, which snapped a two-year streak of year-over-year sales declines. Shares of Stellantis were up 0.5% in recent premarket trading.

Title: AI Bubble May Pop — Wiping Out $40 Trillion. Learn What Could Happen And What To Do

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. The generative AI boom is characterized by massive debt accumulation, projected to reach $1.5 trillion for infrastructure by 2028, and concerning circular financing schemes where investors fund customers who then buy their products.Significant financial instability is evident from OpenAI's high cash burn and the 95% failure rate of AI pilot projects, raising doubts about the sector's actual return on investment and profitability. The generative AI boom grew even bigger this week when Open AI announced its latest multibillion-dollar chip deal, this time with Broadcom – sending its stock up 10%, CNBC reported. The agreement, along with pacts with AMD and Oracle, is one of many that’s pumping money into an AI bubble that looks like it could end much like the dot-com bubble did. Will it end liked the dot-com collapse — which sent the Nasdaq down 78%? If such a value decimation began today, it would ultimately swipe $40 trillion from the Nasdaq’s market capitalization. Or will the Gen AI boom continue for decades? Read on to learn how to tell which scenario is most likely. In March 2000, the dot-com bubble – which began with the 1995 initial public offering of Netscape – began bursting. The collapse subtracted $3.6 trillion from the Nasdaq’s market capitalization. There was also lots of debt -- $500 billion borrowed to build fiber optic networks went largely unrepaid due to the bankruptcy of telecom providers such as WorldCom and Global Crossing. While the Nasdaq began declining from its peak on March 10, two events on March 20, 2000 lit the fuse to this cash conflagration. That day "Burning Up," a Barron’s cover story by Jack Willoughby – who interviewed me for the article – was published. Willoughby’s column listed 51 publicly traded Internet firms he forecast would burn through their cash out of 207 by March 2001. That same day, MicroStrategy – whose CEO Michael Saylor is now Executive Chairman leading the renamed company’s strategy of selling stock to buy bitcoin – announced a revenue restatement for 1998 to 1999 due to "aggressive accounting practices," according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. MicroStrategy’s accounting irregularities further shattered investor confidence. By April, the company also restated 1997 results – news of which sent the stock down 91% from its peak. The GenAI boom has certain parallels with the dot-com one. There is OpenAI – the cash incinerating startup driving the hype; debt-heavy infrastructure operators such as CoreWeave; and cash rich providers of customer financing – notably Nvidia and Oracle – to encourage those cash-burning startups to buy more of their picks and shovels, about which I wrote in my book Brain Rush. To build data centers, infrastructure operators are borrowing more than $1 trillion, according to a recent Morgan Stanley study. This could end badly if the cash required to repay that debt is insufficient to cover interest payments. I see three scenarios: GenAI keeps booming, there’s a soft-landing in which valuations decline somewhat, and the OpenAI bankruptcy scenario which brings it all down abruptly should the company be unable to raise more capital to fund its money-losing operations. The bursting of the dot-com bubble wiped out more equity – much of it held by individuals because so many dot-com companies had gone public – than debt. But the unpaid debt damaged lenders and other institutions. For example, WorldCom’s $41 billion bankruptcy and Global Crossing’s $12.4 billion collapse resulted from debt service way in excess of their money losing operations’ ability to repay. During the telecom boom, companies laid 80 million miles of fiber optic cable – between 85% and 95% of which remained unused years after the crash, The Bubble Bubble reported. Today’s GenAI boom could wipe out a significant amount of privately held equity value. While it does not appear a peak has been reached, the debt taken on to finance the building of AI data centers is expected to be even larger than it was during the dot-com boom. Major tech companies pledged a record $320 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, Fortune wrote. That number is growing so much that capex is forecast to reach $2 trillion by 2028 – a whopping $1.5 trillion of which will come from various forms of debt, according to Morgan Stanley. Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft generate massive cash flows. But the growth in debt to build AI data centers highlights the strain on their internal resources. The Morgan Stanley report suggests external financing, including high-cost private credit deals, is necessary to supplement their free cash flow. Investors should note Oracle’s recent experience: the company is already losing $100 million quarterly on its data center rentals to OpenAI noted AInvest despite signing a $300 billion, five-year deal, as I wrote in a September Forbes post. If Oracle — a relatively disciplined operator— can’t make AI infrastructure profitable, who can? The most alarming parallel to 2000 involves circular financing arrangements in which a company finances its customer’s purchases. Nvidia, Microsoft and others are now engaging in this practice. Here are five examples: These circular deals are not enough to satisfy OpenAI’s ambition. The company aims to build 250 gigawatts of new computing capacity by 2033 with a price tag exceeding $10 trillion, noted Bloomberg. What if enterprises – which are consuming much of the the data center capacity being built to train and operate AI chatbots – decide they are wasting their money? With 95% of AI pilot projects failing to to yield meaningful results, according to MIT NANDA, that absence of a return on their $40 billion investment could come soon if a recession is near. What could trigger a bursting of the AI boom? OpenAI needs to reach $125 billion in revenue just to break even—a target not expected until 2029, Reuters reported. Until then, the ChatGPT provider must finance its losses by raising capital. A loss of confidence in the industry’s ability to borrow money to build more AI data centers could send investors scrambling for the exits. However, given the small number of publicly-traded AI chatbot providers, it is difficult to envision another article like Willoughby’s March 2000 “Burning Up” – which was based on dozens of public companies likely to burn through their cash. Differences between today and 2000 may make a GenAI crash less severe. Unlike the dot-com era’s 2,288 IPOs, noted International Banker, many of today’s AI companies remain private. More than 300 enterprise software unicorns are trapped without exits. Their median age is “11.5 years, and 50% need to raise or exit within 12 months,” wrote SaaStr. The relatively small number of GenAI IPOs could limit the damage of a crash. In 2000, retail investors were borrowing money to bet on publicly-traded Internet companies which collapsed after they burned through their cash. Retail investors’ losses spread the dot-com collapse’s pain more widely. If recently public GenAI companies – such as CoreWeave or SoundHound -- were to implode, their relatively small number might limit the damage. Another thing that’s better about today is the high profitability of many of the tech giants betting on AI. Today, the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 contribute 28.8% of total earnings – a big jump from 2000’s 16.1%, reported Fortune. Investors should prepare for three scenarios: To get a sense of which scenario is most likely investors should monitor these indicators: When today’s equivalent of Willoughy’s Barron’s article appears — providing specific data on which companies will run out of cash when — the psychological foundation will crack. The question is not if such a moment comes, but when, and whether the AI boom’s stronger fundamentals can cushion the fall that dot-com’s relative lack of substance made inevitable.

Title: 4 New AI Jobs That Pay Up To $200,000+ In 2026

ByRachel Wells, Contributor. We hear a lot about AI disrupting the workforce and making millions of jobs obsolete. We’ve seen AI-related layoffs last year and this year, with plans being drawn up for more layoffs at large companies like Amazon. But what roles is artificial intelligence actually creating? What are the new jobs of the future, the roles that will be in high demand in 2026 and beyond? In this article, you’ll learn about four AI jobs that you’ve probably never heard of, which offer eye-watering lucrative salaries of up to $200,000 and above. These will be the hot jobs of 2026 and will continue to grow in demand as AI implementation is rolled out across organizations. Keep reading to discover what these AI jobs are, the responsibilities involved, and how much they pay: This is the hottest new addition to the C-suite in 2025 and will continue to rise in demand in 2026. According to Asana’s Global State of AI at Work report, companies that have experienced the most success in terms of ROI and productivity when it comes to rolling out AI across their organizations, have designated roles in place, and have a strong strategy, treating it as a business-critical resource (82%). Part of this strategy involves having someone dedicated to AI implementation, digital transformation, and AI ethics and policy in the organization. This has carved the way for this new role, Chief AI Officer, who sits at the executive level and oversees all things AI implementation and strategy. Because this role, and many of the others listed below, are fairly new, we still don’t have access to broad numbers of salary data. However, based on the available information from salary comparison sites such as ZipRecruiter, Glassdoor, and analyzing job listings, here is what you can expect as an average pay rate in the U.S.: Average salary: $259,502 (some companies offer eye-watering pay packages in excess of $1 million) As a generative AI content expert, you would be optimizing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), by creating high-quality training data, using your own judgment to close gaps of information, and using your creativity to train AI models that produce the best outputs. An AI content expert or strategist’s job title can also refer to using AI tools to create and deliver a content schedule on behalf of a business, using your eye for detail to tweak the output and ensure accuracy while maintaining the company’s voice. Because this title is used to mean different responsibilities, take time to thoroughly review the job description before applying, so you know what you’re getting into. This role is best suited for professionals with extensive writing experience and a strong grasp on grammar, original creativity, problem-solving, and attention to detail. Having STEM background may also be preferred by some employers. Average salary: $55,000 to $90,000+ (there aren’t many advertized salaries in this field yet) An applied AI engineer builds, develops, and deploys customized AI solutions for a business to use internally and for their clients. Many of these roles are associated with building and deploying AI agents, which are the buzzword in workplaces right now. These customized solutions enable a business to implement AI and work at scale, using artificial intelligence in a way that best works for their needs, rendering them more effective when it comes to AI integration, or AI scalers, as Asana's State of AI report refers to them. As an example of what you’d be expected to deliver in this role, a job posting by The General Intelligence Company of New York says: When describing what they’d look for in their ideal Applied AI Agent Engineer candidate, the job posting says: Average salary: $154,442 When AI is being rolled out in an organization, there has to be guardrails in place. Otherwise, the company can incur great risk. One thing Asana’s report noted is that AI infrastructure requires three Ps: policy, psychological safety, and performance. The first P, policy, is where an AI ethics lead comes in. You’ll be responsible for “developing clear frameworks that provide guardrails without bureaucracy, defining who does what, when AI is appropriate, and how quality gets maintained.” This ensures safe practices for users as well as those on the receiving end of the output. As an example, OpenAI is currently hiring for a software engineer for AI safety, and the salary on offer is $210,000 – $325,000 plus equity. Average salary: $242,471 To succeed in these roles and land lucrative, niche, AI jobs, here’s what you need to start doing now: Keep upskilling and make your skills niche and relevant. Focus on ways that you can provide direct financial value and translate your technical expertise to niche business solutions. This is what enterprises are looking for. Constantly update and share your portfolio on LinkedIn. Then, monetize your expertise by teaching it online or by selling your projects. Finally, learn how to make your skills marketable so that you can catch the attention of employers and high-caliber clients.

Δ Those cuts could include up to 15% of the tech giant’s human resources (HR) staff, Fortune reported late Tuesday (Oct. 14), citing multiple sources familiar with the plans. Aside from HR, other areas of the company’s consumer business are also likely to be affected, two of the sources said. The Fortune report notes that the cuts are happening at a time when Amazon is seeking ways to reduce employee costs while spending heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) products and infrastructure for in-house use and as an enterprise offering. Amazon has said it aims to spend more than $100 billion in capital expenditures this year, as it expands its cloud and AI datacenters. This follows a series of layoffs in other parts of the company earlier this year, including consumer devices unit, the Wondery podcast arm, and in Amazon Web Services (AWS). At the time, Amazon noted that it was still hiring throughout the company, including AWS roles. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue While those layoffs came soon after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that artificial intelligence (AI) would lead to job cuts, the company stressed to PYMNTS at the time that these cuts were not connected to AI, but instead followed a review of areas that could be streamlined. PYMNTS has reached out to Amazon for comment about this latest round of cuts, but has not yet gotten a reply. Jassy in June sent a message to Amazon workers saying that employees who have learned to use AI will be in a better position to be a part of the company. He added that Amazon’s corporate workforce would likely shrink in the next few years as the company embraces AI, calling it the most transformative technology since the advent of the internet. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” Jassy said in the message. Research from PYMNTS Intelligence, from the report “Workers Say Fears About GenAI Taking Their Jobs Is Overblown,” found that more than half (54%) of workers said that generative AI posed a “significant risk of widespread job displacement.” The study also found that 38% of workers said they were worried the technology could eventually lead to their jobs being eliminated.

Title: Reasons Behind Microsoft's Recent 40% Stock Surge

Time Published: 2025-10-15T10:14:55Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From a quantitative perspective, the 40.1% fluctuation in Microsoft (MSFT) stock between 4/17/2025 and 10/14/2025 can be largely attributed to a 27.5% variation in the company's P/E Multiple. Although there is more to this narrative than mere figures, let’s first analyze the stock price trends and their influencing factors. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is considerable advantage to a more diversified strategy, such as the one we take with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you invest in one stock that appeals to you, or should you create a portfolio that is structured to succeed throughout market cycles? Our analyses indicate that the High Quality Portfolio has transformed the uncertainty of stock selection into reliable market-outperforming results. This portfolio is part of the asset allocation framework of Empirical Asset Management – a Boston-based wealth management firm and Trefis collaborator – whose asset allocation strategy achieved positive returns during the 2008-09 crisis when the S&P 500 plummeted by over 40%. Returning to the "change": The shifts in fundamental aspects such as valuation, revenue, and profit margins reflect underlying business dynamics and investor sentiment. Below, we outline the key factors that affected the stock price movements for MSFT. For context, MSFT provides software, services, devices, and solutions, including Office, Microsoft Teams, Windows OEM licensing, and productivity tools to meet both business and personal computing demands. Opinion: At present, we view MSFT stock as relatively overpriced. Why is that the case? Investigate the complete narrative. Read Buy or Sell MSFT Stock to understand the factors influencing our current viewpoint. Risk: Nonetheless, Microsoft is not immune to significant declines. It experienced a drop of approximately 65% during the Dot-Com bubble and nearly 58% in the Global Financial Crisis. Recent shocks have also led to considerable declines — around 37% in the inflation spike and nearly 28% amid the Covid sell-off. The lesser correction in 2018 still resulted in a fall of over 18%. Strong fundamentals are essential, but when the market undergoes severe sell-offs, even leading stocks like MSFT can be caught in the downturn. Consistently identifying winners is a challenging endeavor — particularly given the volatility that comes with an individual stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising of 30 stocks, has a proven history of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 throughout the last four years. Why does that happen? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; it’s been less of a roller-coaster experience, as illustrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

I got the call a little before 5 p.m. on a Friday. My wife, Sima, and I were sitting on the couch with our kids, probably watching Curious George. The White House vetting process had gone on for months. Yet, despite the Zooms and document requests and endless online forms, I had a strange certainty that I ultimately would not be selected. “You’ve said … a lot of stuff,” observed the twentysomething staffer who got my file. The end of the day Friday is when Washington takes out the trash. It’s when you push out the bad news so it’s old news by Monday’s news cycle. So when the call came in, I looked at my phone, looked at Sima, and dismissively said as I stood to take the call something like: “Ah. This is the White House saying they’re not picking me.” Indeed, until the precise moment the words came out of the phone—“President Biden is going to nominate you to the Federal Trade Commission on Monday”—I remained convinced it was never going to happen. But it did. By that point, in September 2021, I’d spent most of my career working for two causes: privacy and immigrant rights. I stood up the Senate privacy subcommittee for Senator Al Franken and organized oversight hearings into Google and Apple and Facebook and the National Security Agency. I started the D.C. area’s first college scholarship that was blind to immigration status. As a law professor, I built a team that figured out how Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, finds people it wants to deport by pooling and mining their gas, water, and electric bills. I also served on the board of CASA, an extraordinary immigrant rights group that calls Kilmar Ábrego García a dues-paying member. I denounced the Trump administration’s decision to separate parents from their children at the border. I called ICE an “out of control domestic surveillance agency.” I even called the president a racist on social media. I got confirmed by the skin of my crooked teeth. It didn’t matter that I had deep experience on privacy—a core issue in the FTC’s consumer protection work. No Republican voted for me in the Senate Commerce Committee. No Republican voted for me on the floor of the Senate either. Vice President Kamala Harris had to travel to the Capitol to cast a tie-breaking vote in my favor—three times. One Republican senator told me why. We’d just had a long conversation about what social media was doing to teenagers’ mental health, and what I wanted to do about it. “I like you,” he said. “I look forward to working with you. But I can’t vote for you because of what you said about the president.” I came into office an unabashed advocate for immigrants. I left office the same way. But while that hasn’t changed, after three years as a commissioner, the way I look at the world has. I used to think that the defining fight for our country was between the left and the right. Now, I am much more worried about the money at the top crushing everyone underneath. That sounds grim because it is. But I also think this perspective can unite our country in a way that feels almost impossible today. When you are confirmed to the FTC, after you get your badge and keys and figure out your computer, the conference invitations start chiming in your inbox: Aspen, Brussels, Vegas, Davos. I declined those invites. My first trip was to Charleston, West Virginia. I had spent a lot of time during my confirmation process trying to teach myself about the pharmaceutical supply chain, and the way it affected pharmacies in rural and urban America. Along the way, I spent some time on the phone with Lynne Fruth, the second-generation owner of an independent pharmacy chain in Appalachia. She told me about how insurance companies were using intermediaries called “pharmacy benefit managers” to systematically steer lucrative prescriptions to their own mail-order pharmacies—not the ones that were convenient for their patients. I later read a West Virginia state insurance commissioner’s report about a family who had almost been turned away from a local pharmacy. Their child was sick with cancer. The pharmacy had the right medicine in stock. But an insurance company middleman told them to go home and wait up to two weeks for the medicine to arrive in the mail. So one night, after feeding the kids dinner, I got in my car and drove out to meet Fruth. As I left my house in Rockville, I turned on a podcast whose sole purpose was to explain the acronym soup of pharmaceutical pricing: “WAC,” “MAC,” “NADAC.” It got me well past Harper’s Ferry—more than an hour away. The next morning, in an office park just outside of Charleston, a roomful of independent pharmacists told me about the bizarre “negotiations” with those middlemen. Any wins were made on the phone. But the middlemen could undo those concessions at any time via fax. The pharmacists described being “audited” by those middlemen. Somehow, they were always fined by those same middlemen for noncompliance. And now, drug reimbursements from those insurers were going through the floor. In the pandemic, those independent pharmacists had vaccinated thousands of people, often in the poorest and most isolated areas unserved by national pharmacy chains. Their customers had heard all sorts of things about the vaccine online or on television. But they trusted their local pharmacists. Now, those independent pharmacies were closing, one after another. One pharmacist said, with a sad laugh, that he had started selling Jack Daniel’s just to keep the lights on. Toward the end of our session, a retired accountant named Jim Rossi started to speak. He had joined the meeting at Fruth’s request. He ticked through his daily routine of 15 pills for nine medicines treating three autoimmune disorders and a heart condition that required a pacemaker. He then told me what it was like to get all that via mail-order pharmacy. “It takes about a week to resolve any kind of a small issue with them,” he said. “Then, it takes them another week to fill the prescription. Then after that additional week wait, they ship the medication to me.” That took another three days to a week. His specialist had warned him to stick with the same manufacturer for each prescription. That’s not what came in the mail. “I open up the bottle, and there are three different colors of pills in it, which tells me there’s three different manufacturers in that bottle.” But there was one drug, for his Crohn’s disease, that the mail-order pharmacy filled unfailingly fast and in advance. He sometimes had a nine-month supply in a drawer at home. That one cost $1,000 a month. My second trip on the job was to Des Moines, where I met with nine corn growers and cattlemen in a hotel conference room on the sidelines of a law enforcement conference. The session was organized by my adviser, Max Miller, who had just left a job as an Iowa assistant attorney general to join my staff. This was the meat and potatoes of Max’s practice. I felt out of place in a suit and an N-95 mask. That went away when they started talking. Every person described a situation in which corporate power was squeezing them. They used to have any number of vendors to buy their seeds from; now there were two. The suppliers of all their inputs—feed, fertilizer, pesticides, you name it—had slowly consolidated and were jacking up prices. The ag industry was known for relentless innovation. “We doubled our yields in a generation,” the farmers said. But now, the companies weren’t focused on research and development. “They’re using their wealth to buy their competitors,” they said. The ranchers used to have any number of places to process their cattle. Now, a lot of them had just one meatpacking plant accessible to them. When you have just one place to sell your livestock, no one competes to buy it. What the processor pays is what you get. They used to fix their own tractors. Now, John Deere locked down its software, forcing them to take those tractors to a company dealership. “It’s like getting picked apart by a chicken,” said one of them. Said another: “We have a noose around our necks, and we’re standing on an ice cube.” But the problem went beyond income. When there’s just one processor, you have to get to that processor regardless of how far it is. Cattle die in the heat of the drive. And when that processor closes—as many did during Covid—there’s nowhere else to take your livestock. One rancher had to gas his hogs, dig ditches, and hire high schoolers “to fill holes with dead hogs.” Another rancher told me about how his one processor treated his animals. A cow had slipped upon arrival at the lot. She was injured and could not regain her footing. The rancher begged staff to let him take her home to heal, but that request was denied. No livestock could leave the premises. She was attached to a log chain, dragged out of the trailer, killed with a bolt to the head, and thrown in a dumpster. One of the last places I visited as a commissioner was a community center in a small park in Miami’s Little Havana. It was after sunset in early April, but it was already 80 degrees and muggy. Amid the sounds of creaking swings and little kids cutting their bikes through the playground, a dozen men trickled into the room after finishing construction and landscaping shifts in the Miami region, home to Jeff Bezos, billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, and over a hundred centimillionaires. Most of them were in their twenties and thirties. They wore baseball caps and crisp T-shirts. They looked like they had gone home, showered, and walked into the room a few moments later. They were tired. I expected their main problem to be that they didn’t get unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, or overtime. And I was right to a point. They didn’t. Even though they showed up at work and did what they were told, how they were told, and when they were told to do it, their bosses deemed them “independent contractors”—independent business owners, not W-2 employees. (I later heard an interview with an organizer who said he met workers who didn’t even know what overtime was—they’d never heard of it. “No saben que cosa es ‘overtime,’” he said.) But that wasn’t their main complaint. Their main complaint was that they didn’t get water. I did not expect that. “Maybe there’s a thermos that’s filled with water that’s not potable,” said an organizer from WeCount!, the group that called the meeting. “Maybe there’s a thermos that’s covered in mold.” One of the men worked for hours in over 100-degree heat while staring at a cooler—his only source of bottled water. The cooler was locked. The prior year, a 47-year-old worker had died while remodeling a multimillion-dollar home in Coral Gables. The heat index was 104. A Tampa Bay Times investigation found that 37 outdoor workers died from heat-related causes in Florida over the past decade, “some just hundreds of feet from air conditioning and running water.” Federal safety inspectors were nowhere to be found. “There’s no water. There’s no harness training. We’ll go a month without the most minimum contact with OSHA”—the Occupational Safety and Health Administration—said a painter named Ronny. What if he complained to his employer? Most of the workers were undocumented, Ronny explained. “When you ask for the law, you lose your job.” So, the workers had gone to the county commission, and they succeeded in securing the passage of a law mandating water breaks for local construction sites. Six days after we met, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis blocked the ordinance. My second-to-last trip was to New York City, where I met with rideshare drivers gathered in a lecture hall at Fordham Law School near Lincoln Center. There were about 20 or 25 of them. They described being lured by promises of lucrative earnings accompanied by near-total control of their schedules. Many of them invested tens of thousands of dollars in new vehicles so they could get the best fares. A lot of them had a good experience; some had had it good for years. But recently, the apps started locking them out at seemingly random times of day. The first driver I heard from was named Mohamed Mohamed. He had maintained a five-star rating and a 100 percent acceptance rate over 21,000 rides and nine years of driving. At the start, he liked that the companies called him a “partner.” “You’re a partner for us,” he recalled them telling him. Now, “I take three trips, I stop to go to the bathroom, and I’m locked out for the end of the day,” he said. He was in $2,000 of credit card debt. And he now had to drive 12 hours to earn what he previously earned in four. Then another driver sat down to speak. I didn’t catch his name; I noticed he was shaking. His wife had died unexpectedly that morning. But he had been inexplicably kicked off the apps altogether with no explanation. He showed up anyway, because someone in government was finally going to listen to him. “This is not fair,” he yelled. “And I need the account back on to go to work. Because the city provided me a license to work, to be a good citizen. I am.” He was crying. “I do everything. Pandemic, I work. Snow, I work. Why I cannot live like a decent people?” The despair in this country is far deeper than most of us understand. It’s worse than that, actually: It’s so pervasive that we don’t even see it. It’s become normal. In the wealthiest country on Earth, it’s normal for people who are diagnosed with cancer to set up a web page to beg their friends and family for money. It’s normal for those people to go bankrupt. Getting sick is the most normal reason to go bankrupt. In a country that celebrates farmers, it’s normal for those farmers to kill themselves at a rate far beyond the rest of the population. At a time when billionaires compete to launch rockets into space, it’s normal—completely normal—for construction workers to die of heat and thirst. Many liberals remain baffled that America elected Donald Trump. They genuinely have no idea how he could have won the election. I don’t think that Trump won because of “wokeism” or the “trans agenda,” whatever that is. I think he won by speaking to that despair and telling people that he alone could fix it. His tirades against China and “illegals”? Some people listened to them and heard bigotry and xenophobia. I heard it, too. But more people heard a guy talking about how he was going to help them make rent. At least enough people to win the election. My time as a commissioner changed the way I saw things. I always suspected that despite Trump’s promises to cap credit card fees and slash prices and bring manufacturing back home, all of it would more or less amount to nothing. So far, other than temporarily reducing taxes on tips, that’s pretty much what’s happened. Instead, we face looming health care and childcare cuts for millions, a slowdown in manufacturing, and on-again-off-again tariffs indexed to whether a country will nominate Donald Trump for a Nobel Prize. Chaos and cruelty don’t pay the rent. But I expected all that. What I did not expect was that over time, people I’d seen as bold progressives started to look quite different. I always thought of Colorado Governor Jared Polis as a pathbreaker: the first openly gay man and first Jewish person elected governor in the state. Now, all I can think about is how he vetoed a law that would make it dramatically easier for people in Colorado to form a union … and a law that would have barred landlords from using algorithms to collude on rent hikes … and a law, passed unanimously in the state legislature, to end surprise ambulance bills … in two weeks. I always liked how Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stood up for the little guy: for undocumented people, for trans kids. I love how he seems genuinely unafraid of this president. But it’s harder to see him in the same light after watching him veto a bill that would have protected workers at Amazon warehouses—where injuries are so frequent that the company puts vending machines on its warehouse floors that dispense not potato chips, but painkillers. Why can’t Pritzker fight for the people in warehousing? Perhaps my biggest change is in how I think about what’s happening with ICE. The masked police, the flash renditions, the swamp gulag—we now live in the dystopia that we were loudly warned about during the president’s first term. But when I see police tackle a teenager with a baby’s teething toy in her hand, when I see them peel a child off of her dad’s arm at the courthouse, or cuff a shrieking mother saying she needs to get her kids from school, my first thought is not to “immigrant rights.” No. Now, I can’t stop thinking about the lawyer in a hand-stitched suit sitting at my old FTC conference table, telling me, over 70 minutes and a 30-page PowerPoint, how it could not possibly be in the interest of the United States government to sue her corporate client. And I’m not talking about one particular case; I’m talking about all of them. When the federal government does things like investigate a corporate landlord for packing rent checks with fake charges, or an oil executive allegedly trying to “align U.S. oil production with OPEC,” or pharmacy middlemen accused of trying to raise the price of insulin—it’s sternly worded letters, PDF white papers, and multiple hour-long meetings where the company gets to tell us what we got wrong. That’s standard process. But when you’re a cleaning lady whose papers aren’t right? It’s five men in bulletproof vests on your doorstep, and your four-year-old crumpled in your arms begging “no quiero please, please, please.” It’s an agent saying, “I’m sorry, but I don’t have any choice.” And that difference enrages me. Soon after taking office, Trump’s designated chairman of the FTC, Andrew Ferguson, announced that the agency would “usher in a new Golden Age for American businesses, workers, and consumers.” What has followed has been a Golden Age for the C-suite. The ban on noncompete clauses that keep everyone from pediatric surgeons to Jimmy John’s sandwich-makers in dead-end positions, or keep them from working entirely? Not worth defending in court. The rule banning companies from doing that thing where they sign you up for a subscription online, but only let you unsubscribe over the phone? Enforcement delayed to mid-July to give companies “ample time” to comply … and the federal court a window to strike it down. The order barring that oil executive from the board of Exxon? Undone. He’s free and clear to join. A similar scene unfolded 10 blocks west at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bank that was systematically hitting service members with surprise overdraft fees and forced to send them $80 million in refunds? Don’t have to pay them back anymore. The lawsuit against a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary that allegedly tricked people into taking out loans for mobile homes when they had $57.78 in discretionary income? Gone. As everyone knows, these are just the lowlights. What people may not know is how thoroughly unprepared we are for this reality. Picture the inauguration. If the president tries to illegally deport you or illegally strip you of your voting rights or (ahem) illegally fire you, there are dozens of nonprofits that can step up to defend you in court, free of cost. Many struggle to make payroll. Some have tens of millions of dollars in the bank. The American Civil Liberties Union has $829 million. But what if the billionaires over the president’s shoulder hurt you? If they use legal loopholes to deny you health care? If they dock or block your pay for no apparent reason? If they buy all of your buyers so that only they buy your goods, and they set the price? If they use their market power not to outcompete you, but to bully you out of the market? There are maybe a handful of national nonprofit organizations that will represent you pro bono. And the ACLU fights the government, not the oligarchs. This all-encompassing focus on fighting government overreach may have made sense when our tax system actually taxed the rich, when union membership was at an all-time high, and when CEO earnings were not a vulgarity. Now, Fortune 500 firms regularly pay zero dollars in taxes. Unions protect just one in 10 workers. And CEOs parade like modern-day Roman emperors, in private jets, to private islands, with their private Praetorian firefighters and guards. And all of this is happening when the government agencies built to check corporate power are being torn apart. My daughter likes me to watch her gymnastics class. Let me try that again. My daughter really doesn’t like it when I stare at my phone during her gymnastics class. She has her mother’s strength. So when she makes it around the uneven bars a little faster than her peers, the first thing she does is shoot me a look. If I’m looking at my phone, that’s a big “L” for dad. And so, on a Tuesday this March, when I got a call a few moments after arriving at the gym from my colleague, Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, asking, “Hey, have you checked your email?”—I proudly said I had not! “Well, I just got an email from the White House saying they were firing me. You should probably check yours.” Sure enough, I had an email from someone named Trent Morse informing me that the president was firing me, effective immediately. Curiously, Morse did not claim I had neglected my duties or misused my authority; he went out of his way to not give a reason for the firing. That was a problem—for them. Because the Supreme Court had said, 90 years earlier, that the president could only remove an FTC commissioner “for cause.” The court said that unanimously. Suddenly, we had to answer a really weird question really quickly: If the president says you’re fired, but the Supreme Court says he can’t fire you, did you get fired? Or did you not get fired? Becca and I decided we did not get fired. We would keep doing our jobs. We’d keep on taking meetings, issuing statements, testifying before Congress. And we thought we should be loud about it. I called Sima, and my chief of staff. Then I put out a statement saying that the president was trying to turn the FTC, a fierce corporate watchdog, into “a lapdog for his golfing buddies.” The calls started. The New York Times, Bloomberg, a producer for Chris Hayes. My daughter got out of class, and I told her I’d been fired. She gave me a hug, got in the car, and asked if she could watch her favorite Lego builder on YouTube. FTC staff started calling. Then, more reporters. Ten minutes into the drive home, a little voice in the back seat piped up, “Papa, why are we going this way?” I was missing turns from the notifications on my screen, then missing more turns when my phone, which kept on dinging, was slow to update the map. When we finally got home, I recorded a video to explain how this wasn’t about hurting me, but about helping the men at the inauguration—Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Pichai. Between the two of us, Becca and I had sued, or were actively suing, each of the men’s companies. And we were weeks from a federal trial against Meta. We did a virtual press conference with some senators and congressmen; I did more interviews after that. A little before midnight, there was a knock at our door. Domino’s. It was my first break since 5 p.m., and I was grateful for what I thought was a gesture from a friend who knew I’d be up late. I opened the box: meat lover’s, loaded with bacon. We don’t do bacon. I asked the delivery guy if he’d gotten a tip—he said no—so I started trying to find an app to pay him, when he spoke up to say, “Well, ah, sir, you still haven’t paid for the pizza.” That’s when we realized that the pizza was not from a friend. It was from someone, somewhere, telling me they knew where I lived. The days and weeks ping-ponged between the thrill of being able to publicly denounce what was happening to our agency—and the dull fear a parent feels when things are not right for their family. I hold virtual roundtables with rideshare drivers in Denver, fishermen from Maine, and small retailers in Massachusetts—someone tries to take out a half-million-dollar line of credit in my name. I speak at the Bernie and AOC rally in Denver; I scream so loud I pull a muscle in my neck. I realize we can’t buy a house on a single income, even though we’d been planning a move for months. Commissioner Slaughter and I quickly sued to block the attempt to remove us. The financial ramifications of the legal fight started to set in. Sima and I looked at our accounts and figured we could afford about three months for it to play out. The three-month mark approached with no ruling from the judge. So I decided to call the guys in Iowa. My very last visit as a commissioner was to a family farm in Ankeny, just north of Des Moines. It was scheduled for a Saturday morning in June. Going in, I knew that by Monday, unless I woke up to a ruling reinstating me, I’d issue a statement formally resigning as a commissioner, letting me start to look for a new job. Max, my former adviser, put me up at his house the night before. We woke up and went to the farmer’s market with his new wife and their now five kids. I got a coffee and a kielbasa. We drove up to Ankeny. The Iowa Farmers Union had organized a listening session at a fifth-generation diversified farm that grew corn, soybeans, oats, and alfalfa, along with a range of livestock. The owner, LaVon Griffieon, had attended that first meeting; so had a few others in the audience. This time, I was able to talk about our lawsuit against two pesticides manufacturers that were trying to push cheaper generics off the market, as well as about our lawsuit, filed just that January, against John Deere for locking down its software. The group was kind to me. They appreciated it, they said. But so many of their stories were the same that they were three years earlier. A corn and soybean grower said that fertilizer prices were moving in lockstep, such that the moment the farmers finally saw some profit, prices would go up and erase those profits. “Iowans like to claim they feed the world,” said Griffieon. “But the pandemic proved to us with bare store shelves that Iowa can’t even feed Iowa very easily.” A half-hour in, there was a speaker I hadn’t met—a tall, young farmer with long hair, also fifth-generation, named Sean Dengler. On the first day of the winter harvest, he had gotten up and turned on the combine. It roared, then whimpered, then went into “limp mode.” The circuit board was fried, and only John Deere could fix it. Sean’s father called the dealership right away, but the technician took hours to get there. A line of other farmers had called in first. The soybeans were already dry, and it was hot and windy. So they paid extra for the part to be delivered the next day; and again paid extra for the second visit. “We lost time waiting, which meant lost yield potential,” he said. “And we lost money because John Deere could charge us more because that is their business plan.” Our lawsuit was a few months too late. It was Sean’s last harvest. “Both of my grandparents were farmers,” he said. “I’m the last Dengler to ever farm in Tama County.” The session lasted another hour. I had lunch at a Mexican restaurant with the union president, his vice president, an ag reporter, and Josh Manske, a board member from Algona, Iowa. The lunch lasted about an hour. And that was it. I was done. Josh and I met Max in a park back in Des Moines, got some beers, and found an empty picnic table. We talked about Max’s blended family. I thanked Josh for hosting a liminal FTC commissioner. We laughed about that. We talked about the session. While a lot of things had come up, I kept coming back to Sean Dengler. Then, I thought about those rideshare drivers in New York City. It may not look this way at first, but the Iowa farmer who can’t run his combine because of a farm equipment monopoly has a heck of a lot in common with the Bangladeshi dad who can’t work the morning commute because he’s locked out by Uber and Lyft. If you focus on the conflict between left and right, if the most important thing is what you are—your party, your state, your race, your ethnicity—the people I met could not be more different. On the one hand, you have rural, white small-business owners, generations into building a life in this country. On the other, you have urban Latino, Haitian, African, and South Asian immigrants, every one of them a worker. The line between them is sharp, almost tribal. What could they possibly have in common? Everything—if you look at what they need. The people I met as a commissioner may look different, but what they need is surprisingly the same: They need a government that gives them a level playing field against the powerful and wealthy. They need the courts to check corporations when they abuse that power and wealth. They need basic dignity and control in their material lives. Looking at things that way, everyone I met was part of one huge group: people working themselves to the bone who were getting screwed by billionaires and corporations—regardless of party or state or race or ethnicity. Regardless, even, of whether they are workers or the owners of farms or small businesses. Populism is not an indictment, but an opportunity. Focusing on the conflict between the haves and the have-nots is not divisive; it’s a way to build coalitions with astonishing potential. Our nation’s first antitrust law was passed at the demand of small farmers bled dry by the railroads and grain elevators. But when Ohio’s John Sherman stood on the floor of the Senate to call for its passage in 1890, he didn’t just do it for the Grangers. He also talked about labor. The trust “commands the price of labor without fear of strikes,” he declared, “for in its field it allows no competitors.” When the law was abused to crack down on strikers, Samuel Gompers mobilized the American Federation of Labor and won corrections in the 1914 Clayton Act to try to guarantee them that right, while tightening other loopholes that John Rockefeller and the other robber barons had exploited. Gompers called the law a “Magna Carta for labor.” Then in 1936, small-town grocers came in to press for and win a separate law to stop the incipient A&P grocery chain—ancestor of the modern big-box stores—from cutting secret deals with their suppliers that slashed prices for A&P while marking them up for the little guys. Our anti-monopoly laws exist because of the work of farmers, labor unions, and country grocers. If that seems like an unlikely bunch, consider that Minnesota still does not have a “Democratic” party, but rather a Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, because of a resurgence of that coalition 30 years after the Sherman Act. Consider that the pharmacy deserts in Appalachia are caused by the same ruthless middlemen who create those deserts in Philadelphia. I know, because a session I had with the Philadelphia pharmacists was nearly identical to one I’d had in Charleston. The same goes for independent grocers. The people in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, live in an incipient food desert for the same reason that the people of downtown North Tulsa do: The government stopped enforcing the 1936 law (it was called the Robinson-Patman Act). And when we start enforcing it again, poor people in small towns and big cities—people told every day that they have nothing in common—will benefit in equal measure. I feel the potential for those fights anytime I hear how some conservatives talk about the tenure of Lina Khan, whom I served alongside when she was chair of the Federal Trade Commission. I felt it when I talked to people about my job. I had a favorite kind of conversation as a commissioner. I had some version of it at least three or four times. It was when a MAGA conservative asked me—a certified “left-wing activist,” “provocateur,” “bomb-thrower,” and “extremist”—to quote my friend Ted Cruz: What exactly is it you do in government? I would tell anyone who asked that I was investigating the pharmacy middlemen who were shutting down independent pharmacies across rural and urban America. I’d tell them I was suing Amazon for screwing over small retailers. I’d tell them I was making sure that the biggest grocery store in town doesn’t buy the next biggest grocery store in town—which will make eggs even more expensive and union negotiations even harder. I’d tell them I was trying to let gig workers organize so that Uber and Lyft and DoorDash couldn’t lie to them or cheat them out of their pay. I’d tell them I was suing landlords who pack rent bills with hidden fees. I definitely told them that we were trying to end that horrible thing where you sign up for something online but can only cancel on the phone before 4 p.m., after 45 minutes on hold. And usually, by that point, the conversation had changed. Their suspicion had turned into cautious interest, maybe even excitement. Undocumented people have become the new American underclass: good enough to pick our crops, bus our tables, and build our buildings—not good enough for us to protect their life or liberty, let alone their pursuit of happiness. There are many reasons for this. Some are legal. A lot of it is anger. I understand where some of the anger comes from. Take the construction industry. A generation of working-class kids grew up watching their dads provide for their families by working construction. They were hard jobs, but they were good ones. You could buy a house, send your kid to college, maybe even buy a boat for the weekends. Now, those jobs pay a fraction of what they used to. And those kids are now adults, voting adults, and they see those jobs occupied by men from Central and South America, many of whom are undocumented. What would it look like to confront undocumented immigration not as a left-right issue, but as a conflict between billionaires and working people? Maybe we focus less on the tension between undocumented people and the native-born workers that they seem to displace. Maybe we focus more on the billionaire developers who pretended that the people they hired were “independent contractors,” turning what used to be middle-class jobs into subsistence work, while also making it easier to hire and exploit undocumented laborers. Maybe we ask ourselves: Who gets rich from that? Is it the guy working in 100-degree heat with no water? Or is it the guy downing a steak while toasting his new development? Maybe we try to become skeptical of the idea that the least powerful people are the most responsible for our problems. Maybe we punch up instead of punching the neighbor. Nowadays, I think a lot about what’s happened to Ábrego García. The media has rightly focused on the outpouring of support for an apprentice sheet metal worker and his young family in Beltsville, Maryland. They are right to focus on the courthouse protests. They made a difference. But I have been moved by a different scene, which occurred in early April in a Washington, D.C., conference hall filled with electricians, ironworkers, and other tradespeople, members of the North America’s Building Trades Unions, where Ábrego García’s union is an affiliate. In this scene, NABTU president Sean McGarvey stands in front of his members, and says: We need to make our voices heard. We’re not red, we’re not blue. We’re the building trades, the backbone of America. You want to build a $5 billion data center? Want more six-figure careers with health care, retirement, and no college debt? You don’t call Elon Musk. You call us! [...] And yeah, that means all of us—all of us! Including our brother, SMART apprentice Kilmar Ábrego García, who we demand to be returned to us and his family now. He slams his fist on the podium. “Bring him home!” he shouts, as the audience gets out of their seats for a standing ovation. And that, to me, feels like the future. Alvaro M. Bedoya served as a federal trade commissioner from 2022 until President Trump fired him in March.

I got the call a little before 5 p.m. on a Friday. My wife, Sima, and I were sitting on the couch with our kids, probably watching Curious George. The White House vetting process had gone on for months. Yet, despite the Zooms and document requests and endless online forms, I had a strange certainty that I ultimately would not be selected. “You’ve said … a lot of stuff,” observed the twentysomething staffer who got my file. The end of the day Friday is when Washington takes out the trash. It’s when you push out the bad news so it’s old news by Monday’s news cycle. So when the call came in, I looked at my phone, looked at Sima, and dismissively said as I stood to take the call something like: “Ah. This is the White House saying they’re not picking me.” Indeed, until the precise moment the words came out of the phone—“President Biden is going to nominate you to the Federal Trade Commission on Monday”—I remained convinced it was never going to happen. But it did. By that point, in September 2021, I’d spent most of my career working for two causes: privacy and immigrant rights. I stood up the Senate privacy subcommittee for Senator Al Franken and organized oversight hearings into Google and Apple and Facebook and the National Security Agency. I started the D.C. area’s first college scholarship that was blind to immigration status. As a law professor, I built a team that figured out how Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, finds people it wants to deport by pooling and mining their gas, water, and electric bills. I also served on the board of CASA, an extraordinary immigrant rights group that calls Kilmar Ábrego García a dues-paying member. I denounced the Trump administration’s decision to separate parents from their children at the border. I called ICE an “out of control domestic surveillance agency.” I even called the president a racist on social media. I got confirmed by the skin of my crooked teeth. It didn’t matter that I had deep experience on privacy—a core issue in the FTC’s consumer protection work. No Republican voted for me in the Senate Commerce Committee. No Republican voted for me on the floor of the Senate either. Vice President Kamala Harris had to travel to the Capitol to cast a tie-breaking vote in my favor—three times. One Republican senator told me why. We’d just had a long conversation about what social media was doing to teenagers’ mental health, and what I wanted to do about it. “I like you,” he said. “I look forward to working with you. But I can’t vote for you because of what you said about the president.” I came into office an unabashed advocate for immigrants. I left office the same way. But while that hasn’t changed, after three years as a commissioner, the way I look at the world has. I used to think that the defining fight for our country was between the left and the right. Now, I am much more worried about the money at the top crushing everyone underneath. That sounds grim because it is. But I also think this perspective can unite our country in a way that feels almost impossible today. When you are confirmed to the FTC, after you get your badge and keys and figure out your computer, the conference invitations start chiming in your inbox: Aspen, Brussels, Vegas, Davos. I declined those invites. My first trip was to Charleston, West Virginia. I had spent a lot of time during my confirmation process trying to teach myself about the pharmaceutical supply chain, and the way it affected pharmacies in rural and urban America. Along the way, I spent some time on the phone with Lynne Fruth, the second-generation owner of an independent pharmacy chain in Appalachia. She told me about how insurance companies were using intermediaries called “pharmacy benefit managers” to systematically steer lucrative prescriptions to their own mail-order pharmacies—not the ones that were convenient for their patients. I later read a West Virginia state insurance commissioner’s report about a family who had almost been turned away from a local pharmacy. Their child was sick with cancer. The pharmacy had the right medicine in stock. But an insurance company middleman told them to go home and wait up to two weeks for the medicine to arrive in the mail. So one night, after feeding the kids dinner, I got in my car and drove out to meet Fruth. As I left my house in Rockville, I turned on a podcast whose sole purpose was to explain the acronym soup of pharmaceutical pricing: “WAC,” “MAC,” “NADAC.” It got me well past Harper’s Ferry—more than an hour away. The next morning, in an office park just outside of Charleston, a roomful of independent pharmacists told me about the bizarre “negotiations” with those middlemen. Any wins were made on the phone. But the middlemen could undo those concessions at any time via fax. The pharmacists described being “audited” by those middlemen. Somehow, they were always fined by those same middlemen for noncompliance. And now, drug reimbursements from those insurers were going through the floor. In the pandemic, those independent pharmacists had vaccinated thousands of people, often in the poorest and most isolated areas unserved by national pharmacy chains. Their customers had heard all sorts of things about the vaccine online or on television. But they trusted their local pharmacists. Now, those independent pharmacies were closing, one after another. One pharmacist said, with a sad laugh, that he had started selling Jack Daniel’s just to keep the lights on. Toward the end of our session, a retired accountant named Jim Rossi started to speak. He had joined the meeting at Fruth’s request. He ticked through his daily routine of 15 pills for nine medicines treating three autoimmune disorders and a heart condition that required a pacemaker. He then told me what it was like to get all that via mail-order pharmacy. “It takes about a week to resolve any kind of a small issue with them,” he said. “Then, it takes them another week to fill the prescription. Then after that additional week wait, they ship the medication to me.” That took another three days to a week. His specialist had warned him to stick with the same manufacturer for each prescription. That’s not what came in the mail. “I open up the bottle, and there are three different colors of pills in it, which tells me there’s three different manufacturers in that bottle.” But there was one drug, for his Crohn’s disease, that the mail-order pharmacy filled unfailingly fast and in advance. He sometimes had a nine-month supply in a drawer at home. That one cost $1,000 a month. My second trip on the job was to Des Moines, where I met with nine corn growers and cattlemen in a hotel conference room on the sidelines of a law enforcement conference. The session was organized by my adviser, Max Miller, who had just left a job as an Iowa assistant attorney general to join my staff. This was the meat and potatoes of Max’s practice. I felt out of place in a suit and an N-95 mask. That went away when they started talking. Every person described a situation in which corporate power was squeezing them. They used to have any number of vendors to buy their seeds from; now there were two. The suppliers of all their inputs—feed, fertilizer, pesticides, you name it—had slowly consolidated and were jacking up prices. The ag industry was known for relentless innovation. “We doubled our yields in a generation,” the farmers said. But now, the companies weren’t focused on research and development. “They’re using their wealth to buy their competitors,” they said. The ranchers used to have any number of places to process their cattle. Now, a lot of them had just one meatpacking plant accessible to them. When you have just one place to sell your livestock, no one competes to buy it. What the processor pays is what you get. They used to fix their own tractors. Now, John Deere locked down its software, forcing them to take those tractors to a company dealership. “It’s like getting picked apart by a chicken,” said one of them. Said another: “We have a noose around our necks, and we’re standing on an ice cube.” But the problem went beyond income. When there’s just one processor, you have to get to that processor regardless of how far it is. Cattle die in the heat of the drive. And when that processor closes—as many did during Covid—there’s nowhere else to take your livestock. One rancher had to gas his hogs, dig ditches, and hire high schoolers “to fill holes with dead hogs.” Another rancher told me about how his one processor treated his animals. A cow had slipped upon arrival at the lot. She was injured and could not regain her footing. The rancher begged staff to let him take her home to heal, but that request was denied. No livestock could leave the premises. She was attached to a log chain, dragged out of the trailer, killed with a bolt to the head, and thrown in a dumpster. One of the last places I visited as a commissioner was a community center in a small park in Miami’s Little Havana. It was after sunset in early April, but it was already 80 degrees and muggy. Amid the sounds of creaking swings and little kids cutting their bikes through the playground, a dozen men trickled into the room after finishing construction and landscaping shifts in the Miami region, home to Jeff Bezos, billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, and over a hundred centimillionaires. Most of them were in their twenties and thirties. They wore baseball caps and crisp T-shirts. They looked like they had gone home, showered, and walked into the room a few moments later. They were tired. I expected their main problem to be that they didn’t get unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, or overtime. And I was right to a point. They didn’t. Even though they showed up at work and did what they were told, how they were told, and when they were told to do it, their bosses deemed them “independent contractors”—independent business owners, not W-2 employees. (I later heard an interview with an organizer who said he met workers who didn’t even know what overtime was—they’d never heard of it. “No saben que cosa es ‘overtime,’” he said.) But that wasn’t their main complaint. Their main complaint was that they didn’t get water. I did not expect that. “Maybe there’s a thermos that’s filled with water that’s not potable,” said an organizer from WeCount!, the group that called the meeting. “Maybe there’s a thermos that’s covered in mold.” One of the men worked for hours in over 100-degree heat while staring at a cooler—his only source of bottled water. The cooler was locked. The prior year, a 47-year-old worker had died while remodeling a multimillion-dollar home in Coral Gables. The heat index was 104. A Tampa Bay Times investigation found that 37 outdoor workers died from heat-related causes in Florida over the past decade, “some just hundreds of feet from air conditioning and running water.” Federal safety inspectors were nowhere to be found. “There’s no water. There’s no harness training. We’ll go a month without the most minimum contact with OSHA”—the Occupational Safety and Health Administration—said a painter named Ronny. What if he complained to his employer? Most of the workers were undocumented, Ronny explained. “When you ask for the law, you lose your job.” So, the workers had gone to the county commission, and they succeeded in securing the passage of a law mandating water breaks for local construction sites. Six days after we met, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis blocked the ordinance. My second-to-last trip was to New York City, where I met with rideshare drivers gathered in a lecture hall at Fordham Law School near Lincoln Center. There were about 20 or 25 of them. They described being lured by promises of lucrative earnings accompanied by near-total control of their schedules. Many of them invested tens of thousands of dollars in new vehicles so they could get the best fares. A lot of them had a good experience; some had had it good for years. But recently, the apps started locking them out at seemingly random times of day. The first driver I heard from was named Mohamed Mohamed. He had maintained a five-star rating and a 100 percent acceptance rate over 21,000 rides and nine years of driving. At the start, he liked that the companies called him a “partner.” “You’re a partner for us,” he recalled them telling him. Now, “I take three trips, I stop to go to the bathroom, and I’m locked out for the end of the day,” he said. He was in $2,000 of credit card debt. And he now had to drive 12 hours to earn what he previously earned in four. Then another driver sat down to speak. I didn’t catch his name; I noticed he was shaking. His wife had died unexpectedly that morning. But he had been inexplicably kicked off the apps altogether with no explanation. He showed up anyway, because someone in government was finally going to listen to him. “This is not fair,” he yelled. “And I need the account back on to go to work. Because the city provided me a license to work, to be a good citizen. I am.” He was crying. “I do everything. Pandemic, I work. Snow, I work. Why I cannot live like a decent people?” The despair in this country is far deeper than most of us understand. It’s worse than that, actually: It’s so pervasive that we don’t even see it. It’s become normal. In the wealthiest country on Earth, it’s normal for people who are diagnosed with cancer to set up a web page to beg their friends and family for money. It’s normal for those people to go bankrupt. Getting sick is the most normal reason to go bankrupt. In a country that celebrates farmers, it’s normal for those farmers to kill themselves at a rate far beyond the rest of the population. At a time when billionaires compete to launch rockets into space, it’s normal—completely normal—for construction workers to die of heat and thirst. Many liberals remain baffled that America elected Donald Trump. They genuinely have no idea how he could have won the election. I don’t think that Trump won because of “wokeism” or the “trans agenda,” whatever that is. I think he won by speaking to that despair and telling people that he alone could fix it. His tirades against China and “illegals”? Some people listened to them and heard bigotry and xenophobia. I heard it, too. But more people heard a guy talking about how he was going to help them make rent. At least enough people to win the election. My time as a commissioner changed the way I saw things. I always suspected that despite Trump’s promises to cap credit card fees and slash prices and bring manufacturing back home, all of it would more or less amount to nothing. So far, other than temporarily reducing taxes on tips, that’s pretty much what’s happened. Instead, we face looming health care and childcare cuts for millions, a slowdown in manufacturing, and on-again-off-again tariffs indexed to whether a country will nominate Donald Trump for a Nobel Prize. Chaos and cruelty don’t pay the rent. But I expected all that. What I did not expect was that over time, people I’d seen as bold progressives started to look quite different. I always thought of Colorado Governor Jared Polis as a pathbreaker: the first openly gay man and first Jewish person elected governor in the state. Now, all I can think about is how he vetoed a law that would make it dramatically easier for people in Colorado to form a union … and a law that would have barred landlords from using algorithms to collude on rent hikes … and a law, passed unanimously in the state legislature, to end surprise ambulance bills … in two weeks. I always liked how Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stood up for the little guy: for undocumented people, for trans kids. I love how he seems genuinely unafraid of this president. But it’s harder to see him in the same light after watching him veto a bill that would have protected workers at Amazon warehouses—where injuries are so frequent that the company puts vending machines on its warehouse floors that dispense not potato chips, but painkillers. Why can’t Pritzker fight for the people in warehousing? Perhaps my biggest change is in how I think about what’s happening with ICE. The masked police, the flash renditions, the swamp gulag—we now live in the dystopia that we were loudly warned about during the president’s first term. But when I see police tackle a teenager with a baby’s teething toy in her hand, when I see them peel a child off of her dad’s arm at the courthouse, or cuff a shrieking mother saying she needs to get her kids from school, my first thought is not to “immigrant rights.” No. Now, I can’t stop thinking about the lawyer in a hand-stitched suit sitting at my old FTC conference table, telling me, over 70 minutes and a 30-page PowerPoint, how it could not possibly be in the interest of the United States government to sue her corporate client. And I’m not talking about one particular case; I’m talking about all of them. When the federal government does things like investigate a corporate landlord for packing rent checks with fake charges, or an oil executive allegedly trying to “align U.S. oil production with OPEC,” or pharmacy middlemen accused of trying to raise the price of insulin—it’s sternly worded letters, PDF white papers, and multiple hour-long meetings where the company gets to tell us what we got wrong. That’s standard process. But when you’re a cleaning lady whose papers aren’t right? It’s five men in bulletproof vests on your doorstep, and your four-year-old crumpled in your arms begging “no quiero please, please, please.” It’s an agent saying, “I’m sorry, but I don’t have any choice.” And that difference enrages me. Soon after taking office, Trump’s designated chairman of the FTC, Andrew Ferguson, announced that the agency would “usher in a new Golden Age for American businesses, workers, and consumers.” What has followed has been a Golden Age for the C-suite. The ban on noncompete clauses that keep everyone from pediatric surgeons to Jimmy John’s sandwich-makers in dead-end positions, or keep them from working entirely? Not worth defending in court. The rule banning companies from doing that thing where they sign you up for a subscription online, but only let you unsubscribe over the phone? Enforcement delayed to mid-July to give companies “ample time” to comply … and the federal court a window to strike it down. The order barring that oil executive from the board of Exxon? Undone. He’s free and clear to join. A similar scene unfolded 10 blocks west at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bank that was systematically hitting service members with surprise overdraft fees and forced to send them $80 million in refunds? Don’t have to pay them back anymore. The lawsuit against a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary that allegedly tricked people into taking out loans for mobile homes when they had $57.78 in discretionary income? Gone. As everyone knows, these are just the lowlights. What people may not know is how thoroughly unprepared we are for this reality. Picture the inauguration. If the president tries to illegally deport you or illegally strip you of your voting rights or (ahem) illegally fire you, there are dozens of nonprofits that can step up to defend you in court, free of cost. Many struggle to make payroll. Some have tens of millions of dollars in the bank. The American Civil Liberties Union has $829 million. But what if the billionaires over the president’s shoulder hurt you? If they use legal loopholes to deny you health care? If they dock or block your pay for no apparent reason? If they buy all of your buyers so that only they buy your goods, and they set the price? If they use their market power not to outcompete you, but to bully you out of the market? There are maybe a handful of national nonprofit organizations that will represent you pro bono. And the ACLU fights the government, not the oligarchs. This all-encompassing focus on fighting government overreach may have made sense when our tax system actually taxed the rich, when union membership was at an all-time high, and when CEO earnings were not a vulgarity. Now, Fortune 500 firms regularly pay zero dollars in taxes. Unions protect just one in 10 workers. And CEOs parade like modern-day Roman emperors, in private jets, to private islands, with their private Praetorian firefighters and guards. And all of this is happening when the government agencies built to check corporate power are being torn apart. My daughter likes me to watch her gymnastics class. Let me try that again. My daughter really doesn’t like it when I stare at my phone during her gymnastics class. She has her mother’s strength. So when she makes it around the uneven bars a little faster than her peers, the first thing she does is shoot me a look. If I’m looking at my phone, that’s a big “L” for dad. And so, on a Tuesday this March, when I got a call a few moments after arriving at the gym from my colleague, Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, asking, “Hey, have you checked your email?”—I proudly said I had not! “Well, I just got an email from the White House saying they were firing me. You should probably check yours.” Sure enough, I had an email from someone named Trent Morse informing me that the president was firing me, effective immediately. Curiously, Morse did not claim I had neglected my duties or misused my authority; he went out of his way to not give a reason for the firing. That was a problem—for them. Because the Supreme Court had said, 90 years earlier, that the president could only remove an FTC commissioner “for cause.” The court said that unanimously. Suddenly, we had to answer a really weird question really quickly: If the president says you’re fired, but the Supreme Court says he can’t fire you, did you get fired? Or did you not get fired? Becca and I decided we did not get fired. We would keep doing our jobs. We’d keep on taking meetings, issuing statements, testifying before Congress. And we thought we should be loud about it. I called Sima, and my chief of staff. Then I put out a statement saying that the president was trying to turn the FTC, a fierce corporate watchdog, into “a lapdog for his golfing buddies.” The calls started. The New York Times, Bloomberg, a producer for Chris Hayes. My daughter got out of class, and I told her I’d been fired. She gave me a hug, got in the car, and asked if she could watch her favorite Lego builder on YouTube. FTC staff started calling. Then, more reporters. Ten minutes into the drive home, a little voice in the back seat piped up, “Papa, why are we going this way?” I was missing turns from the notifications on my screen, then missing more turns when my phone, which kept on dinging, was slow to update the map. When we finally got home, I recorded a video to explain how this wasn’t about hurting me, but about helping the men at the inauguration—Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Pichai. Between the two of us, Becca and I had sued, or were actively suing, each of the men’s companies. And we were weeks from a federal trial against Meta. We did a virtual press conference with some senators and congressmen; I did more interviews after that. A little before midnight, there was a knock at our door. Domino’s. It was my first break since 5 p.m., and I was grateful for what I thought was a gesture from a friend who knew I’d be up late. I opened the box: meat lover’s, loaded with bacon. We don’t do bacon. I asked the delivery guy if he’d gotten a tip—he said no—so I started trying to find an app to pay him, when he spoke up to say, “Well, ah, sir, you still haven’t paid for the pizza.” That’s when we realized that the pizza was not from a friend. It was from someone, somewhere, telling me they knew where I lived. The days and weeks ping-ponged between the thrill of being able to publicly denounce what was happening to our agency—and the dull fear a parent feels when things are not right for their family. I hold virtual roundtables with rideshare drivers in Denver, fishermen from Maine, and small retailers in Massachusetts—someone tries to take out a half-million-dollar line of credit in my name. I speak at the Bernie and AOC rally in Denver; I scream so loud I pull a muscle in my neck. I realize we can’t buy a house on a single income, even though we’d been planning a move for months. Commissioner Slaughter and I quickly sued to block the attempt to remove us. The financial ramifications of the legal fight started to set in. Sima and I looked at our accounts and figured we could afford about three months for it to play out. The three-month mark approached with no ruling from the judge. So I decided to call the guys in Iowa. My very last visit as a commissioner was to a family farm in Ankeny, just north of Des Moines. It was scheduled for a Saturday morning in June. Going in, I knew that by Monday, unless I woke up to a ruling reinstating me, I’d issue a statement formally resigning as a commissioner, letting me start to look for a new job. Max, my former adviser, put me up at his house the night before. We woke up and went to the farmer’s market with his new wife and their now five kids. I got a coffee and a kielbasa. We drove up to Ankeny. The Iowa Farmers Union had organized a listening session at a fifth-generation diversified farm that grew corn, soybeans, oats, and alfalfa, along with a range of livestock. The owner, LaVon Griffieon, had attended that first meeting; so had a few others in the audience. This time, I was able to talk about our lawsuit against two pesticides manufacturers that were trying to push cheaper generics off the market, as well as about our lawsuit, filed just that January, against John Deere for locking down its software. The group was kind to me. They appreciated it, they said. But so many of their stories were the same that they were three years earlier. A corn and soybean grower said that fertilizer prices were moving in lockstep, such that the moment the farmers finally saw some profit, prices would go up and erase those profits. “Iowans like to claim they feed the world,” said Griffieon. “But the pandemic proved to us with bare store shelves that Iowa can’t even feed Iowa very easily.” A half-hour in, there was a speaker I hadn’t met—a tall, young farmer with long hair, also fifth-generation, named Sean Dengler. On the first day of the winter harvest, he had gotten up and turned on the combine. It roared, then whimpered, then went into “limp mode.” The circuit board was fried, and only John Deere could fix it. Sean’s father called the dealership right away, but the technician took hours to get there. A line of other farmers had called in first. The soybeans were already dry, and it was hot and windy. So they paid extra for the part to be delivered the next day; and again paid extra for the second visit. “We lost time waiting, which meant lost yield potential,” he said. “And we lost money because John Deere could charge us more because that is their business plan.” Our lawsuit was a few months too late. It was Sean’s last harvest. “Both of my grandparents were farmers,” he said. “I’m the last Dengler to ever farm in Tama County.” The session lasted another hour. I had lunch at a Mexican restaurant with the union president, his vice president, an ag reporter, and Josh Manske, a board member from Algona, Iowa. The lunch lasted about an hour. And that was it. I was done. Josh and I met Max in a park back in Des Moines, got some beers, and found an empty picnic table. We talked about Max’s blended family. I thanked Josh for hosting a liminal FTC commissioner. We laughed about that. We talked about the session. While a lot of things had come up, I kept coming back to Sean Dengler. Then, I thought about those rideshare drivers in New York City. It may not look this way at first, but the Iowa farmer who can’t run his combine because of a farm equipment monopoly has a heck of a lot in common with the Bangladeshi dad who can’t work the morning commute because he’s locked out by Uber and Lyft. If you focus on the conflict between left and right, if the most important thing is what you are—your party, your state, your race, your ethnicity—the people I met could not be more different. On the one hand, you have rural, white small-business owners, generations into building a life in this country. On the other, you have urban Latino, Haitian, African, and South Asian immigrants, every one of them a worker. The line between them is sharp, almost tribal. What could they possibly have in common? Everything—if you look at what they need. The people I met as a commissioner may look different, but what they need is surprisingly the same: They need a government that gives them a level playing field against the powerful and wealthy. They need the courts to check corporations when they abuse that power and wealth. They need basic dignity and control in their material lives. Looking at things that way, everyone I met was part of one huge group: people working themselves to the bone who were getting screwed by billionaires and corporations—regardless of party or state or race or ethnicity. Regardless, even, of whether they are workers or the owners of farms or small businesses. Populism is not an indictment, but an opportunity. Focusing on the conflict between the haves and the have-nots is not divisive; it’s a way to build coalitions with astonishing potential. Our nation’s first antitrust law was passed at the demand of small farmers bled dry by the railroads and grain elevators. But when Ohio’s John Sherman stood on the floor of the Senate to call for its passage in 1890, he didn’t just do it for the Grangers. He also talked about labor. The trust “commands the price of labor without fear of strikes,” he declared, “for in its field it allows no competitors.” When the law was abused to crack down on strikers, Samuel Gompers mobilized the American Federation of Labor and won corrections in the 1914 Clayton Act to try to guarantee them that right, while tightening other loopholes that John Rockefeller and the other robber barons had exploited. Gompers called the law a “Magna Carta for labor.” Then in 1936, small-town grocers came in to press for and win a separate law to stop the incipient A&P grocery chain—ancestor of the modern big-box stores—from cutting secret deals with their suppliers that slashed prices for A&P while marking them up for the little guys. Our anti-monopoly laws exist because of the work of farmers, labor unions, and country grocers. If that seems like an unlikely bunch, consider that Minnesota still does not have a “Democratic” party, but rather a Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, because of a resurgence of that coalition 30 years after the Sherman Act. Consider that the pharmacy deserts in Appalachia are caused by the same ruthless middlemen who create those deserts in Philadelphia. I know, because a session I had with the Philadelphia pharmacists was nearly identical to one I’d had in Charleston. The same goes for independent grocers. The people in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, live in an incipient food desert for the same reason that the people of downtown North Tulsa do: The government stopped enforcing the 1936 law (it was called the Robinson-Patman Act). And when we start enforcing it again, poor people in small towns and big cities—people told every day that they have nothing in common—will benefit in equal measure. I feel the potential for those fights anytime I hear how some conservatives talk about the tenure of Lina Khan, whom I served alongside when she was chair of the Federal Trade Commission. I felt it when I talked to people about my job. I had a favorite kind of conversation as a commissioner. I had some version of it at least three or four times. It was when a MAGA conservative asked me—a certified “left-wing activist,” “provocateur,” “bomb-thrower,” and “extremist”—to quote my friend Ted Cruz: What exactly is it you do in government? I would tell anyone who asked that I was investigating the pharmacy middlemen who were shutting down independent pharmacies across rural and urban America. I’d tell them I was suing Amazon for screwing over small retailers. I’d tell them I was making sure that the biggest grocery store in town doesn’t buy the next biggest grocery store in town—which will make eggs even more expensive and union negotiations even harder. I’d tell them I was trying to let gig workers organize so that Uber and Lyft and DoorDash couldn’t lie to them or cheat them out of their pay. I’d tell them I was suing landlords who pack rent bills with hidden fees. I definitely told them that we were trying to end that horrible thing where you sign up for something online but can only cancel on the phone before 4 p.m., after 45 minutes on hold. And usually, by that point, the conversation had changed. Their suspicion had turned into cautious interest, maybe even excitement. Undocumented people have become the new American underclass: good enough to pick our crops, bus our tables, and build our buildings—not good enough for us to protect their life or liberty, let alone their pursuit of happiness. There are many reasons for this. Some are legal. A lot of it is anger. I understand where some of the anger comes from. Take the construction industry. A generation of working-class kids grew up watching their dads provide for their families by working construction. They were hard jobs, but they were good ones. You could buy a house, send your kid to college, maybe even buy a boat for the weekends. Now, those jobs pay a fraction of what they used to. And those kids are now adults, voting adults, and they see those jobs occupied by men from Central and South America, many of whom are undocumented. What would it look like to confront undocumented immigration not as a left-right issue, but as a conflict between billionaires and working people? Maybe we focus less on the tension between undocumented people and the native-born workers that they seem to displace. Maybe we focus more on the billionaire developers who pretended that the people they hired were “independent contractors,” turning what used to be middle-class jobs into subsistence work, while also making it easier to hire and exploit undocumented laborers. Maybe we ask ourselves: Who gets rich from that? Is it the guy working in 100-degree heat with no water? Or is it the guy downing a steak while toasting his new development? Maybe we try to become skeptical of the idea that the least powerful people are the most responsible for our problems. Maybe we punch up instead of punching the neighbor. Nowadays, I think a lot about what’s happened to Ábrego García. The media has rightly focused on the outpouring of support for an apprentice sheet metal worker and his young family in Beltsville, Maryland. They are right to focus on the courthouse protests. They made a difference. But I have been moved by a different scene, which occurred in early April in a Washington, D.C., conference hall filled with electricians, ironworkers, and other tradespeople, members of the North America’s Building Trades Unions, where Ábrego García’s union is an affiliate. In this scene, NABTU president Sean McGarvey stands in front of his members, and says: We need to make our voices heard. We’re not red, we’re not blue. We’re the building trades, the backbone of America. You want to build a $5 billion data center? Want more six-figure careers with health care, retirement, and no college debt? You don’t call Elon Musk. You call us! [...] And yeah, that means all of us—all of us! Including our brother, SMART apprentice Kilmar Ábrego García, who we demand to be returned to us and his family now. He slams his fist on the podium. “Bring him home!” he shouts, as the audience gets out of their seats for a standing ovation. And that, to me, feels like the future. Alvaro M. Bedoya served as a federal trade commissioner from 2022 until President Trump fired him in March.

Title: Exclusive: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on AI, gold, tariffs, and crypto

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. I wasn’t surprised to see JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on stage yesterday at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit. I’ve interviewed several women leaders over the years—TIAA CEO Thasunda Brown Duckett, Travelers Chief Marketing Officer Lisa Caputo, Mary Callahan Erdoes, who runs JPMorgan Chase’s Asset & Wealth Management, and veteran finance executive Heidi Miller, among others—who consider Dimon an important mentor. Women make up half of JPMorgan’s board and seven of the 13 members of its operating committee. Dimon spoke with Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell about topics ranging from AI to blockchain, which you can read about here and here. Fresh from reporting a banner quarter, the bank chief expounded on AI, gold, regulation, jobs, tariffs, debt, government waste, New York’s mayoral race, and “the need to keep the Western world together economically.” You can check out the full interview here. And here’s what I’ve gleaned from attendees, when it comes to Dimon’s mentorship approach: Bet on Winners: Dimon helps people who’ve earned his respect and trust, whether it’s hiring people like Miller at multiple companies or advising Duckett during her inaugural year as CEO of TIAA. That instinct isn’t limited to women: Wells Fargo’s Charlie Scharf comes to mind. Dimon says he’s guided by performance, not gender or loyalty. To do otherwise, in his view, is a disservice to the team. Share your network: Lisa Caputo met Dimon after he’d been fired from Citigroup and she had just arrived there. As she put it yesterday: “I was trying to build a women’s business from scratch. Every time Jamie would call, he would give me the names of three people to talk to inside the company, and he would also ask me what I’d learned so far. Through my conversations with him, he was literally helping me shape what the business model could look like.” Go Beyond Borders: Anyone who launches a $1.5 trillion initiative is seeking a purpose beyond their own company. After almost two decades as CEO, Dimon expects ambitious people may leave. Part of his job is to help good people become better leaders wherever they go. The world needs more of them. Relationships matter. And having friends in far places helps a leader learn.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Why the U.S. Supreme Court might keep Trump’s tariffs On their face, President Trump’s trade tariffs are illegal because Congress did not approve them and because routine trade is not the “emergency” that Trump claims. But the U.S. Supreme Court may rule to leave them in place anyway because of the logistical difficulty of undoing them, according to former Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar. “The government is coming to court and saying, ‘We would have to unwind billions or trillions of dollars. It could bankrupt our nation,’” she said. Trump considers cooking oil ban for China “I believe that China purposefully not buying our Soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers, is an Economically Hostile Act. We are considering terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil, and other elements of Trade, as retribution. As an example, we can easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves, we don’t need to purchase it from China,” the president said on Truth Social. Investors took it as a signal that there would be no immediate compromise in the trade war, sending the S&P 500 down 0.16% on the day. Trump preps list of programs he will eliminate The U.S. government shutdown shows no sign of coming to an end. Yesterday the president said he was drawing up a list of “egregious socialist, semi-communist” government programs that he would eliminate permanently if Democrats in Congress don’t help him pass his spending bill. “We're closing up programs ... that we wanted to close up or that we never wanted to happen,” Trump said. “We're not going to let them come back.” Dimon issues private credit warning: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more” JPMorgan Chase wrote off $170 million in debt it was owed in the collapse of auto parts supply company First Brands, the company reported in its Q3 earnings call, and JPM CEO Jamie Dimon warned there may be more cracks in the private credit markets to come: “I probably shouldn’t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more. Everyone should be forewarned on this one.” Apollo Global Management chief Marc Rowan also warned of “late-cycle accidents” but Blackstone president Jonathan Gray said it was not a systemic problem. Powell hints at further rate cuts In a speech on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the institution is likely to cut rates again as a weak job market trumps inflation concerns. Policy changes may need to “take another step toward a more neutral stance,” Powell said at the National Association for Business Economics. Amazon is preparing a new round of layoffs Amazon is planning to lay off as much as 15% of the company’s human resources staff, according to sources familiar with the situation, with other departments likely to be affected as well. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel declined to comment on the situation. Mark Cuban says employees deserve more stock Billionaire Mark Cuban wrote in a post on X that companies should be better incentivized to give shares to their employees as stock gains multiply. The post was in response to a recent report from Oxfam showing that billionaire wealth has increased by $33 trillion since 2015. Sam Altman says OpenAI will allow “erotica for verified adults” “Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases,” he said. Separately, Deutsche Bank reported that subscriptions at OpenAI have “flatlined.” S&P 500 futures were up 0.47% this morning. The index closed down 0.16% in its last session. STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.53% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 0.31% in early trading. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 1.76%. China’s CSI 300 was up 1.48%. The South Korea KOSPI was up 2.68%.

Title: Amazon likely to cut 15% jobs in new round of AI-driven layoffs: Report
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/amazon-new-round-of-ai-driven-layoffs-report-10308167/
Time Published: 2025-10-15T07:45:44Z
Full Content:
Amazon is looking to eliminate 15 per cent of jobs from its human resources division even as the tech giant continues to aggressively invest in developing AI products and infrastructure. Internally referred to as the People Experience Technology (PXT) team, the HR division at Amazon comprises over 10,000 employees across the world, including a recruiting team, technology staff, and other HR-related roles. The upcoming round of layoffs at Amazon is expected to impact the PXT team hardest, according to a report by Fortune. Employees in other divisions involving Amazon’s core consumer business could also be affected by the layoffs, the report said. The exact number of employees that will be let go and when the layoffs are expected to happen is still unclear. The latest round of job cuts at Amazon comes amid a deteriorating job market for those in the tech sector, with several big tech companies looking to leverage AI tools in order to shrink headcounts and lower costs. While many AI-related layoffs are being framed as ‘restructuring’ efforts, big tech firms are simultaneously ramping up investments in data centres and compute to stay ahead in the AI arms race. Amazon, for instance, has earmarked over $100 billion in capital expenditures this year to build out its cloud and AI data centres. In June this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had announced in a memo to its 1.5 million employees that, as the company embraces AI tools across the organisation, it will ultimately “reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains” over time. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote. At the same time, Jassy also made a point to note that there won’t be room on the bus for everyone: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Jassy added that generative AI will ‘change the way our work is done,’ and said the company will eventually ‘need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.’ “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he further said. Taking over as CEO from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, Jassy oversaw the largest layoffs in the company’s history roughly two years ago, when Amazon cut at least 27,000 corporate jobs. Earlier this year, Amazon also laid off employees in its consumer devices unit, Wondery podcast division, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Meanwhile, the e-commerce giant also announced this week that it will be hiring over 2,50,000 seasonal employees across its warehouses and logistics networks in the US ahead of the holiday season. Pakistan and Afghanistan have a long history of tension and conflict, stemming from border disputes and control over transit and trade. The Durand Line has been a major point of contention, dividing Pashtun tribes and causing resentment in Afghanistan.

Amazon layoff news: E-commerce and tech giant Amazon is set to slash as much as 15 per cent roles in its human resources department, besides some other roles, in a new round of layoffs, Fortune reported citing sources. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel declined to respond, it added. While it is expected that Amazon's HR team, known internally as the People eXperience Technology team or PTX, which has over 10,000 staff globally, will take the most cuts, other core consumer business departments could also see some impact, two sources told the publication. As per the report, these job cuts come as the giant looks to reduce employee costs amid heavy investment in artificial intelligence products and AI infrastructure. Amazon has stated it aims to spend over $100 billion capex in 2025 to build its AI data centres and cloud computing centres. These will be for sale to customers and for internal use, the report added. From late 2022 into 2023, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy signed off on at least 27,000 job cuts at Amazon — largely from its corporate offices. The period saw many large tech companies, including Meta and Google, slashing jobs. In June, Andy Jassy in a company memo stressed the importance of AI adoption to employees. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he added. Amazon.com Inc. plans to hire 2,50,000 workers during its peak holiday season in full-time, part-time and seasonal roles. The company in a statement said that temporary workers will earn $19 per hour on average, and permanent roles will pay $23 per hour on average. The 2,50,000 workers on holiday hire is unchanged from the previous two years, a Bloomberg report noted.

Amazon is planning to cut human resources staff by 15%, Fortune reported, citing sources. People eXperience Technology Team, human resource department of the company, will be the worst hit in the move. Core consumer business will probably to be affected by the move as well. Fortune's report did not mention how many number of employees, and when they will be laid off. Amazon's PXT division has more than 10,000 employees worldwide. The team includes a large recruiting team, plus technology staff and other traditional human resource roles, the report said. Compared to other companies, Amazon has laid off a relatively small number of people early this year. The layoffs happened in its consumer devices unit, Wondery podcast division, and in the Amazon web series. The company is looking for ways to lower employee costs while investing aggressively in artificial intelligence products and infrastructure. Amazon intends to increase the use of AI for internal use and to sell to enterprise customers, Fortune said. Amazon has planned to spend upwards of $100 billion capital expenditure this year as it builds its cloud and AI data centres, according to the report. Meanwhile, Amazon will likely add 250,000 to its workforce during its peak season, Bloomberg reported. The aggressive hiring during holiday season makes the company a standout in an otherwise bleak holiday labour market. Amazon will hire for full-time, part-time, and season roles with temporary workers earning an average of $19 per hour, Bloomberg reported, citing a statement from Amazon. Pay for permanent roles averages $23 per hour. US shoppers will likely spend $253.4 billion on online shopping during November and December, which indicates a 5.3% upside from 2024, according to Adobe Inc. However, shoppers are also planning to curb overall holiday spending because of tariff-related price increases and a weakening labour market, according to a survey released in September by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Bloomberg reported.

Title: Amazon is planning a new wave of layoffs, sources say

Jason Del Rey is a technology correspondent at Fortune and a co-chair of the Fortune Brainstorm Tech and Fortune Brainstorm AI conferences. Amazon is preparing to cut as much as 15% of its human resources staff, with additional layoffs likely in other divisions, according to multiple sources familiar with the plans. Two sources told Fortune that Amazon’s human resources division—known internally as PXT or the People eXperience Technology team—will be hard-hit, but that other areas of Amazon’s core consumer business are also likely to be affected. It couldn’t be learned how many employees in total Amazon plans to let go, nor the exact timing of the cuts. The company laid off relatively small numbers of employees earlier this year in areas such as its consumer devices unit, its Wondery podcast division, and in Amazon Web Services. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel declined to comment.Amazon’s PXT division, which reports to senior vice president Beth Galetti, has more than 10,000 employees worldwide, and includes a large recruiting team, plus technology staff and other traditional HR roles. The new cuts come as Amazon continues to look for ways to lower employee costs while investing aggressively in AI products and infrastructure—both for internal use and to sell to enterprise customers. The company has said it intends to devote upwards of $100 billion to capital expenditures this year, as it builds out its cloud and AI data centers. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy already oversaw the largest layoffs in company history from late 2022 into 2023, when the company cut at least 27,000 corporate jobs, which accounted for a high-single-digit percentage of the company’s office jobs. Many other Big Tech companies also slashed their headcounts around that time as the pandemic receded and consumer demand trends changed.Now, many employers are looking to harness the power of AI—initially for mundane and repetitive tasks and eventually for more complicated jobs—to reduce the need to maintain the same level of human staffers on their payrolls.Jassy himself is one of them. The CEO fired a bit of a warning shot to his own employees in June, when he encouraged them to welcome this new AI-powered era. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote in a companywide email that was also published on Amazon’s corporate blog. At the same time, Jassy also made a point to note that there won’t be room on the bus for everyone: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Jassy, who succeeded Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in the CEO job in 2021, has earned a reputation as a cost-cutter (though to be fair, he inherited a company that many say had become wasteful and bloated in some areas). Amazon executives regularly require managers to hit a certain percentage goal for unregretted attrition, or URA—essentially a percentage of employees that the company would be okay losing, whether through voluntary departures, being “managed out,” or through formal layoffs. But sources told Fortune that these cuts are being discussed in a different way internally than the typical URA process. While Amazon plans these layoffs of corporate roles, the company announced its usual holiday hiring spree of warehouse staff on Tuesday. This year, the company will hire 250,000 seasonal employees across its U.S. warehouse and logistics networks. Amazon’s stock price is down a little more than 1% this calendar year, but 15% higher than it was 12 months earlier. The company will report earnings later this month.

Title: A Paralegal’s AI Best Friend
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/the-prompt/2025/10/14/a-paralegals-ai-best-friend/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T23:45:05Z
Full Content:
ByRashi Shrivastava, Forbes Staff. Welcome back to The Prompt. About a year ago, Viraj Bindra watched as his friend’s law firm struggled with a deluge of cases, far more than it had the capacity to handle. In the end, the firm had to turn away cases that had a fair chance of winning simply because it didn’t have the bandwidth. Bindra soon learned that this is a widespread problem that impacts a lot of people: Some 77% of American households can’t access legal help when they need it, in part due to staffing shortages at law firms. “For everyday Americans, counsel is more of a luxury than a right,” he said. So Bindra, an ex-DoorDash product manager, decided to build AI software to ease that burden–and help lawyers more easily manage lots of clients. In April 2025, he launched Finch, a voice-based AI system that automates administrative tasks typically done by paralegals, such as retrieving medical records, setting up and tracking insurance claims, etc. The startup also hires its own paralegals to ensure and improve the accuracy of its product. Finch is “taking on the work that otherwise a law firm would've had to hire staff to do,” he said. The New York-based startup is selling its technology to personal injury lawyers and plaintiff firms that make money based on contingency, meaning they aren’t paid unless there’s a settlement or victory at trial. These lawyers are more incentivized to use AI than those who bill their clients hourly, as it helps their staff’s productivity and allows them to take on more cases, Bindra said. In just six months, Bindra claims his startup has seen significant revenue growth though he declined to disclose specific numbers. The company announced today it has raised $20 million in Series A funding led by Redpoint Ventures, which valued it at $100 million, according to a person familiar with the round. It’s a solid start, but Finch faces a growing cluster of competitors with startups like Harvey, Legora and EvenUp already emerging as front runners in the AI legal landscape. Meera Clark, a partner at Redpoint Ventures said Finch’s biggest differentiator is its focus on helping smaller law firms save direct labor costs. Let’s get into the headlines. BIG PLAYS Retail giant Walmart is doubling down on AI. The company announced a partnership with OpenAI that will allow users to shop for its products directly through ChatGPT. The idea is that people who are already using the tool to plan meals and find new recipes can also buy needed ingredients while they’re at it. In recent months, OpenAI has made a concerted effort to add e-commerce capabilities to ChatGPT, recently forging similar deals with Shopify and Etsy. CHIPS + COMPUTE On the heels of its massive deal with chip giant AMD, OpenAI announced yet another partnership, this time with Broadcom. Under this deal, OpenAI will design its own chips to train and run its models while Broadcom will provide infrastructure support like networking systems and custom chips for its planned buildout of 10 gigawatts worth of AI data centers. Broadcom’s shares jumped after the announcement, similar to other companies that have announced multi-billion dollar partnerships with OpenAI. CEO Sam Altman is clearly adept at crafting these deals, Bloomberg’s Matt Levine writes, by selling established companies a “world-changing vision” of the future of artificial intelligence to raise historic amounts of capital. SHOW ME THE MONEY Salesforce plans to invest $15 billion in San Francisco over the next five years to ramp up AI adoption across enterprises, the company said at its annual Dreamforce conference, though details on the investment are still unclear. The funding will be used to create an AI incubator hub on its San Francisco campus and upskill employees on how to use AI. Investors seemed unimpressed by the announcement–its share price closed down 3.6%, continuing the 28% slide it's seen so far this year. DEEP DIVE It’s been a big year for AI infrastructure deals. In just the last month, OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia, AMD and others have announced epic transactions worth hundreds of billions of dollars. The deals are complex, unconventional—and often circular: Nvidia’s up to $100 billion investment in OpenAI, announced late last month, for instance, will allow OpenAI to purchase Nvidia GPUs to build out its own data center capacity. In a similar deal that flips who gets equity, AMD and OpenAI recently announced their own strategic partnership in which OpenAI got a warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock, or 10% of AMD’s shares, that vests in tranches based on OpenAI using 6 gigawatts of AMDs GPUs over a period of time. Behind this spate of deals is something of a stampede mentality. “The world needs much more compute,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X announcing the AMD deal. Altman has been trumpeting that “more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission” for years. “There's so much impatience and desire to move quickly and fear of getting left behind that there’s a very high premium on getting the most you can the fastest,” says Stella Biderman, executive director of AI nonprofit EleutherAI, which trained an open-source version of GPT-3 on CoreWeave GPUs. And that’s leading them to make these scratch-my-back deals that are literally set up to help them help one another. Thanks in large part to the big deals, valuations are skyrocketing, and the billionaire founders, executives and investors tied to the massive AI data center buildout have benefited the most. By Forbes’ count, 20 of the most notable billionaires tied to the explosive growth in AI infrastructure spending have already added more than $450 billion to their fortunes since January 1. Read the full story on Forbes. MODEL BEHAVIOR AI-powered bots accounted for around 51 percent of internet traffic in 2024. Thanks to Sora, OpenAI’s social media platform to share AI-generated videos, more AI slop is proliferating across social media, making it harder to distinguish between what’s real and what’s fake. Large language models are writing everything from tweets to blog posts to resumes while fake candidates are giving job interviews to AI agents, opening bank accounts and buying concert tickets. All that AI has led tech leaders like Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to propound the “dead internet theory”— the idea that the internet is dominated by bots instead of humans. Once dismissed as a conspiracy theory, this may be coming true in the age of AI.

Title: This Gold Rush Is Ominous

The king of precious metals is having a good run right now. That might be a problem. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. When prices are high and global conflicts destabilize the world, some investors start looking backwards—away from an uncertain future and toward the predictability of the past. And what’s older and more dependable than gold? Last week, amid widespread geopolitical turmoil and a weakening U.S. dollar, the price of gold hit a historic high of $4,000 an ounce. This year has so far been gold’s best since 1979, a moment of instability so profound that it led to recession. Gold prices are much closer to a genuine “recession indicator” than, say, the resurgence of frozen yogurt or an uptick in Uber Eats orders. That’s because, over the past 50 years, spikes in the price of gold have typically been correlated with widespread inflation and geopolitical dysfunction. In 1979, amid double-digit inflation numbers in the United States and a global energy crisis, investors stocked up on the precious metal as a way to counter those shocks. In the years following the 2008 financial crisis, as investors lost trust in major institutions once seen as “too big to fail,” gold prices shot up again. And when persistent inflation was crushing the U.S. dollar after the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, gold once again soared. The precious metal has long been considered a safe-haven asset, because, unlike the U.S. dollar, its inherent value isn’t determined by any state government. Although it’s probably not realistic for everyone to start piling into Diamond District jewelry shops and hoarding gold bars, gold remains an appealing, if old-fashioned, alternative to more contemporary investments: Its value stems from its shine and rarity, not its ability to produce a line of credit. Some investors see gold as a standard way to diversify their portfolio. Others, stereotypically known as goldbugs, tend to be broadly skeptical about contemporary monetary policy. Just as investors in bitcoin, so-called digital gold, have historically skewed libertarian and anti-institutional, the most extreme goldbugs are betting against the system, doubtful that the Federal Reserve is capable of keeping the U.S. dollar strong. There’s also only so much of the metal lodged in the planet’s crust, compared with the dollar, which can be printed ad infinitum. At least until someone like Elon Musk figures out how to increase its supply by mining asteroids, gold will likely remain the doomer’s hedge of choice. Whereas a different sort of investor looks to get in early on promising new technological innovations, the goldbug doesn’t lose sight of what’s tried-and-true. Gold prices have already risen more than 50 percent this year and are showing no signs of stopping. The story of today’s gold boom began in 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine and Western governments decided to sanction the Russian central bank by freezing its foreign-exchange reserves. The scale of these sanctions was a reminder of why countries might want to own assets that can’t be easily frozen. Especially in emerging markets, central banks around the world “realized that the truly only safe asset” is gold, Daan Struyven, a co-head of Global Commodities Research at Goldman Sachs, told me. The whiplash of President Donald Trump’s tariff spree this spring introduced new uncertainties for the global market. No nation or territory was off-limits (including remote islands inhabited only by penguins and seals). Trump’s scattershot approach has had clear consequences, especially for countries with fledgling markets. Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, and Indonesia are among the many nations now buying gold by the ton, according to World Bank data—ostensibly to insulate themselves from any future shocks caused by U.S. policy. Meanwhile, Struyven explained, the ongoing question of whether America’s own central bank will retain its independence could also be contributing to gold’s historic run, because “the gold price tends to rise when questions about central-bank governance rise.” The other main driver of this price spike is less abstract. Some Wall Streeters are concerned that the value of the U.S. dollar will continue to erode as the national debt climbs and the Federal Reserve loses its grip on the currency. They’re making what’s become known as the “Debasement Trade,” shifting money away from the weakening U.S. dollar and into harder, more independent assets such as gold and bitcoin. Shrinkflation, stagflation, good-old-fashioned inflation—all of it means that your paycheck doesn’t go as far as it once did, and all of it is good for gold. The mystery of the current gold rally is that the S&P 500 is also up. The stock-market index reached an all-time high earlier this month, which would seem to suggest that the American economy isn’t quite as close to the brink as the price of gold might indicate. But the reality probably has to do with a bifurcated market. Joe Davis, Vanguard’s global chief economist, told The New York Times on Saturday that this rare case of gold and stocks moving in a parallel upward trend has to do with “dramatically different” investor perspectives: The optimists are going with equities, and the pessimists are going with gold. In today’s economy, there’s room enough for both. Another way to put it is that a bet on the S&P 500 amounts to faith in the fruits of modern industry: AI and renewable energy, to name a couple. A bet on gold is a recognition that all empires eventually fall, and a return to something much more ancient.

Evening Read The Drink That Americans Won’t Give Up Without a Fight By Ellen Cushing Coffee is in trouble. Even before the United States imposed tariffs of 50 percent on Brazil and 20 percent on Vietnam—which together produce more than half of the world’s coffee beans—other challenges, including climate-change-related fires, flooding, and droughts, had already forced up coffee prices globally. Today, all told, coffee in the U.S. is nearly 40 percent more expensive than it was a year ago. Futures for arabica coffee—the beans most people in the world drink—have increased by almost a dollar since July. And prices may well go up further: Tariffs have “destabilized an already volatile market,” Sara Morrocchi, the CEO of the coffee consultancy Vuna, told me. This is a problem for the millions of people who grow and sell coffee around the world. It is also a problem for the people who rely on coffee for their base executive functioning—such a problem that Congress recently introduced a bipartisan bill to specifically protect coffee from Trump’s tariffs.

Title: AI Deals Are Scaling to Massive Valuations. But In Many Cases—Also Massive Dilution. See e.g., OpenAI
URL: https://www.saastr.com/ai-deals-are-scaling-to-massive-valuations-but-in-many-cases-also-massive-dilution-see-e-g-openai/

by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), SaaStr.Ai So there has never been a “start-up” like OpenAI. Already with 800,000,000+ users and a breathtaking $500 Billion (!) valuation. But it’s also raised and spent epic amounts. So as the chart from FT below shows — all the historic investors together, as a group, will likely own 10% after the company converts to a for-profit. All of them. From Khosla to Thrive to Founders Fund and more. OpenAI has now raised approximately $58 billion in primary funding across 11 rounds, with an additional $6.6 billion secondary sale in October 2025 at the $500 billion valuation. But the cash burn? That’s where it gets interesting. The company now projects it will burn $115 billion through 2029—that’s $80 billion higher than previously expected. Let that sink in. Not $115 billion raised. $115 billion burned. Breaking it down: This isn’t mismanagement. This is the cost of competing in frontier AI. The numbers are staggering: A 17x increase in less than three years. But when you’ve raised $58 billion and are burning over $100 billion to get there, the ownership math tells a different story. Looking at the projected ownership post-restructure (per FT Research and other sources): For founders and early investors who weren’t Microsoft, the dilution has been severe. Eight of the eleven original co-founders have left. Early VCs who got in at sub-$30 billion valuations have seen their ownership percentages compressed dramatically—even as the absolute dollar value has grown. The cap table now includes 11 funding rounds. What makes OpenAI’s story unique is who’s investing and why: Microsoft isn’t just an investor—they’re existentially dependent on OpenAI. Their entire AI strategy—Azure growth, Office Copilots, enterprise AI positioning—runs through OpenAI infrastructure. They’ll keep funding to protect that relationship. But they also receive ~20% of OpenAI’s revenue through their partnership agreement, creating a circular funding dynamic. Nvidia invested $100 million in October 2024 and gets paid back immediately through GPU purchases. They’ve invested in 50+ AI startups creating a circular economy where investment dollars flow back as compute revenue. Part of Microsoft’s and Nvidia’s investment effectively returns to their own coffers. SoftBank went from a $500 million investor in October 2024 to leading a $30 billion round six months later. That’s not normal venture behavior—that’s Masayoshi Son making a macro bet on AGI. Their commitment is so aggressive that if OpenAI doesn’t complete its for-profit conversion by December 31, 2025, SoftBank’s investment could be slashed from $30 billion to as low as $20 billion. Traditional VCs are playing a different game: raising larger funds on the AI narrative, marking up valuations in subsequent rounds, and hoping an exit materializes. But with 60+ investors on the cap table, exit dynamics will be complicated. Honestly it’s kind of based that employees will own 3x as much of OpenAI as VCs https://t.co/7MoOk6L8A1 — Luke Metro (@luke_metro) October 14, 2025 The October 2025 secondary sale is particularly revealing. OpenAI had authorized up to $10.3 billion in shares for sale but only about $6.6 billion ultimately changed hands. Why did employees sell less than authorized? Two possibilities: Either way, this was the second major secondary in a year—a clear signal that liquidity events are necessary to retain talent competing with Meta’s nine-figure offers and public company stock compensation. Here’s the structural complexity that matters: current investors still don’t own actual equity. They hold convertible notes that only convert to shares after the nonprofit-to-for-profit restructuring completes. This requires: The deadline? December 31, 2025. If the conversion fails, SoftBank’s investment drops from $30 billion to $20 billion, and other investors can demand their money back with 9% interest. That’s a potential $40+ billion liability. The OpenAI model isn’t replicable—but the dynamics are instructive: For AI infrastructure founders: If you’re building frontier models, you’re signing up for capital requirements that dwarf traditional SaaS. You’ll need to raise 4-5x your revenue run rate continuously. You might own 5-15% of something huge rather than 25% of something modest. And you’ll need to accept strategic investors who become customers, partners, and dependencies simultaneously. For AI application founders: The good news is you probably don’t need the OpenAI model. If you’re building on top of foundation models, your capital requirements are dramatically lower. But you’re also betting that OpenAI, Anthropic, or another provider maintains reasonable API pricing as they burn billions. For investors: Traditional venture math is broken in frontier AI. A 10x return on a $500 billion valuation requires a $5 trillion outcome. You’re not investing for returns—you’re investing for: To be fair, the revenue growth is real: At a $500 billion valuation on $12.7 billion revenue, that’s roughly a 39x revenue multiple. For context, Salesforce trades at 8-9x, ServiceNow at 20x. But both are profitable. The bet is that by 2029, at $100 billion in revenue, a $500 billion valuation would be 5x revenue—reasonable for a high-growth software company. But that requires executing flawlessly for four years while burning $115 billion and fending off Google, Meta, Anthropic, and everyone else building AGI. Yes, OpenAI scaled to a $500 billion valuation faster than any company in history. Yes, they’re generating $12.7 billion in revenue with 500 million weekly users. Yes, they’ve created a new market category and changed how the world thinks about AI. But they’ve also: The valuation is spectacular. The dilution is equally spectacular. The capital requirements are unprecedented. The burn rate is staggering. All of these things are true simultaneously. This is the new reality of frontier AI. Not every hot AI deal will look like this, but many infrastructure plays will require similar capital intensity. The question isn’t whether you can raise at massive valuations—OpenAI proved you can. The question is whether the dilution, complexity, and burn make sense for your business model and your exit strategy. For most AI companies, the answer is no. For foundation model companies competing for AGI, it might be the only path forward.

Artificial intelligence is reshaping jobs worldwide. Many roles involving repetitive tasks face automation. However, new opportunities are emerging in AI development and other sectors. Sectors like data entry and customer service face the highest risk. Workers need to reskill to adapt. This shift demands new strategies for businesses and governments to ensure a smooth transition and protect employment.

October 14, 2025 14:26 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA MAHIA, New Zealand, Oct. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its 15th mission of the year and the first of 21 new launches for Synspective. The “Owl New World” mission launched on Electron from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 16:33 UTC on October 14 to deploy the seventh StriX satellite to a 583km low Earth orbit. The mission was the first of a series of 21 dedicated Electron launches to take place between now and the end of the decade for Synspective, a leading Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data and analytics company from Japan. It was also the seventh Electron mission completed for Synspective since launches to deploy their constellation began in December 2020. Altogether, Rocket Lab will launch 27 missions for Synspective, making Electron the primary launcher of their constellation. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: “Another Electron launch for Synspective with 100% mission success, and a fantastic start to an exciting run of upcoming launches to deploy their constellation. Precise, direct access to orbit is essential to the iteration and growth of constellations already in space, and I’m proud of the Rocket Lab team for delivering this again and again for Synspective across every launch.” Synspective founder and CEO, Dr. Motoyuki Arai, said: “I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the team at Rocket Lab for safely and successfully carrying out this mission, as well as to all the members of Synspective who made this achievement possible. Moving forward, we will continue to leverage our satellite and data analytics technologies to address global challenges, such as security, disaster management, and environmental sustainability, thereby contributing to the creation of a more resilient and sustainable future.” Electron’s unbeaten combination of reliability, rapid execution, and exceptional satellite deployment accuracy in the space industry’s commercial small-lift launch class has made it the favored rocket for constellation operators globally. Rocket Lab is expected to surpass its previous annual launch record achieved in 2024 with 16 launches, with scheduled missions for other commercial constellation operators and international space agencies in the coming weeks that are set to meet the Company’s forecast of 20+ launches in 2025.

The major U.S. equities indexes rebounded Tuesday afternoon from earlier losses amid lingering worries about U.S.-China trade tensions. The Dow and S&P 500 were slightly higher, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was little changed. Intel (INTC) shares dropped to lead losses on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq after a downgrade by Bank of America analysts to "underperform" from "neutral," saying the stock has climbed "too far, too fast" on optimism about recent AI deals. Arista Networks (ANET) shares also fell after Nvidia (NVDA) announced Meta Platforms (META) and Oracle (ORCL) will use its data center switches, increasing competition with those from Arista. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN) and other firms tied to cryptocurrencies sank along with the prices of digital coins. Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) shares gained after the pizza delivery giant posted earnings and revenue that topped analysts' estimates as promotions and demand for its stuffed crust pizza boosted sales. Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC) also climbed after the financial firm exceeded profit forecasts and boosted its profitability guidance as federal regulators lifted a cap on the bank's growth as punishment for a fake account scandal. Walmart (WMT) shares rose after the biggest brick-and-mortar retailer said it is partnering with OpenAI to allow customers to buy goods from Walmart through ChatGPT. Gold prices climbed to notch a fresh high above $4,100 an ounce. Crude oil futures slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was slightly lower. The U.S. dollar gained on the pound, but lost ground to the euro and yen.

Title: This Protects You From An AI Bubble, Pays 7.7% Dividends

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. I know, I know. This levitating stock market feels like a bubble that will burst any day. So I get it if you’re nervous. And that’s actually a good thing. It pays to be wary when everyone else is throwing money at any asset—stocks included. My take? Well, it might surprise you, but it’s this: We’re not in a bubble—AI-driven or otherwise. But I get the fear—which is why we’re going to look at a two-step move that addresses it. This “best of both worlds” play gives us yields up to 8.2% and a hedge if, say, bullish analysts (like me!) end up wrong and the so-called “AI bubble” pops. Like I said, I think that’s unlikely. But in any market, it always pays to spread out our risks, which is why I think this two-step move makes a lot of sense now. You don’t have to look far to see what’s driving bubble worries. Over the last six months, stocks have soared 32.4%, or 65% annualized. There’s no way that can continue. Right? This perspective keeps people out of stocks, but we need to zoom out. Over the long haul, stocks have done well (but not too well) no matter when you bought them. Over the last decade, stocks have risen 12.9% on average per year. That’s above the century-long average of 10.5%, but not far above. And a higher gain now than in, say, the 1930s, makes sense. After all, our technology is better, and our companies are more efficient. So why shouldn’t stocks rise a bit faster than they used to? So, at the very least, we can say that the last decade has been very good for stocks, but not bubbly. To see what a real bubble looks like, let’s flip back 30 years or so. From 1996 to 2000, stocks returned 24.3% annualized. But most important, that was after several years of strong performance. Meantime, our recent strong market comes after two big selloffs: first due to the pandemic in 2020, and second due to misplaced recession fears in 2022. So a bit of short-term outperformance to offset short-term underperformance makes sense. And that’s before we talk about AI. I had a chat with an old friend who’s now the head of the English department at a small liberal-arts school. He was telling me that he doesn’t know how to plan the curriculum for the upcoming school year because, as he put it, “All anyone wants to talk about is artificial intelligence.” If even liberal-arts schools are obsessed over AI, should we worry that we’re in a bubble? If you look at Google Trends for the phrase “AI bubble,” you can see that, well, there is a bubble of worry about AI. No wonder the AI-bubble case is capturing the thinking of banks, private equity investors and journalists. But let’s stress test this assumption. Our first stop? The CNN Fear and Greed Index. A lack of greed has led to a “neutral” reading, or a market where the fears of bubble prognosticators and the hopes of pollyanna-ish speculators cancel each other out. This is a realistic indicator that, no, we’re not in a bubble—at least not at the inflationary peak of the bubble cycle. A lot of data is telling us that the economy is strong and inflation is high—and that’s not me talking, it’s Apollo Investment’s chief economist, who makes this argument clearly with a slew of charts. Let me just share what I think is the most important point. If Americans’ fear about their jobs is declining and well off earlier peaks (see the far right side of the above chart), we’re far from a situation where this harms the economy. I’m not saying that will never happen—just that it isn’t coming soon. Moreover, a recent study has shown AI isn’t taking jobs. “The labor market doesn’t feel great, so it feels correct that AI is taking people’s jobs,” says Martha Gimbel, one of the Yale academics who authored the study. “But we’ve looked at this many, many different ways, and we really cannot find any sign that this is happening.” So, what is happening? In short, AI is boosting corporate profits. Over the long-term, we’ve seen earnings growth on a steady upward track, with the pandemic breaking that trend. But setting that aside, we’re back on that trend. In part, that’s thanks to things getting back to normal (hence the big jump in late 2021 and early 2022), but it’s also partly due to the 10% earnings rise in the past year, far above the 6.7% annual earnings growth of the S&P 500 over the last 50 years. In other words, stocks are rising more now because profits are doing the same, and technology will likely cause that trend to continue. Nonetheless, if you’re still concerned we’re in a bubble, I have a solution: a closed-end fund (CEF) that sells covered-call options. Under these deals, the fund sells investors the right to buy its stocks when they hit a certain price at a fixed future date. No matter what happens, the fund keeps the fee it charges for this and uses it to fund its dividend. It’s a strategy that does best in volatile markets. So if you hold a fund that invests in the S&P 500 broadly, you have a nice setup for gains in an up market and a bit of a hedge in a down one—say if we do see some short-term correction around AI. That leads us to the Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX), which yields 7.7%—handing us a nice “cash cushion” in the form of that high dividend. It also owns the S&P 500, so you’re getting a nice mix of large cap AI players, like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), and those that benefit from AI, like Visa (V). The problem with the covered-call strategy is that it can cap our upside in the long run, as the fund’s best stocks are sold, or “called away.” That’s why I prefer the 8.2%-yielding Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), a “pure” equity CEF that’s a holding in my CEF Insider service. This one not only has a strong long-term track record (it’s up over 200% in the last decade, including dividends) but has both increased regular payouts and paid out some huge special dividends, too. Sure, that dividend does float a bit, but that’s because it’s tied to the fund’s underlying performance. It’s actually a good setup as it gives management latitude to reinvest its profits without worrying about being tied to a fixed payout. That, in turn, drives further upside for us. Moreover, as I write this, ASG trades at an 8.2% discount to NAV, which is much more generous than its historical average of 2.2%. That puts additional upside (beyond the stock market’s future gains) on the table as that discount returns to normal. It’s a sweet setup that lets us ride further AI gains and grab big dividends, too—something those who limit themselves to mainstream AI stocks simply can’t get.

Title: Looking for Taylor Swift Returns
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/looking-for-taylor-swift-returns/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T15:59:28Z
Full Content:
By Byron King PostedOctober 14, 2025 Legend has it that in November 2004 Taylor Swift was “discovered” in Nashville. A youngster at the time, merely 14 years old, she was playing guitar and singing at the Bluebird Café when a music promoter heard her, took a look, and decided that this gal was going places. And as you surely know, today she’s a huge mega-star. Taylor Swift in Nashville, but no I didn’t see her. Courtesy billboard.com. Well, I was in Nashville too, last week in fact. But sorry to say, I didn’t see Taylor Swift, nor did I discover any future big-time songstresses. Indeed, I didn’t even hit the music scene. Because I was busy. I was on the company clock at a Paradigm Press event at Nashville’s Renaissance Hotel; me, numerous colleagues, a bunch of audiovisual bubbas, and about 800 guests. We all came together to discuss U.S. and global markets, particularly with respect to precious metals, other critical metals, technology, biotech, crypto, macro trends and much more. Many things are booming in the markets, with some offering “Swift” returns just now, if you’ll excuse the pun, and the numbers are eye-popping (see below). So, I’ll leave singing to Taylor Swift and instead discuss a few things that I heard in Nashville about making money. And really; some of the investment ideas from Nashville could possibly go “Taylor Swift” upside on you if things play out. Let’s dig in… I’ll begin with what I heard from a colleague and friend Ray Blanco, our resident tech and biotech guru. How good is Ray? Well, he (humbly) reminded us of how in 2015 he recommended a then-modest chipmaking company called Nvidia (NVDA); yes, that one. When you adjust for splits, Ray’s 2015 entry price was $0.50 per share; and consider that today’s bid/ask for Nvidia is over $188. In other words, in the past decade Ray delivered readers a gain of over 37,500%. And yes, you are reading that number correctly. Which means that Ray has minted more than a few multimillionaires if they held their original shares, or even if they sold off fractions of their holding on the way up. Ray explained how he did it, and it began with a tech conference in Las Vegas in 2015. There, he took a hard look at Nvidia when the company’s brand emphasized its specialized chips for video gaming consoles. Back then, gaming and gamers were kind of a geeky niche market, but Ray discerned that the same processing capability that delivers game-quality video might transfer over to other areas. And this led to his Nvidia recommendation. As events unfolded, it turned out that Nvidia chips could process immensely large data streams. Thus, Nvidia’s chips were particularly useful for crypto mining, and more recently for massive bit-crunching that goes on with artificial intelligence (AI). And so, Nvidia leads the tech charge these days, and boasts a market cap over $4.5 trillion (yes, trillion with a “t”). Hmm… Kind of a Taylor Swift story, when you think about it. Having established his cred, Ray went on to discuss what he has up his sleeve now. The short answer is that Ray sees a massive robot revolution coming to America. Indeed, Ray envisions America’s old Rust Belt transforming into a “Robot Belt.” It’s in the beginning phases and rapidly ramping up big-time as Ray looks out five to ten more years. Ray foresees robots coming to job sites almost everywhere, from office work to stores and warehouses, factories, farms, mines, mills and more. And Ray explained how the rise of robots will dovetail nicely with American demographics, considering the aging Baby Boomers and how the trend is to replace people in jobs that are repetitive and boring if not physically dangerous. In one example of the robotic future, Ray showed an astonishing video of an AI-controlled farm implement that navigates through plowed fields, a self-driving robot-tractor, so to speak. It identifies weeds with advanced optics and zaps them with a laser beam. This beast can work all day, and even at night because of its night-vision capabilities. In essence, this machine – truly a system of systems – will make farming way more efficient, and also eliminate the need for quite a lot of agricultural chemicals currently in use. And absent the agrichemicals, it’ll lead to healthier food in general. Of course, China too is building its own versions of robot workers, factories, etc., and the Chinese are aggressive. So obviously, the U.S. must compete hard to make things work out for our own economy. And along these lines, Ray laid out several investable non-Chinese opportunities in the robot arena. Meanwhile in Nashville, many of us were watching the charts, but not for Taylor Swift’s latest album. No, we were watching as the price of gold popped over $4,000 per ounce, while silver hit the $50 level. Clearly, something is going on. I learned long ago, in geochemistry class at Harvard (back at “that” Harvard, not the current one), that gold and silver atoms don’t change over time. Indeed, elements like gold and silver are formed in stellar supernovae, and to all intent and purpose are immutable. In other words, the metals don’t change, but their rising price reflects the fall in value of our currency, created and controlled by not-so-cosmic forces in Washington, D.C. And then this week, as the newly reinaugurated Columbus Day holiday unfolded, gold broke over $4,100 and silver crossed above $52; and yes, these prices can bounce around, up and down, but the trend is clear: up-up-up for metals and down-down-down for dollars. As I’ve noted many times, the chief driver for rising gold prices over the past three years was buying by central banks that want to de-risk from holding dollars, definitely in a world of mercurial U.S. politics and sanctions. On the silver side, one key driver for rising prices has been global-scale industrial demand, particularly for more and more use in electronics and solar panels. One way or another, these demand forces push against supply, whether it’s new metal out of the mine pits, or from recycling what’s already here. Another angle on this rising trend for precious metal has to do with “paper” gold and silver, namely the worldwide trading system that pretends to sell metal but is actually just an elaborate gambling pit. That is, most precious metal trading has nothing to do with the metal; it’s all about buying or selling a claim on gold and silver bars that never leave the bullion bank. Except that… well, whoops! We currently have a massive imbalance between “paper” metal and the physical version, and this has created pressure within the physical supply chain. People, businesses and even governments are actually doing what’s called “standing for delivery” for precious metal from bullion banks, which in turn must come up with real ounces to wheel out onto the loading dock. With silver, for example, bullion banks have set themselves up with short positions on paper product; i.e., they sold claims on ounces that do not exist. And now, claimants want the metal but it’s not down in the vault. Indeed, we have far more claims via paper silver ounces than there are physical metal ounces available for delivery. And those delivery requests are surging, which is leading to a collapse in inventories. Looking ahead, markets appear to anticipate a breakout of “failures to deliver,” which will wreck confidence in the pricing structure. And thus, we’re on a trend that could lead to $100 an ounce for silver before year-end. This is what happens when markets become overly financialized, when leverage meets absolute scarcity in an environment of “panic.” That is, when just about everybody with a claim shows up at the same time to demand fulfillment on the underlying promise. I could go on with these points, but I want to switch over and discuss the mining side. Gold and silver prices are rising, which is easy to see at a glance. But what about the mining sector? Well, in general share prices for miners lag the rate of rise in the product they produce. Or look at it this way. Mining companies have an asset called an ore deposit in the ground, and they mine rock, process ore, and refine their material into mineral concentrates, if not produce actual gold or silver. And they carefully calculate costs along the way. Let’s say that in 2022, it cost a company $1,500 to mine an ounce of gold, and the metal sold for, say, $2,000 per ounce, a profit of $500. Okay, great. But now in 2025, let’s say that mining that same ounce of gold costs $2,100 (yes, inflation in labor, materials, energy, etc.), but the sales price is $4,100. Well, the profit has quadrupled from $500 to $2,000, or 4x what it was just a couple of years ago. Here’s a chart to help visualize things. Mining has become a cash machine. Courtesy Mr. Uppy on X/Twitter. In other words, miners in general are looking at serious cash flow benefits from gold and silver, not to mention better days ahead for whatever else comes out of the pits associated with precious metals, such as copper, lead, zinc, nickel and much more, depending on the geology. Looking ahead, if mining companies can keep their costs under control, and the price of energy stays reasonable (eg., oil prices don’t explode upwards), we should see superb cash flows and margins across the sector. And that will attract more and more investors who are currently fixated on the tech vaporware bubble. In other words, if you already own miners then good for you. If you don’t own them, you had better get on the train because it’s moving out of the station. Or stated another way… The mining sector is about to go all Taylor Swift on us. There’s more to say, but that’s enough for now. Thank you for subscribing and reading.

Title: What’s Behind The 40% Rise In META Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/14/whats-behind-the-40-rise-in-meta-stock/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T15:53:29Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. META’s stock has seen a solid 43% rise in the last six months. This growth is primarily fueled by a mix of factors, including upbeat quarterly performance and significant AI investments that boosted the core advertising business, leading to a rise in ad impressions and ad prices. Furthermore, rising user engagement across its apps contributed to investor optimism, all while the company returned capital to shareholders via $9.76 billion in share repurchases and $1.33 billion in dividend payments in Q2 alone. From a quantitative perspective, the 43% surge in Meta Platforms stock in the last six months was largely driven by a 33.5% change in the company's P/E Multiple. While there is more to this narrative than mere numbers, let's first dissect the stock price movement into its contributing factors. Investing in a single stock can be fraught with risk, but there is substantial benefit to a more diversified strategy, like the one we employ with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, think about the potential long-term performance for your portfolio if you integrated 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock? Returning to the “change”: The alterations in fundamental aspects like valuation, revenue, and margins carry with them a narrative related to business and investor sentiment. Below, we have pinpointed significant developments that impacted the stock price movements for META stock. As a quick background: META offers products that allow users to connect and share through various devices, including mobile phones, PCs, VR headsets, wearables, and augmented reality, promoting connectivity anytime and anywhere. Opinion: Currently, we view META stock as fairly valued. Why is that the case? Take a look at the full narrative. Read Buy or Sell META Stock to understand what informs our current viewpoint. Risk: Nonetheless, META is not immune to significant declines. It dropped approximately 43% during the 2018 correction, 35% amid the Covid pandemic, and sustained a heavier blow of 77% during the inflation crisis. Despite all the positives surrounding the stock, real risks remain. When markets sour, META can still experience serious downturns. Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor, particularly given the volatility linked to a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven record of surpassing the S&P 500 during the past 4-year period. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a steadier performance, as evidenced in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: AVGO Stock AI Jackpot: $51B Shareholder Returns
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/14/avgo-stock-ai-jackpot-51b-shareholder-returns/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T15:40:46Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past decade, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has returned an impressive $51 billion to its investors through direct cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-focused strategy has delivered extraordinary results in 2025, with the stock posting a remarkable 50% year-to-date return, dramatically outperforming the broader market and establishing AVGO as one of the year’s most compelling semiconductor investments despite recent volatility. See – What’s Behind The Surge In Broadcom’s Stock? – for more details. Broadcom's commitment to consistent income generation continues through its steady quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share, maintaining an annualized dividend of $2.36 that yields approximately 0.68%, with the company successfully sustaining 13 consecutive years of dividend increases since becoming a public company. The semiconductor giant's robust capital allocation was significantly amplified in April 2025 when the board authorized a massive $10 billion share repurchase program running through December 31, 2025, reflecting management's confidence in the company's strong cash flow generation and its dominant position in AI infrastructure and mission-critical software. Broadcom’s exceptional financial performance has been underpinned by robust revenue growth, with Q3 2025 revenues reaching $16 billion and generating an impressive free cash flow of $7 billion (44% of revenue), while Q4 guidance of $17.4 billion represents a 24% year-over-year increase driven by accelerating demand for AI semiconductors and infrastructure software solutions. Let’s examine some statistics and evaluate how this payout capability compares to the market’s leading capital-return powerhouses. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock? Interestingly, AVGO stock ranks as the 53rd largest return to shareholders in history. Why should you care? This is because dividends and share buybacks signify direct and tangible returns of capital to investors. They also indicate management’s confidence in the company’s financial well-being and its capacity to generate sustainable cash flows. Furthermore, there are numerous other stocks with similar characteristics. Below is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by the total capital returned to investors via dividends and stock repurchases. For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What do you observe here? The overall capital returned to investors as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely related to growth potential for reinvestments. Companies such as Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding at a quicker pace, in a more predictable manner, compared to others, yet they have delivered a significantly lower percentage of their market valuation to stockholders. That’s the downside to substantial capital returns. While they are appealing, one must reflect on the question: Am I forfeiting growth and robust fundamentals? Keeping that in perspective, let’s analyze some figures for AVGO. (see Buy or Sell Broadcom Stock for further details) Nonetheless, AVGO isn’t immune to significant declines. It experienced a drop of nearly 48% during the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 35% in the 2021 inflation shock, and around 27% in the 2018 correction. Even with robust fundamentals, it’s apparent that the stock can endure substantial setbacks when the market shifts. Quality companies still suffer when investor sentiment changes dramatically. However, the risk isn't restricted to considerable market declines. Stocks can decrease even when markets are favorable – consider events such as earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. To understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp downturns in the past, read AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Buy CRWD Stock At $500?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CrowdStrike stock (NASDAQ: CRWD) has climbed 12% over the past month, fueled by optimism following its mid-September investor day. At that event, the company issued long-term guidance that exceeded analyst expectations, projecting net new Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth of at least 20% in fiscal year 2027 and setting a target of $10 billion in ARR by FY2031. Given this strong guidance and the company’s robust operating performance and financial condition, we believe there isn’t much to worry about regarding CRWD stock. The primary concern, however, is its very high valuation, which makes the stock seem relatively expensive following the recent run-up. Here is our multi-factor evaluation to determine if it’s still a buy. That is one perspective on stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses much more and is structured to minimize stock-specific risk while providing upside exposure. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock? Let’s delve into details of each of the evaluated factors, but prior to that, for quick background: With $127 Bil in market cap, CrowdStrike offers cloud-delivered security for endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, and data through its subscription-based Falcon platform and cloud modules via direct sales and channel partners. This table illustrates how CRWD is valued compared to the broader market. For further details see: CRWD Valuation Ratios This table shows how CRWD is growing relative to the broader market. For additional details see: CRWD Revenue Comparison This table highlights how CRWD's profitability compares to the broader market. For more details see: CRWD Operating Income Comparison CRWD experienced an effect slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We determine this based on both (a) how considerably the stock declined and, (b) how swiftly it recovered. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic However, the risk isn't confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even when markets are performing well – consider events like earnings reports, business updates, or changes in outlook.

Title: Tim Ferriss at a Career Crossroads: How Should He Shape His Next Chapter?
URL: https://hbr.org/podcast/2025/10/tim-ferriss-at-a-career-crossroads-how-should-he-shape-his-next-chapter
Time Published: 2025-10-14T15:15:00Z
Full Content:
Author, podcaster, and angel investor Tim Ferriss considers what to do next to meet his career and life goals. In April 2024, writer, podcaster, and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss—known for his hugely popular podcast “The Tim Ferriss Show” and NYT-bestselling books like The 4-Hour Workweek—found himself at a crossroads. Although his podcast was generating millions annually, he questioned the sustainability of podcasting and his own competitive advantage given the increasingly saturated market and the advent of AI tools and video-centric formats. Plus, he had built his career on anticipating cultural shifts in knowledge work, health, and media consumption while making early angel investments in companies like Uber, Shopify, Facebook, and Twitter. But his podcast’s reliable cash flow also funded his science-focused foundation, so making any shifts would be very consequential. He faced a difficult choice: innovate from within his proven format, pivot to entirely new ventures—possibly in film, premium consumer products, or venture capital—or risk a slow decline by maintaining the status quo. Complicating matters further was Ferriss’s desire to start a family, a goal he prioritized above all business ventures. Every month of indecision narrowed his window for successfully transitioning. Senior Lecturer Reza Satchu and Tim Ferriss joined Cold Call host Brian Kenny to discuss the case, “Tim Ferriss: What Might This Look Like If It Were Easy?” in front of a live audience on October 7, 2025 in Harvard Business School’s Klarman Hall auditorium. Using “The Founder Mindset” framework from the course created by Satchu, they explore testing assumptions, calibrating risk, and how to choose the next path in the face of multiple options—which can often lead to inaction. BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, the podcast where we dive deep into the stories behind groundbreaking Harvard Business School case studies. Tim Ferriss has been called the Oprah of Audio. His podcast, the Tim Ferriss Show, surpassed a billion downloads and reshaped the digital media landscape. Yet at the height of his success, Ferriss found himself at a crossroads. With podcasting becoming a crowded competitive space, he wondered whether the medium that had defined his career was still the best vehicle for his curiosity, creativity, and impact. How should a creator who has always thrived by reinventing himself decide what’s next? Especially when personal priorities, like starting a family, collide with professional ambitions. Today, on Cold Call, I’m joined by Professor Reza Satchu and case protagonist Tim Ferriss to discuss the case, “Tim Ferriss, What Might This Look Like If It Were Easy?” I’m your host Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to a live taping of Cold Call coming to you from Klarman Hall on the campus of HBS, Harvard Business School. Make some noise, folks. All right, can we have a warm welcome for our guests? Reza Satchu teaches entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School, including the Founder Mindset and Founder Launch, both courses that he created. He is also a serial entrepreneur, having founded multiple highly successful ventures. Reza, welcome. REZA SATCHU: Thank you very much. Thanks for having us. BRIAN KENNY: Tim Ferriss, the subject of today’s case is a bestselling author, entrepreneur, speaker, and early stage investor. You may have heard that he hosts a podcast. Tim, welcome. TIM FERRISS: Thanks. Thanks for having me. Hi, everybody. BRIAN KENNY: It’s great to have you here. I’m a little nervous actually because your podcast gets a lot of listens, so I want to make sure that we do this right. TIM FERRISS: I’m sure you’ll be fine. You have a better voice for radio. We were both commenting, the intonation and delivery. I thought it was so good. I was like, man. BRIAN KENNY: Why don’t we just dive right in? Reza, I’m going to start with you. Can you tell us what drew you to Tim’s story? Why did you think it was a good subject for a case study, particularly for the Founder’s Mindset class, and what makes it particularly relevant for aspiring founders today? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, so look, I think I was thrilled. Actually, my research associate who’s here, Denise Koller, came up with the idea of interviewing Tim. Initially, I thought, “Does this make sense?” The more I got to know Tim and study his work, his mindset is exactly in sync with some of the things that we’re trying to get our founders to think about, starting with, he imagines a world that doesn’t exist today. He imagines that there are things he can do that are different than are existing today. He imagines a space where he can actually think about something, take a series of actions, trust his judgment, and hopefully build something of consequence. So many people stop at that first point, which is, how could I possibly do something different? It started really there, where I thought, “Here’s someone who has done many different things well, trusted his judgment.” Really, that’s a key part of being a founder. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Tim, let me turn to you the case. Like any good HBS case, it opens up with you thinking pensively about what you’re going to do. You’re probably staring out a window looking at something. I’m wondering, actually, if you can take us back to where the case opens up, where you’re mulling through what your options are. You’ve got a lot of options right now and you’re thinking about what the best thing is. What was going on, what was your mindset at that time? TIM FERRISS: Yeah, I was actually literally looking out, in Austin where I recorded my podcast. I would say fundamentally it was, number one, has this become a crowded red ocean where other people can do this, what I started off doing in 2014. If there are one or more people who can do what I can do, I’m like, “Well, this seems redundant.” I would prefer to do something that is more of a category of one, to borrow from the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing. There wasn’t a financial pressure to stop. Certainly, there was a little bit of pressure to continue because it funds the foundation, it funds the angel investing, it pays for the bills and employees and so on. But it was more a question of, is this the game I want to play? We’re all playing games past a certain point, past the lowest rungs on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Then, beyond that, it’s being aware of what game you’ve currently opted into, what are the rules, what are the wind conditions, the failure modes. Then, authoring something that hopefully stacks the deck in your favor. That’s a lot of what I was thinking about. The entire landscape had become too saturated. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, and so you described this in the case as blue oceans versus red oceans. Reza, if you can talk about, in the Founder Mindset framework, how does Tim’s approach to pattern recognition and assumption testing compare to other founders? REZA SATCHU: I think there’s a critically important point on Tim’s mindset, and how I think it resonates with the Founder Mindset, is people think of committing to an idea as jumping off a cliff into shark-infested waters, and that somehow being a founder is full of risk, full of uncertainty. You close your eyes and you just hope and pray for the best. Okay, I can’t tell you how flawed that is. I’m a serial founder. I will tell you I think about risk all the time. I calculate risk and I’m not paralyzed by it. The key is actually making decisions in the face of risk. What Tim does with what he calls these assumptions or these experiments, he effectively is trusting his judgment to do some things. Nothing terribly consequential, but enough to get data to figure out whether or not he should continue pursuing his curiosity. He gives himself permission to go down a pathway of his curiosity, whereas, most people never give themselves that permission because they just think, “How could I possibly have this idea when others have so many more resources?” I call it “small c commitments.” He calls it these “two-week experiments,” but it’s this idea that he’s willing to suspend disbelief that others haven’t thought of this idea, and that he’s willing to actually test his ideas and dip his toe in before he jumps in. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Tim, for you, a lot of this began back when you wrote The 4-Hour Work Week, was that 15 years ago, give or take? TIM FERRISS: Almost 20, 2007, back when I had hair. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, that book challenged a lot of assumptions at that time. I’m wondering what assumptions you were testing as you wrote that book, and how do you weigh the risks and opportunities of coming out with something that seems a little audacious? TIM FERRISS: The first part I would say is simply asking questions that address some of the assumptions underlying traditional, let’s just call it, or conventional career planning. The deferred life plan. What would you do if you could not do that? If you could not rely on that. Which by the way is more and more relevant with some of the technologies that are coming. But if you couldn’t rely on that, exactly, as a social contract, what would you do? Then, it just led into lots of my own experiments. That was largely autobiographical. Then, teasing out the principles that allowed me to automate, and at the time use virtual assistants, that would be replaced by a lot of AI right now. That’s the first part. It was testing assumptions, but not just in a theoretical capacity. It was saying, “All right, I tried this thing, it didn’t work. I did this, it did work. I did this, it kind of worked, and here’s how I got it to really work. Here’s how you might think about dipping your toe in the water.” One critical part of that book that I think sometimes gets missed is cultivating a bias towards action. There are these exercises at the end of almost every chapter called Comfort Challenges. It’s just doing things that are very uncomfortable socially. There’s really no risk involved. This is not from the book, but my friend Noah Kagan talks about the Coffee Challenge, where people have to go in, order a coffee, and then ask for 10% off without giving any explanation, and just like, deal with that. It’s amazing. You see these people are like multiple-time founders or HBS grads, they’re pacing. They’re like, “Oh, it’s easy.” They’re pacing around the coffee shop for 30 minutes trying to build up the courage to do it. It’s like, “Yeah, that stuff helps.” From realizing that most stumbles or non-issues to begin with. In terms of presenting something that was contrarian, I first of all pitched the book. It’s a long story as to how I even got to the book, because I never wanted to write a book, but it was turned down by something like 29 publishers, violently. Some of the rejection letters were worthy of framing. Then, Steve Ross and Heather Jackson, at Crown, which was an imprint of Random House at the time, my pitch had been polished after getting rejected 29 times, literally, this is not an exaggeration. They were like, “Sure, kid. We’ll pay you pennies on the dollar to try this.” Their downside risk was very low. I had, as a younger person, I was published when I was 29, but at that time it’s like, what are your advantages? You can take stock of your advantage. At that time, it’s time, it’s speed, experimentation. You don’t have some permanent record of strikes that follows you around everywhere. I think you can afford to experiment. For me, it was ultimately an exercise in writing a book, and the only time it started to click was when I basically wrote it as I would write an email to two very particular friends after two glasses of wine. I threw out two drafts of that book, and then it unfolded, and that bought me permission to do a lot of other things. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, it worked out in the end, didn’t it? TIM FERRISS: It did work out. It’s not the end yet, so we’ll see. BRIAN KENNY: Reza, I had a chance to sit in on your class today, which was really interesting, and thank you for letting me do that. You talked a lot about failure, particularly in the beginning part of the class. What’s the Founder’s Mindset where it comes to being able to get rejected 29 times and still go back and ask for another publishing deal? REZA SATCHU: Okay, so first of all, just on failure, I think human psychology, is you often overestimate your downside, and I think to Tim’s point, you also massively underestimate your ability to recover. People imagine failure as this terrible thing that, oh my God, if this happens, it will be awful. Certainly, sitting here with the HBS students, what you’re doing is looking left and right and wondering, “Oh, my God, these people are going to think I’m a failure.” When in reality they’re barely going to think about you at all, but people are really stressed about that. I think the broader component around failure is not only do you overestimate what failure is, but by not putting yourself in positions of failure, two things don’t happen. One is you don’t learn. You don’t learn what happens through that failure. But the second thing is, I don’t know if this is what happened here, but people actually, when they look at someone who has stayed committed 29 times, I have this phrase which is like, magic happens when you commit, which is it’s not just you learn what you’re capable of. Other people show up precisely because they see the commitment. What people often misprice is that piece of the right tail upside. I think failure is a wonderful thing. I think a life without failure is a terrible life. It’s just a life where you don’t learn what you’re capable of. I think there needs to be a fundamental reframing of failure. Tim, I’d love you to talk about your concept of these one-way doors, irreversible law, like how you price risk, what does risk actually mean to you? TIM FERRISS: Yeah, I can speak to that. I also want to add something I left out of the question around The 4-Hour Work Week. There we go. I’ll let you take it. Just because people are rejecting your idea does not mean it’s a good idea. Just to state the obvious. REZA SATCHU: That’s true. TIM FERRISS: I agree with Paul Graham, Co-Founder of Y Combinator, who wrote an essay roughly around, the more labels you apply to yourself, the dumber you are. If you pride yourself on being contrarian, you’re actually just conforming to an anti-consensus. You’re actually still suffering from a really heavy form of bias. In my case, the reason I persisted through those 29 rejections was that the material that was going to be in the book, I had workshopped with, I don’t know, a thousand students at Princeton doing guest lectures at the invitation of my former professor. I had refined it, refined it like a stand-up comedian working on his 60-minute set, and I knew it worked. REZA SATCHU: Right, so you had an informational advantage. TIM FERRISS: I asked for feedback forms after every class. I had all these annoying pointed questions that students didn’t want to fill out. I knew that for a particular demographic it worked, and that’s why I persisted. If I had not had that data, I don’t think I would’ve persisted. I wouldn’t have had any grounds for plowing head in that way. Then, in terms of risk, I think there’s a lot to be said. I’m echoing Scott Galloway here, but choosing where you’re going to live and operate actually is a really important, sometimes more so than what you’re going to do. Moving to Silicon Valley was incredibly liberating because people fail all the time and they’re never counted out. I’ve invested in so many founders who failed the first time and then, boom. REZA SATCHU: Back at it. TIM FERRISS: Right? StumbleUpon, I was an advisor, didn’t work out. That was a zero for me as an advisor. But then, Garrett Camp a few months later was like, “Hey, I have this idea.” Turned it into Uber. People are never counted out. Being in an environment where that is the case matters a lot. It doesn’t have to be Silicon Valley, although that’s the most obvious. Risk for me, put simply, would be the probability of an irreversible negative outcome. There are some cases where that’s part of the calculus, but typically, I thought about making a journal. I seriously contemplated doing this because everyone’s making a journal now, but I went to the bookstore, I was like, “There are too many journals, I’m not going to do it.” But the journal was going to be called “worries that mostly didn’t happen.” It’s just like you just write down what you’re worried about and then you look back three months later, and again, none of that actually mattered. The cost of “failure” is very low for most things. You can also get a signal, positive or negative, go or no-go, pretty quickly if you’re methodical about it. I try to view, reframe failure, as scientific feedback. You have a hypothesis, you test it, it didn’t pan out, still valuable. If you’re optimizing for learning and relationships that transcend any given project, experiment, company, job, et cetera, those things snowball over time. If you’re keen on doing short-term experiments but long-term greedy, it’s very hard to lose, in my opinion. From what I’ve seen, and this is based on Silicon Valley, so it’s maybe anomalous, but it’s really hard to fail over the long term. REZA SATCHU: The amazing thing about this failure point is if you just think about two different career trajectories, one is a more traditional career trajectory. Let’s pick on consultants because, why not? There’s no real risk of failure. You’re going to get 95 things out of a hundred right on that path. On the Founder path, you are getting most things wrong. You’re asking people for money, they’re saying no. You’re asking customers to transact with you, they’re saying no. You’re trying to hire people, they’re saying no. You’ve got no resources. You’re constantly surrounded by a life of failure. You’ve just got to decide which life sounds better. What you suddenly realize is, wow, well, a life without failure, it’s hard to imagine having the impact that you all want to have, or having the return that you all want to have. I really think this point around risk really ties into failure, which is first of all, you need to reframe risk as a really great thing. Without risk, there’s no return. Risk is a good thing. It is not what you immediately think of, which is, “Oh, I want to stay away from it.” You need risk. Okay? What that doesn’t mean is that you’re jumping off a cliff. What it means is you understand how to operate in terms of risk. You need to incorporate some of the frameworks that you’ve talked about in class today to measure and calibrate it. But Tim’s not writing these books if he’s not willing to encounter risk. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, the 4-Hour Body, still recovering from some injuries from that one, 2010. Just had a surgery on this elbow as a result of that book. REZA SATCHU: Everyone must have thought that was a crazy idea. TIM FERRISS: It was crazy. But to use the 4-Hour Body as an example, the 4-Hour Work Week bought me permission to experiment outside of that lane, and so I did the 4-Hour Body in totally different category. Because the upside of that was so high if it opened the door to me writing books on any subject. The downside was that book doesn’t do well, and I go back to milking this 4-Hour, whatever the hell work week. The downside risk was very, very limited. I would also say that I think my experience with great schools, my experience with analytical people in general, is that they’re very good at thinking about all the possible downsides of doing the new thing or doing the “risky thing”. But they don’t spend as much time thinking about the cost of inaction or the status quo or taking the safe route. If you telescope out six months, a year, three years, five years, what are the emotional costs, financial, maybe relational, et cetera. It turns out when you start to look at these two options with equal weight, that the potentially safer route is just as fraught with all sort of problems as the supposedly risky route. Then, it’s like, “All right, I might as well do the weird thing first.” BRIAN KENNY: Did you ever worry about your brand though, the Tim Ferriss brand? If I do something that’s too contrarian, I may lose some of my brand cachet. TIM FERRISS: I don’t think about brand really at all, which isn’t to fault anyone who does, but I think brand is one of those words that can be a siren song for lots of decisions that compromise. I don’t want to say necessarily integrity and values, although it can be that, but you can be captured by, in my case, like an audience who rewards you for your most outlandish comments. If you follow that incentive structure on something like YouTube, you can wear a mask for so long that you become that mask. I’ve seen that happen to people, and you can’t hit control Z on that very easily, so I don’t think about brand. I pay a lot of attention to truly following my curiosity. When I do say a six, I do these two week experiments, but they’re generally within the context of a six to 12-month project. When I’m in that six to 12-month project, I am all in. I am completely saturated in it. I just find that there are a lot of ways to approach this. There’s no one way for everybody, but most of the hiccups along the way are just little toe stubs. But you have to get used to taking the hits. In other words, it’s like, if you were to go to a boxing class and you’ve never done boxing before and you get hit in the liver with a punch, it’s not even a hard punch. It’s going to be really shocking and unpleasant. If you do it for six months, you’ll be like, “Okay, yeah, I’m going to get 50 of these today. It’s fine.” You get over it, but you have to train your immune response, your stress response to this stuff. The only way to do that is by getting out there and trying stuff. REZA SATCHU: Brian, this is what’s so valuable to Founders, is exactly this, which is what they’re getting is hit all the time, but they’re learning that they can recover much faster through those hits. TIM FERRISS: Yeah. Could I add one more thing? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, of course. TIM FERRISS: I’ll give you an example. I remember the first time that I got, sadly, this is just a tax in the US, my first frivolous lawsuit, I got sued by somebody who was completely, it’s laughably ridiculous. I was so stressed out, I couldn’t sleep, and my publisher was involved, all this craziness. It was filed by the law firm that sued Subway for having 11 and a half inch foot long subs. So I’m dealing with all this and it’s tearing me up inside. Then, I was having a conversation with this friend of mine who’s been on multiple public boards. He’s in private equity for a super long time, very, very good investor. He’s like, “What?” He’s like, “This is the first time you’ve been sued.” He’s like, “I should sue you.” He’s like, “Welcome to the club.” He’s like, “What are you so upset about?” I was like, “What are you talking about?” I tried to justify it, and he’s like, “Ah. It’s fine.” I was like, “Oh, okay.” You just realize that a lot of the things you might contemplate now that you think are very big, huge problems, you can fix. A lot of it is just par for the course. REZA SATCHU: What do you think of this right to recover or what do you think human psychology is around recovery? Do people underestimate or overestimate their ability to recover? TIM FERRISS: I think it depends a lot on who you’re talking to, right? It’s like, if we’re talking to a bunch of refugees who had made hard choices. Then, I would say they probably accurately estimate their adaptiveness. REZA SATCHU: Ability. Yeah. TIM FERRISS: Their ability to adapt. I would say people who have, and this was me for a long time, executed to plan in a system where the rules are known, it’s more or less complete information, like higher education. It’s like, “Okay, great, you’re on the dean’s list, you’re summa cum laude, or whatever.” That those people underestimate their resilience, but I don’t actually think they’re wrong, because to develop the resilience you have to build some scar tissue. The only way you do that is by getting on the field. This sounds all abstract. It’s like, “No, okay, you want to change the world and build a billion-dollar company doing X?” It’s like, “All right, go talk to 10, go pitch 10 customers next week and ask them for money. As a dry run to get prepayment that will fund X, Y, or Z.” But don’t hide, and then I’m quoting Seth Godin, “But don’t hide behind the big.” Get out there and it’s going to be messy. BRIAN KENNY: Reza, I want to talk, so much of the case centers around optionality and all the options that Tim had in front of him, we talked about that a little bit upfront. I’m wondering, once you’ve achieved a certain level of success, a lot of opportunities open up. As a Founder, how do you sort through that? How do you think about what’s worth pursuing, what you shouldn’t pursue? What’s the thought process there? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, so it’s interesting. In my life, as someone who’s founded a few businesses, in some ways, the most recent businesses are harder, surprisingly. One would say, “Well, it’s easier because you’ve got more resources, more expertise, you have less hunger, and you have much more options. It’s not as critical that it has to succeed.” I teach and I found a business at the same time. That’s crazy. Most people would say that is not an optimal way to found a business. Whereas, my first couple of businesses, there’s no way I’d be teaching and founding a business. I’d be fully focused on founding. I think this idea that it gets easier, it might get easier from an expertise perspective, but suddenly you’ve got what I call the curse of optionality, which is you’ve got a number, and Tim, you’re facing some of this right now, frankly, this paradox of choice, which is precisely because of the success you’ve had you’ve got a whole bunch of choices. He mentioned Seth Godin, who’s a wonderful writer, who we interviewed for the case, and he said to Denise and me that we need to lock Tim in a room or in a cabin, and he needs to pick an option. Of course, what he was saying was that the world will be a much better place if Tim commits to something. As opposed to maximizing all of his options. I do think this curse, and for the students, people listening, I think that many of you will fall into this trap of preserving options for far too long and not knowing what you’re capable of when you commit. I’ve not had money and I’ve had money. Not having money is somewhat liberating because you just know what you need to do. When you have options, and those options could be a Harvard Business School degree, you suddenly start thinking, “Well, maybe I can preserve those options for a very long time.” I’m curious, Tim, I would ask you this question, which is you’ve got a whole bunch of options ahead of you. Here’s what I know to be true, is if you committed to one, I’m sure it will be far more impactful than if you preserve all of them. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, that’s true. I agree with that, but I would also say a few things. Number one is that you can validate or invalidate something really quickly. We were talking about this a bit earlier, but I was chatting with a student who was talking about maybe the safer route to finance and then less safe perhaps in entertainment, film potentially. I was saying, I’m saying, “All right, you know what’s going to really get attention, is if you’re an HBS grad who offers to shadow a show runner or a producer in pre-production on a movie, and you’re like, “Nothing is beneath me. Cleaning toilets, getting your coffee, I don’t care.'” It’s like, “All I want to do is observe some deal making and see what goes into making a film.” It’s like, “You can figure out if that is actually your dream or not very, very quickly. You might be completely allergic to it, but you can figure that out after a week of being in the pre-production office.” That’s number one. REZA SATCHU: But are you also suggesting that because that’s a differentiator, meaning, there’s something that it says about you, that you’re willing to do that? TIM FERRISS: Here’s my experience. Even though you might feel there’s very little time and a big rush, there’s not a big rush. You can take time to have these little detours and try things. The second is that even though I’m doing some different things, let’s just say angel investing newsletter foundation focused on mental health therapeutics, nonprofit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. There’s actually a way in which they reinforce one another. I will use, say, the podcast to interview scientists based on science I’m interested in to determine if I think they’re a good candidate for the foundation, or potentially, it doesn’t have to be a scientist. If I find that their personality is compatible enough and their idea is compelling enough that I want to make an investment in their company. I can use that as a discovery mechanism then for sourcing. I would say, also it depends on how much… Preserving all of your options also is just an illusion. You can’t really do that. The nature of making a decision, it’s like incision, decision to cut away. You are by definition cutting off a lot of paths, which I do for six to 12 months at a time. But you can have a few things, in my case, running at the same time in parallel. I would say optionality might not be all you think it is. If I look at hundreds of people I’ve interviewed on the podcast who are by any measure top performers in their fields, one of the most common comments or concepts that comes up is the power of positive constraints. Positive constraints, commit. It doesn’t have to be commit forever. It shouldn’t probably be commit forever, unless you’re the person who knows at age five that you want to do X. If you’re that, I don’t know, maybe you wouldn’t be here. REZA SATCHU: Positive constraints means cutting off options, in some sense? TIM FERRISS: It means cutting off options, or it could be anything. If you’re writing, it could be a space or page constraint. It could be, I have to write this all in third person or first person. REZA SATCHU: Well, it’s also your comment around, if I’ve got a problem, I will only solve it by taking something away. TIM FERRISS: Right, so in the case of the podcast, I found myself starting to drag my feet because it’s a very saturated marketplace. One of my key advantages that I had early on, besides just starting pretty early in 2014, was my research and the ability that I had to dig and find things that were interesting. Now, you can go in ChatGPT and say, “Give me 10 questions in the style of Tim Ferriss or Lex Friedman or Joe Rogan interviewing this person.” Boom, you’ll get good answers. That advantage has effectively disappeared, and there are a lot of ways to potentially respond to that. But for me, number one, I’m generally not looking for the cutting edge. I’m looking for dull edge. I want to see some proof of concept before I do angel investing or before I do some hare-brained thing, like make a card game, which some of you may have or not. That’s sitting up at the top for anybody who wants a copy. I think that fundamentally a lot of it comes down to asking yourself, how do you maximize for… I know this is, again, it’s so simple, but if you maximize for learning and relationships that transcend whatever that single project or job is, this is particularly effective if you are in a place like San Francisco. I don’t want to sell San Francisco. It’s pretty dirty and filthy. But I think if you were going to choose projects and you decided as a thought exercise to rank order the parameters as who, like who am I directly observing and working with? Then, where, and then what/sector, that actually comes last, I think you could end up with some pretty interesting options on the menu. BRIAN KENNY: We haven’t talked about impact, but I know that’s an important part of the thing that you cover in Founder’s Mindset. Can you talk a little bit about the idea of thinking about impact at the outset and not at the end of the journey? REZA SATCHU: I think so many people fall into this trap. I think I fell into this trap early in my career, which is my life is going to be in these stages. The impact stage will be that last piece of my life when I’ve learned a lot, when I’ve had the benefit of resources, all these sorts of things. The problem is there’s two problems. One is you may or may not be around for that last piece. BRIAN KENNY: Never know. REZA SATCHU: But the second point is it turns out that actually having impact along the way, and I love the way you describe it, which is start with the small things. Start with the people in your life that you’re… We all have these, especially here, have these visions of grandeur around having massive impact. Well, I’d say the most important way to do that is to actually start living a life of impact right away and on the small things. I think that, Tim, when you talk about, so what I view learning, what I view learning as, because a lot of people talk about you want to maximize learning, which I completely agree, and I’d be curious how you define learning. Okay, so I’m going to propose what my definition of learning is, and you tell me whether this, because I think it’s an important concept because learning is… If you had to say, what is the thing that is going to most correlate with impact, it would be learning. He who learns, he or she who learns the most is going to attract the most credibility, resources such that they can have the impact that they most desperately want. I define learning in the age of AI as the spot where you’re making… it’s all about decision making. Meaning, the trait we are most trying to learn is judgment. Judgment occurs when you’re making consequential decisions that you’re accountable for. You must live a life where you’re pushing yourself to make decisions, some of which will be wrong, some of which will be right, in order to build the thing we most want, which is judgment. Okay, so I’m curious to know your thoughts about that. TIM FERRISS: Learning, there’s how to learn, and then there’s what to learn. If you’re looking at say, who to work with, and then the where, and then the what, right? There are certain skills that are not going to transfer. It’s like, okay, if you’re in the waste management business and you’re understanding the ins and outs of waste management, I’m just making that up because I like unsexy stuff, that may not transfer to your hot shot AI startup for whatever, customer service. But if you are observing, this is an old school example, like a Wayne Huizenga. REZA SATCHU: Yeah, Wayne Huizenga. They don’t know who Wayne Huizenga is. TIM FERRISS: I know. REZA SATCHU: You and I know who Wayne Huizenga is. TIM FERRISS: I know, waste management, then Blockbuster, which went extinct back in the Pleistocene era, but that guy was a master deal maker. If you’re able to watch someone acquiring dozens and dozens of companies, and how that entire dance is woven, that transfers. If you’re learning how to communicate, let’s just say, I’m making this up, you work for Cards Against Humanity. This is a very popular game as some of you may know, they were really, really good at PR stunts. If you work at that company when it is small and you’re involved with all of those PR stunts, which fundamentally are thinking about positioning and differentiation, that will apply to everything. It’s just asking yourself, where could this transfer? Where could this apply? Then, that’s the stuff that you focus on. For me, it’s in a sense meta skills, that if you were to copy and paste, you take somebody, look, it doesn’t matter. Well, I’ll give you actually maybe a more contemporary example, like Jeff Bezos. All right. What is Jeff Bezos’ superpower? I would say that it is having longer time horizons than almost everybody else, and defending and justifying and reiterating that in every shareholder letter. He trained Wall Street like a domesticated puppy, like a puppy. REZA SATCHU: From day one, yeah. TIM FERRISS: Talk about just incredible persuasion and the pro sleight of hand and also just business mastery. But the point is, if you have a longer time horizon than other people, that’s a huge competitive advantage also in and of itself. If you can be around someone who exemplifies that, because I can say that, and you’re like, “Okay, I got it.” But it’s like, do you really? You need to see how that is emphasized over and over again. Or, like a Herb Kelleher at Southwest. Would I have loved to have worked for that guy? Would I have quit my tech job to work for him? Absolutely, because such a maniacal focus on being the low cost airline. I remember he was interviewed at one point and he said to the journalists, because they were saying how hard it was, what he did, and he’s like, “No, you can do my job.” Then, he’s like, “All right, give me a situation.” They gave him a situation. He’s like, “All right, does that help us to be the low cost airline or not?” They’re like, “No.” He’s like, “Yeah, that’s a no.” He’s like, “Okay, next one.” He’s like, “Yeah.” If you have the focus, but you need to be around people who are doing that and living it so you can see it in different contexts. This is going to sound bizarre because I’m thinking about adopting another dog. But there’s an expression in dog training, which is basically if the dog hasn’t done it, say a behavior, shaping a behavior in 20 different locations, 20 different durations, they don’t have that behavior. It’s not durable. Humans are the same. It’s conditioning. Having the opportunity to work with someone where you see certain characteristics exemplified; certain behaviors, certain principles enacted that can be applied to different businesses, man, I think that’s an incredible shortcut. But you and I have different perspectives on this. I think working for a startup’s a fantastic way to learn on someone else’s dime with the understanding that- BRIAN KENNY: That’s our youngest audience member, by the way. TIM FERRISS: Yeah. Start them young. Start them young. REZA SATCHU: It’s true. What I’d say, I think just, look, I think the question is, in the age of AI, what are the traits that we can teach people? I think that the challenge is that things like memorization and observation are far less valuable. What is valuable is this elusive thing called judgment. The real question is, how do we get it? I think, yeah, you can get it by watching someone else, but how you really get it is by doing it yourself. Actually being in the arena, making those decisions. One of the things you said, Tim, which is very interesting to me, because I have a similar phrase, when you said you have a bias for action. I have a phrase which is, if in doubt, act, which immediately people say, “Well, wait, Reza, you don’t know what you’re doing, you’re going to act?” No, the reason I say that is because so many people are paralyzed by imperfect or uncertain information, and so they’re like deer in headlights. What I suggest is, even if you’re going to stay the course, train yourself to make a decision that you’re actually staying the course, which is a bias for action. I’m curious how you think about, bias for action is, it feels risky. I’m curious how you view that. TIM FERRISS: What I would say is I have a tendency… My mom literally got me a shirt that says, ”Wait a second, let me overthink this.” My tendency is to, I don’t want to say perseverate, but over consider the ramifications of a lot of decisions. It’s been a practice of conditioning myself to be like, all right, what if I tried what Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and so on has done, where he wants to enable his chief of staff to act quickly enough that they roughly get things wrong 10% of the time. That’s literally a guideline that he uses with his chief of staff. He says 10% footfall, which is a little confusing because it’s a tennis reference. Anyway, but I think applying that to your own life where you’re like, all right, what can I put on automatic, just no decision autopilot default, number one, where can I just completely remove decisions? Sometimes that’s with diet, exercise. You don’t want to get up in the morning and decide which of 20 toothpaste tubes you’re going to use. You have your toothpaste and you just deal with your toothpaste. Similarly, you could extrapolate that and apply it to giving employees autonomous decision-making power and creating a culture where you actually reward screw-ups. I literally met with, I was having a blood draw this morning because I’m in Boston for proteomics assay. Anyway, it’s a long story. But they have a dedicated discord within the company for celebrating bleep-ups basically. That are not egregious. It’s also like, all right, how do we not do this again? But people get rewarded for ambition, mistakes of ambition, not mistakes of sloth, which is straight from Machiavelli, so I’m not sure how I feel about that. But in any case, I don’t know about also… I got stuck on the AI stuff again, because I don’t know, I wish I could give everybody and myself a strategy for making yourself AI proof. I don’t know what that looks like. I think though you can make a decision about, am I going to use these tools or am I going to stick my head in the sand and try to find a way around them? I think probably the way to go for it is spend your evenings for two weeks vibe coding and messing around with AI, so that you have some idea of how you might utilize it. Because within two or three years, we’re going to have multi-billion dollar companies or billion-dollar companies with one to three employees, I’m very confident in that. They’ll just use agents to fill a lot of roles, like CFO and so on. People are already doing this. I wouldn’t get too hung up on that. Although I would say, if I were to play the counterpoint, that the soft skills that I was mentioning earlier, negotiating, deal-making, this is a very intrinsically human interaction. REZA SATCHU: Human thing. TIM FERRISS: It’s very rare that you’re just going to be able to send pitch emails with the deal structure and you’re like, “Yes or no, thumbs up?” With this emoticon based on my AI chatbot, like, “Great. Let’s do a deal.” Typically, not how it works, especially as the stakes get bigger, which don’t mean they’re huge, that they’re just consequential for whoever you’re dealing with. That stuff I don’t see going away anytime soon. BRIAN KENNY: I want to give time. We’re coming close to the end of our time. I’ve got one more question for each of you, but before we do that, Tim, maybe you want to tell people about your latest venture? Because I think there are some takeaways, some giveaway items. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, if people want, so this is a very off menu thing. BRIAN KENNY: It’s just like the Oprah Show. You’re going to get something to take with you. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, exactly. It’s not a car, but it’s something else. I ended up collaborating with this guy, Elan Lee, who’s one of the world’s best game designers for the last two years to create a card game for off-screen social interaction. That’s my current project, is a card game of all things. I could explain why I chose that, but the biggest one was the who. This Elan Lee, where I was like, “I would pay to just hang out with this guy.” He’s such a soulful, deep thinker, who’s ethical and also happens to be a polymath, top 1% in multiple fields. I was like, “I just want to steep myself in whatever magic juju this guy has.” That’s how fundamentally I made the decision. Yeah, there are games up there, it’s called COYOTE. Then, beyond that, I do have an 800-page draft of a book. That’s not an overstatement. I’ll be whittling that down over the next six months probably. That’s been like eight years in the making. It’s been sitting back there for a long time. There’s other stuff going on. BRIAN KENNY: That’s awesome. Now, this has been a great conversation. I knew it would be. I was so excited to do this today. Before I let you go, I’ll ask the same question of each of you, and I’ll start with you, Tim, and I always give the professor the last word because it’s Harvard Business School, but it’s a pretty simple question. TIM FERRISS: Reza is pretty good at getting the last word anyway. BRIAN KENNY: I think that’s true. REZA SATCHU: That’s true. That is definitely BRIAN KENNY: If you just think about the case, you’ve lived it, what lessons do you think emerging founders should take from the case about navigating similar inflection points in their own journey? TIM FERRISS: Let’s see. I’m going to give credit to a mentor of mine named Ed Zschau. He was a professor of mine at Princeton, taught really the first entrepreneurship class that I’m aware of, “High-tech Entrepreneurship,” ELE 491. Still have all my notes from the class. He used to teach at HBS and then jump-started this entrepreneurship program at Princeton. He was congressman from Silicon Valley, former competitive figure skater, took a couple of companies public. Was one of the first, if not the first computer science teacher at Stanford, even though he had no computer science background. It was like somebody else dropped out and they’re like, “Can anybody else teach this class? He was like, “Oh, I’ll figure it out.” Back in the day. In his last class, I think I’m getting the name of this song right, but he actually gets up and he sings this song. I’m going to do it my way. The whole point is everybody’s making up everything by and large. There is no one right way to do it. I think that what I would hope people to take from my very bizarre case study, and I say that, I couldn’t have been prouder and happier with how everybody put it together, Denise and Reza and so on, is that you don’t have to follow the prescription, whatever the prescription is. You don’t have to meet the expectations, whatever the expectations are. You just don’t have to do it. There are a lot of ways to improvise and zig and zag. As long as you’re not too calcified around what you consider your identity. You just have to be really careful with painting yourself into a corner with that. That’s what I would hope people to take from it, is just there is a lot of room to improvise and maneuver. People ask me a lot, for instance, I’ve done these 800 plus interviews on the podcast, and they’re like, “What are the commonalities?” I’m like, “The greatest commonality is there are no commonalities.” It’s like for every incredible writer who gives me one set of advice, I sit in front of the screen, even if it’s blank for 10 hours a day, chained myself to the desk. To, B.J. Novak of The Office and movies and all sorts of stuff, he was like, “Yeah, I really need to get into the mood.” It’s like, “I’ll have my cappuccino, I’ll read the paper, I’ll do this thing. I really need to be in the right state to write.” They’re both doing amazing jobs, and they have diametrically opposing advice, which means you can figure out what rules and what stories work for you. I would just say mess around. You have your whole life to be safe and conservative and not politically. You get the idea. Like color within the lines. I guess you could have the rest of your life to be conservative too politically. But the point is, there will never, in my opinion, be a better time for you guys coming out of HBS to just embrace your weird self and try some of the stuff that is going to get harder to do later. REZA SATCHU: Look, I think that’s extremely well said. Tim, when we wrote this case study, in some ways it’s probably the longest case study because he’s got so many things going on. My students are probably like, “This is a 20-plus page story.” It’s everything from dancing, to an author, to podcasts, to all sorts of things. If I had to summarize it, I’d want two takeaways. One is, live a life full of curiosity and allow yourself to explore the things that you’re curious with. Whether that’s these experiments, small C commitments, just suspend disbelief and trust your judgment to actually explore things that you’re curious in. The upside is far greater than the downside. That’s the first point. The second point is, I really think Tim’s risk framework is very interesting. In some ways you hear a story and you immediately think, “Well, this guy is embracing risk at every turn.” It’s actually the opposite. He understands that he has to live a life with risk, but he’s actually thinking really hard about how to calibrate it. The way he does that is by actually understanding that his downside is nowhere near as bad as we all think it is. It’s defining his fears, which allows him to hopefully do something extraordinary because he’s shifting what the outcome could be. I think that is really, I would say those are, trust your curiosity and embrace risk, but calibrate it appropriately and understand that, especially coming out of a school like Harvard, your downside is nowhere near as bad as you think it is. TIM FERRISS: I’d love to add just a few things real quick. The risk mitigation stuff and thinking about that, if people are interested, I wrote these a long time ago, but it’s a two-part blog post series called How, I think it’s just “How I Created a Real World MBA.” Related to how I tiptoed my way into angel investing. REZA SATCHU: Well, this is your angel investing. TIM FERRISS: I think that’s worth, I think people in this room might find that an interesting read. The second is really study the outliers. Because if anyone has done it, there is the possibility that you could also do it or chart your own path. A book that you might not expect, it’s one called The Art of Possibility, I think the author’s last name, it’s by a husband and wife duo, Zander, Z-A-N-D-E-R. It’s very fast read, amazing book. There are a lot of book recommendations I could give, but that’s a fast one that I would encourage people to check out. Really study the outliers, like Yvon Chouinard, the early chapters, the early chapters, or if you think of someone who’s a risk-taker, like Richard Branson, read Losing My Virginity. It’s like at every turn that guy is hedging risk and minimizing and mitigating risk. It’s remarkable how good he is at capping downside. I would just say, study the outliers. There are a lot of ways to tiptoe into things to figure out a signal very, very quickly at low cost. BRIAN KENNY: I think that’s a good note to end on.

Title: Tim Ferriss at a Career Crossroads: How Should He Shape His Next Chapter?

Full Content:
Author, podcaster, and angel investor Tim Ferriss considers what to do next to meet his career and life goals. In April 2024, writer, podcaster, and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss—known for his hugely popular podcast “The Tim Ferriss Show” and NYT-bestselling books like The 4-Hour Workweek—found himself at a crossroads. Although his podcast was generating millions annually, he questioned the sustainability of podcasting and his own competitive advantage given the increasingly saturated market and the advent of AI tools and video-centric formats. Plus, he had built his career on anticipating cultural shifts in knowledge work, health, and media consumption while making early angel investments in companies like Uber, Shopify, Facebook, and Twitter. But his podcast’s reliable cash flow also funded his science-focused foundation, so making any shifts would be very consequential. He faced a difficult choice: innovate from within his proven format, pivot to entirely new ventures—possibly in film, premium consumer products, or venture capital—or risk a slow decline by maintaining the status quo. Complicating matters further was Ferriss’s desire to start a family, a goal he prioritized above all business ventures. Every month of indecision narrowed his window for successfully transitioning. Senior Lecturer Reza Satchu and Tim Ferriss joined Cold Call host Brian Kenny to discuss the case, “Tim Ferriss: What Might This Look Like If It Were Easy?” in front of a live audience on October 7, 2025 in Harvard Business School’s Klarman Hall auditorium. Using “The Founder Mindset” framework from the course created by Satchu, they explore testing assumptions, calibrating risk, and how to choose the next path in the face of multiple options—which can often lead to inaction. BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, the podcast where we dive deep into the stories behind groundbreaking Harvard Business School case studies. Tim Ferriss has been called the Oprah of Audio. His podcast, the Tim Ferriss Show, surpassed a billion downloads and reshaped the digital media landscape. Yet at the height of his success, Ferriss found himself at a crossroads. With podcasting becoming a crowded competitive space, he wondered whether the medium that had defined his career was still the best vehicle for his curiosity, creativity, and impact. How should a creator who has always thrived by reinventing himself decide what’s next? Especially when personal priorities, like starting a family, collide with professional ambitions. Today, on Cold Call, I’m joined by Professor Reza Satchu and case protagonist Tim Ferriss to discuss the case, “Tim Ferriss, What Might This Look Like If It Were Easy?” I’m your host Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to a live taping of Cold Call coming to you from Klarman Hall on the campus of HBS, Harvard Business School. Make some noise, folks. All right, can we have a warm welcome for our guests? Reza Satchu teaches entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School, including the Founder Mindset and Founder Launch, both courses that he created. He is also a serial entrepreneur, having founded multiple highly successful ventures. Reza, welcome. REZA SATCHU: Thank you very much. Thanks for having us. BRIAN KENNY: Tim Ferriss, the subject of today’s case is a bestselling author, entrepreneur, speaker, and early stage investor. You may have heard that he hosts a podcast. Tim, welcome. TIM FERRISS: Thanks. Thanks for having me. Hi, everybody. BRIAN KENNY: It’s great to have you here. I’m a little nervous actually because your podcast gets a lot of listens, so I want to make sure that we do this right. TIM FERRISS: I’m sure you’ll be fine. You have a better voice for radio. We were both commenting, the intonation and delivery. I thought it was so good. I was like, man. BRIAN KENNY: Why don’t we just dive right in? Reza, I’m going to start with you. Can you tell us what drew you to Tim’s story? Why did you think it was a good subject for a case study, particularly for the Founder’s Mindset class, and what makes it particularly relevant for aspiring founders today? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, so look, I think I was thrilled. Actually, my research associate who’s here, Denise Koller, came up with the idea of interviewing Tim. Initially, I thought, “Does this make sense?” The more I got to know Tim and study his work, his mindset is exactly in sync with some of the things that we’re trying to get our founders to think about, starting with, he imagines a world that doesn’t exist today. He imagines that there are things he can do that are different than are existing today. He imagines a space where he can actually think about something, take a series of actions, trust his judgment, and hopefully build something of consequence. So many people stop at that first point, which is, how could I possibly do something different? It started really there, where I thought, “Here’s someone who has done many different things well, trusted his judgment.” Really, that’s a key part of being a founder. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Tim, let me turn to you the case. Like any good HBS case, it opens up with you thinking pensively about what you’re going to do. You’re probably staring out a window looking at something. I’m wondering, actually, if you can take us back to where the case opens up, where you’re mulling through what your options are. You’ve got a lot of options right now and you’re thinking about what the best thing is. What was going on, what was your mindset at that time? TIM FERRISS: Yeah, I was actually literally looking out, in Austin where I recorded my podcast. I would say fundamentally it was, number one, has this become a crowded red ocean where other people can do this, what I started off doing in 2014. If there are one or more people who can do what I can do, I’m like, “Well, this seems redundant.” I would prefer to do something that is more of a category of one, to borrow from the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing. There wasn’t a financial pressure to stop. Certainly, there was a little bit of pressure to continue because it funds the foundation, it funds the angel investing, it pays for the bills and employees and so on. But it was more a question of, is this the game I want to play? We’re all playing games past a certain point, past the lowest rungs on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Then, beyond that, it’s being aware of what game you’ve currently opted into, what are the rules, what are the wind conditions, the failure modes. Then, authoring something that hopefully stacks the deck in your favor. That’s a lot of what I was thinking about. The entire landscape had become too saturated. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, and so you described this in the case as blue oceans versus red oceans. Reza, if you can talk about, in the Founder Mindset framework, how does Tim’s approach to pattern recognition and assumption testing compare to other founders? REZA SATCHU: I think there’s a critically important point on Tim’s mindset, and how I think it resonates with the Founder Mindset, is people think of committing to an idea as jumping off a cliff into shark-infested waters, and that somehow being a founder is full of risk, full of uncertainty. You close your eyes and you just hope and pray for the best. Okay, I can’t tell you how flawed that is. I’m a serial founder. I will tell you I think about risk all the time. I calculate risk and I’m not paralyzed by it. The key is actually making decisions in the face of risk. What Tim does with what he calls these assumptions or these experiments, he effectively is trusting his judgment to do some things. Nothing terribly consequential, but enough to get data to figure out whether or not he should continue pursuing his curiosity. He gives himself permission to go down a pathway of his curiosity, whereas, most people never give themselves that permission because they just think, “How could I possibly have this idea when others have so many more resources?” I call it “small c commitments.” He calls it these “two-week experiments,” but it’s this idea that he’s willing to suspend disbelief that others haven’t thought of this idea, and that he’s willing to actually test his ideas and dip his toe in before he jumps in. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Tim, for you, a lot of this began back when you wrote The 4-Hour Work Week, was that 15 years ago, give or take? TIM FERRISS: Almost 20, 2007, back when I had hair. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, that book challenged a lot of assumptions at that time. I’m wondering what assumptions you were testing as you wrote that book, and how do you weigh the risks and opportunities of coming out with something that seems a little audacious? TIM FERRISS: The first part I would say is simply asking questions that address some of the assumptions underlying traditional, let’s just call it, or conventional career planning. The deferred life plan. What would you do if you could not do that? If you could not rely on that. Which by the way is more and more relevant with some of the technologies that are coming. But if you couldn’t rely on that, exactly, as a social contract, what would you do? Then, it just led into lots of my own experiments. That was largely autobiographical. Then, teasing out the principles that allowed me to automate, and at the time use virtual assistants, that would be replaced by a lot of AI right now. That’s the first part. It was testing assumptions, but not just in a theoretical capacity. It was saying, “All right, I tried this thing, it didn’t work. I did this, it did work. I did this, it kind of worked, and here’s how I got it to really work. Here’s how you might think about dipping your toe in the water.” One critical part of that book that I think sometimes gets missed is cultivating a bias towards action. There are these exercises at the end of almost every chapter called Comfort Challenges. It’s just doing things that are very uncomfortable socially. There’s really no risk involved. This is not from the book, but my friend Noah Kagan talks about the Coffee Challenge, where people have to go in, order a coffee, and then ask for 10% off without giving any explanation, and just like, deal with that. It’s amazing. You see these people are like multiple-time founders or HBS grads, they’re pacing. They’re like, “Oh, it’s easy.” They’re pacing around the coffee shop for 30 minutes trying to build up the courage to do it. It’s like, “Yeah, that stuff helps.” From realizing that most stumbles or non-issues to begin with. In terms of presenting something that was contrarian, I first of all pitched the book. It’s a long story as to how I even got to the book, because I never wanted to write a book, but it was turned down by something like 29 publishers, violently. Some of the rejection letters were worthy of framing. Then, Steve Ross and Heather Jackson, at Crown, which was an imprint of Random House at the time, my pitch had been polished after getting rejected 29 times, literally, this is not an exaggeration. They were like, “Sure, kid. We’ll pay you pennies on the dollar to try this.” Their downside risk was very low. I had, as a younger person, I was published when I was 29, but at that time it’s like, what are your advantages? You can take stock of your advantage. At that time, it’s time, it’s speed, experimentation. You don’t have some permanent record of strikes that follows you around everywhere. I think you can afford to experiment. For me, it was ultimately an exercise in writing a book, and the only time it started to click was when I basically wrote it as I would write an email to two very particular friends after two glasses of wine. I threw out two drafts of that book, and then it unfolded, and that bought me permission to do a lot of other things. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, it worked out in the end, didn’t it? TIM FERRISS: It did work out. It’s not the end yet, so we’ll see. BRIAN KENNY: Reza, I had a chance to sit in on your class today, which was really interesting, and thank you for letting me do that. You talked a lot about failure, particularly in the beginning part of the class. What’s the Founder’s Mindset where it comes to being able to get rejected 29 times and still go back and ask for another publishing deal? REZA SATCHU: Okay, so first of all, just on failure, I think human psychology, is you often overestimate your downside, and I think to Tim’s point, you also massively underestimate your ability to recover. People imagine failure as this terrible thing that, oh my God, if this happens, it will be awful. Certainly, sitting here with the HBS students, what you’re doing is looking left and right and wondering, “Oh, my God, these people are going to think I’m a failure.” When in reality they’re barely going to think about you at all, but people are really stressed about that. I think the broader component around failure is not only do you overestimate what failure is, but by not putting yourself in positions of failure, two things don’t happen. One is you don’t learn. You don’t learn what happens through that failure. But the second thing is, I don’t know if this is what happened here, but people actually, when they look at someone who has stayed committed 29 times, I have this phrase which is like, magic happens when you commit, which is it’s not just you learn what you’re capable of. Other people show up precisely because they see the commitment. What people often misprice is that piece of the right tail upside. I think failure is a wonderful thing. I think a life without failure is a terrible life. It’s just a life where you don’t learn what you’re capable of. I think there needs to be a fundamental reframing of failure. Tim, I’d love you to talk about your concept of these one-way doors, irreversible law, like how you price risk, what does risk actually mean to you? TIM FERRISS: Yeah, I can speak to that. I also want to add something I left out of the question around The 4-Hour Work Week. There we go. I’ll let you take it. Just because people are rejecting your idea does not mean it’s a good idea. Just to state the obvious. REZA SATCHU: That’s true. TIM FERRISS: I agree with Paul Graham, Co-Founder of Y Combinator, who wrote an essay roughly around, the more labels you apply to yourself, the dumber you are. If you pride yourself on being contrarian, you’re actually just conforming to an anti-consensus. You’re actually still suffering from a really heavy form of bias. In my case, the reason I persisted through those 29 rejections was that the material that was going to be in the book, I had workshopped with, I don’t know, a thousand students at Princeton doing guest lectures at the invitation of my former professor. I had refined it, refined it like a stand-up comedian working on his 60-minute set, and I knew it worked. REZA SATCHU: Right, so you had an informational advantage. TIM FERRISS: I asked for feedback forms after every class. I had all these annoying pointed questions that students didn’t want to fill out. I knew that for a particular demographic it worked, and that’s why I persisted. If I had not had that data, I don’t think I would’ve persisted. I wouldn’t have had any grounds for plowing head in that way. Then, in terms of risk, I think there’s a lot to be said. I’m echoing Scott Galloway here, but choosing where you’re going to live and operate actually is a really important, sometimes more so than what you’re going to do. Moving to Silicon Valley was incredibly liberating because people fail all the time and they’re never counted out. I’ve invested in so many founders who failed the first time and then, boom. REZA SATCHU: Back at it. TIM FERRISS: Right? StumbleUpon, I was an advisor, didn’t work out. That was a zero for me as an advisor. But then, Garrett Camp a few months later was like, “Hey, I have this idea.” Turned it into Uber. People are never counted out. Being in an environment where that is the case matters a lot. It doesn’t have to be Silicon Valley, although that’s the most obvious. Risk for me, put simply, would be the probability of an irreversible negative outcome. There are some cases where that’s part of the calculus, but typically, I thought about making a journal. I seriously contemplated doing this because everyone’s making a journal now, but I went to the bookstore, I was like, “There are too many journals, I’m not going to do it.” But the journal was going to be called “worries that mostly didn’t happen.” It’s just like you just write down what you’re worried about and then you look back three months later, and again, none of that actually mattered. The cost of “failure” is very low for most things. You can also get a signal, positive or negative, go or no-go, pretty quickly if you’re methodical about it. I try to view, reframe failure, as scientific feedback. You have a hypothesis, you test it, it didn’t pan out, still valuable. If you’re optimizing for learning and relationships that transcend any given project, experiment, company, job, et cetera, those things snowball over time. If you’re keen on doing short-term experiments but long-term greedy, it’s very hard to lose, in my opinion. From what I’ve seen, and this is based on Silicon Valley, so it’s maybe anomalous, but it’s really hard to fail over the long term. REZA SATCHU: The amazing thing about this failure point is if you just think about two different career trajectories, one is a more traditional career trajectory. Let’s pick on consultants because, why not? There’s no real risk of failure. You’re going to get 95 things out of a hundred right on that path. On the Founder path, you are getting most things wrong. You’re asking people for money, they’re saying no. You’re asking customers to transact with you, they’re saying no. You’re trying to hire people, they’re saying no. You’ve got no resources. You’re constantly surrounded by a life of failure. You’ve just got to decide which life sounds better. What you suddenly realize is, wow, well, a life without failure, it’s hard to imagine having the impact that you all want to have, or having the return that you all want to have. I really think this point around risk really ties into failure, which is first of all, you need to reframe risk as a really great thing. Without risk, there’s no return. Risk is a good thing. It is not what you immediately think of, which is, “Oh, I want to stay away from it.” You need risk. Okay? What that doesn’t mean is that you’re jumping off a cliff. What it means is you understand how to operate in terms of risk. You need to incorporate some of the frameworks that you’ve talked about in class today to measure and calibrate it. But Tim’s not writing these books if he’s not willing to encounter risk. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, the 4-Hour Body, still recovering from some injuries from that one, 2010. Just had a surgery on this elbow as a result of that book. REZA SATCHU: Everyone must have thought that was a crazy idea. TIM FERRISS: It was crazy. But to use the 4-Hour Body as an example, the 4-Hour Work Week bought me permission to experiment outside of that lane, and so I did the 4-Hour Body in totally different category. Because the upside of that was so high if it opened the door to me writing books on any subject. The downside was that book doesn’t do well, and I go back to milking this 4-Hour, whatever the hell work week. The downside risk was very, very limited. I would also say that I think my experience with great schools, my experience with analytical people in general, is that they’re very good at thinking about all the possible downsides of doing the new thing or doing the “risky thing”. But they don’t spend as much time thinking about the cost of inaction or the status quo or taking the safe route. If you telescope out six months, a year, three years, five years, what are the emotional costs, financial, maybe relational, et cetera. It turns out when you start to look at these two options with equal weight, that the potentially safer route is just as fraught with all sort of problems as the supposedly risky route. Then, it’s like, “All right, I might as well do the weird thing first.” BRIAN KENNY: Did you ever worry about your brand though, the Tim Ferriss brand? If I do something that’s too contrarian, I may lose some of my brand cachet. TIM FERRISS: I don’t think about brand really at all, which isn’t to fault anyone who does, but I think brand is one of those words that can be a siren song for lots of decisions that compromise. I don’t want to say necessarily integrity and values, although it can be that, but you can be captured by, in my case, like an audience who rewards you for your most outlandish comments. If you follow that incentive structure on something like YouTube, you can wear a mask for so long that you become that mask. I’ve seen that happen to people, and you can’t hit control Z on that very easily, so I don’t think about brand. I pay a lot of attention to truly following my curiosity. When I do say a six, I do these two week experiments, but they’re generally within the context of a six to 12-month project. When I’m in that six to 12-month project, I am all in. I am completely saturated in it. I just find that there are a lot of ways to approach this. There’s no one way for everybody, but most of the hiccups along the way are just little toe stubs. But you have to get used to taking the hits. In other words, it’s like, if you were to go to a boxing class and you’ve never done boxing before and you get hit in the liver with a punch, it’s not even a hard punch. It’s going to be really shocking and unpleasant. If you do it for six months, you’ll be like, “Okay, yeah, I’m going to get 50 of these today. It’s fine.” You get over it, but you have to train your immune response, your stress response to this stuff. The only way to do that is by getting out there and trying stuff. REZA SATCHU: Brian, this is what’s so valuable to Founders, is exactly this, which is what they’re getting is hit all the time, but they’re learning that they can recover much faster through those hits. TIM FERRISS: Yeah. Could I add one more thing? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, of course. TIM FERRISS: I’ll give you an example. I remember the first time that I got, sadly, this is just a tax in the US, my first frivolous lawsuit, I got sued by somebody who was completely, it’s laughably ridiculous. I was so stressed out, I couldn’t sleep, and my publisher was involved, all this craziness. It was filed by the law firm that sued Subway for having 11 and a half inch foot long subs. So I’m dealing with all this and it’s tearing me up inside. Then, I was having a conversation with this friend of mine who’s been on multiple public boards. He’s in private equity for a super long time, very, very good investor. He’s like, “What?” He’s like, “This is the first time you’ve been sued.” He’s like, “I should sue you.” He’s like, “Welcome to the club.” He’s like, “What are you so upset about?” I was like, “What are you talking about?” I tried to justify it, and he’s like, “Ah. It’s fine.” I was like, “Oh, okay.” You just realize that a lot of the things you might contemplate now that you think are very big, huge problems, you can fix. A lot of it is just par for the course. REZA SATCHU: What do you think of this right to recover or what do you think human psychology is around recovery? Do people underestimate or overestimate their ability to recover? TIM FERRISS: I think it depends a lot on who you’re talking to, right? It’s like, if we’re talking to a bunch of refugees who had made hard choices. Then, I would say they probably accurately estimate their adaptiveness. REZA SATCHU: Ability. Yeah. TIM FERRISS: Their ability to adapt. I would say people who have, and this was me for a long time, executed to plan in a system where the rules are known, it’s more or less complete information, like higher education. It’s like, “Okay, great, you’re on the dean’s list, you’re summa cum laude, or whatever.” That those people underestimate their resilience, but I don’t actually think they’re wrong, because to develop the resilience you have to build some scar tissue. The only way you do that is by getting on the field. This sounds all abstract. It’s like, “No, okay, you want to change the world and build a billion-dollar company doing X?” It’s like, “All right, go talk to 10, go pitch 10 customers next week and ask them for money. As a dry run to get prepayment that will fund X, Y, or Z.” But don’t hide, and then I’m quoting Seth Godin, “But don’t hide behind the big.” Get out there and it’s going to be messy. BRIAN KENNY: Reza, I want to talk, so much of the case centers around optionality and all the options that Tim had in front of him, we talked about that a little bit upfront. I’m wondering, once you’ve achieved a certain level of success, a lot of opportunities open up. As a Founder, how do you sort through that? How do you think about what’s worth pursuing, what you shouldn’t pursue? What’s the thought process there? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, so it’s interesting. In my life, as someone who’s founded a few businesses, in some ways, the most recent businesses are harder, surprisingly. One would say, “Well, it’s easier because you’ve got more resources, more expertise, you have less hunger, and you have much more options. It’s not as critical that it has to succeed.” I teach and I found a business at the same time. That’s crazy. Most people would say that is not an optimal way to found a business. Whereas, my first couple of businesses, there’s no way I’d be teaching and founding a business. I’d be fully focused on founding. I think this idea that it gets easier, it might get easier from an expertise perspective, but suddenly you’ve got what I call the curse of optionality, which is you’ve got a number, and Tim, you’re facing some of this right now, frankly, this paradox of choice, which is precisely because of the success you’ve had you’ve got a whole bunch of choices. He mentioned Seth Godin, who’s a wonderful writer, who we interviewed for the case, and he said to Denise and me that we need to lock Tim in a room or in a cabin, and he needs to pick an option. Of course, what he was saying was that the world will be a much better place if Tim commits to something. As opposed to maximizing all of his options. I do think this curse, and for the students, people listening, I think that many of you will fall into this trap of preserving options for far too long and not knowing what you’re capable of when you commit. I’ve not had money and I’ve had money. Not having money is somewhat liberating because you just know what you need to do. When you have options, and those options could be a Harvard Business School degree, you suddenly start thinking, “Well, maybe I can preserve those options for a very long time.” I’m curious, Tim, I would ask you this question, which is you’ve got a whole bunch of options ahead of you. Here’s what I know to be true, is if you committed to one, I’m sure it will be far more impactful than if you preserve all of them. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, that’s true. I agree with that, but I would also say a few things. Number one is that you can validate or invalidate something really quickly. We were talking about this a bit earlier, but I was chatting with a student who was talking about maybe the safer route to finance and then less safe perhaps in entertainment, film potentially. I was saying, I’m saying, “All right, you know what’s going to really get attention, is if you’re an HBS grad who offers to shadow a show runner or a producer in pre-production on a movie, and you’re like, “Nothing is beneath me. Cleaning toilets, getting your coffee, I don’t care.'” It’s like, “All I want to do is observe some deal making and see what goes into making a film.” It’s like, “You can figure out if that is actually your dream or not very, very quickly. You might be completely allergic to it, but you can figure that out after a week of being in the pre-production office.” That’s number one. REZA SATCHU: But are you also suggesting that because that’s a differentiator, meaning, there’s something that it says about you, that you’re willing to do that? TIM FERRISS: Here’s my experience. Even though you might feel there’s very little time and a big rush, there’s not a big rush. You can take time to have these little detours and try things. The second is that even though I’m doing some different things, let’s just say angel investing newsletter foundation focused on mental health therapeutics, nonprofit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. There’s actually a way in which they reinforce one another. I will use, say, the podcast to interview scientists based on science I’m interested in to determine if I think they’re a good candidate for the foundation, or potentially, it doesn’t have to be a scientist. If I find that their personality is compatible enough and their idea is compelling enough that I want to make an investment in their company. I can use that as a discovery mechanism then for sourcing. I would say, also it depends on how much… Preserving all of your options also is just an illusion. You can’t really do that. The nature of making a decision, it’s like incision, decision to cut away. You are by definition cutting off a lot of paths, which I do for six to 12 months at a time. But you can have a few things, in my case, running at the same time in parallel. I would say optionality might not be all you think it is. If I look at hundreds of people I’ve interviewed on the podcast who are by any measure top performers in their fields, one of the most common comments or concepts that comes up is the power of positive constraints. Positive constraints, commit. It doesn’t have to be commit forever. It shouldn’t probably be commit forever, unless you’re the person who knows at age five that you want to do X. If you’re that, I don’t know, maybe you wouldn’t be here. REZA SATCHU: Positive constraints means cutting off options, in some sense? TIM FERRISS: It means cutting off options, or it could be anything. If you’re writing, it could be a space or page constraint. It could be, I have to write this all in third person or first person. REZA SATCHU: Well, it’s also your comment around, if I’ve got a problem, I will only solve it by taking something away. TIM FERRISS: Right, so in the case of the podcast, I found myself starting to drag my feet because it’s a very saturated marketplace. One of my key advantages that I had early on, besides just starting pretty early in 2014, was my research and the ability that I had to dig and find things that were interesting. Now, you can go in ChatGPT and say, “Give me 10 questions in the style of Tim Ferriss or Lex Friedman or Joe Rogan interviewing this person.” Boom, you’ll get good answers. That advantage has effectively disappeared, and there are a lot of ways to potentially respond to that. But for me, number one, I’m generally not looking for the cutting edge. I’m looking for dull edge. I want to see some proof of concept before I do angel investing or before I do some hare-brained thing, like make a card game, which some of you may have or not. That’s sitting up at the top for anybody who wants a copy. I think that fundamentally a lot of it comes down to asking yourself, how do you maximize for… I know this is, again, it’s so simple, but if you maximize for learning and relationships that transcend whatever that single project or job is, this is particularly effective if you are in a place like San Francisco. I don’t want to sell San Francisco. It’s pretty dirty and filthy. But I think if you were going to choose projects and you decided as a thought exercise to rank order the parameters as who, like who am I directly observing and working with? Then, where, and then what/sector, that actually comes last, I think you could end up with some pretty interesting options on the menu. BRIAN KENNY: We haven’t talked about impact, but I know that’s an important part of the thing that you cover in Founder’s Mindset. Can you talk a little bit about the idea of thinking about impact at the outset and not at the end of the journey? REZA SATCHU: I think so many people fall into this trap. I think I fell into this trap early in my career, which is my life is going to be in these stages. The impact stage will be that last piece of my life when I’ve learned a lot, when I’ve had the benefit of resources, all these sorts of things. The problem is there’s two problems. One is you may or may not be around for that last piece. BRIAN KENNY: Never know. REZA SATCHU: But the second point is it turns out that actually having impact along the way, and I love the way you describe it, which is start with the small things. Start with the people in your life that you’re… We all have these, especially here, have these visions of grandeur around having massive impact. Well, I’d say the most important way to do that is to actually start living a life of impact right away and on the small things. I think that, Tim, when you talk about, so what I view learning, what I view learning as, because a lot of people talk about you want to maximize learning, which I completely agree, and I’d be curious how you define learning. Okay, so I’m going to propose what my definition of learning is, and you tell me whether this, because I think it’s an important concept because learning is… If you had to say, what is the thing that is going to most correlate with impact, it would be learning. He who learns, he or she who learns the most is going to attract the most credibility, resources such that they can have the impact that they most desperately want. I define learning in the age of AI as the spot where you’re making… it’s all about decision making. Meaning, the trait we are most trying to learn is judgment. Judgment occurs when you’re making consequential decisions that you’re accountable for. You must live a life where you’re pushing yourself to make decisions, some of which will be wrong, some of which will be right, in order to build the thing we most want, which is judgment. Okay, so I’m curious to know your thoughts about that. TIM FERRISS: Learning, there’s how to learn, and then there’s what to learn. If you’re looking at say, who to work with, and then the where, and then the what, right? There are certain skills that are not going to transfer. It’s like, okay, if you’re in the waste management business and you’re understanding the ins and outs of waste management, I’m just making that up because I like unsexy stuff, that may not transfer to your hot shot AI startup for whatever, customer service. But if you are observing, this is an old school example, like a Wayne Huizenga. REZA SATCHU: Yeah, Wayne Huizenga. They don’t know who Wayne Huizenga is. TIM FERRISS: I know. REZA SATCHU: You and I know who Wayne Huizenga is. TIM FERRISS: I know, waste management, then Blockbuster, which went extinct back in the Pleistocene era, but that guy was a master deal maker. If you’re able to watch someone acquiring dozens and dozens of companies, and how that entire dance is woven, that transfers. If you’re learning how to communicate, let’s just say, I’m making this up, you work for Cards Against Humanity. This is a very popular game as some of you may know, they were really, really good at PR stunts. If you work at that company when it is small and you’re involved with all of those PR stunts, which fundamentally are thinking about positioning and differentiation, that will apply to everything. It’s just asking yourself, where could this transfer? Where could this apply? Then, that’s the stuff that you focus on. For me, it’s in a sense meta skills, that if you were to copy and paste, you take somebody, look, it doesn’t matter. Well, I’ll give you actually maybe a more contemporary example, like Jeff Bezos. All right. What is Jeff Bezos’ superpower? I would say that it is having longer time horizons than almost everybody else, and defending and justifying and reiterating that in every shareholder letter. He trained Wall Street like a domesticated puppy, like a puppy. REZA SATCHU: From day one, yeah. TIM FERRISS: Talk about just incredible persuasion and the pro sleight of hand and also just business mastery. But the point is, if you have a longer time horizon than other people, that’s a huge competitive advantage also in and of itself. If you can be around someone who exemplifies that, because I can say that, and you’re like, “Okay, I got it.” But it’s like, do you really? You need to see how that is emphasized over and over again. Or, like a Herb Kelleher at Southwest. Would I have loved to have worked for that guy? Would I have quit my tech job to work for him? Absolutely, because such a maniacal focus on being the low cost airline. I remember he was interviewed at one point and he said to the journalists, because they were saying how hard it was, what he did, and he’s like, “No, you can do my job.” Then, he’s like, “All right, give me a situation.” They gave him a situation. He’s like, “All right, does that help us to be the low cost airline or not?” They’re like, “No.” He’s like, “Yeah, that’s a no.” He’s like, “Okay, next one.” He’s like, “Yeah.” If you have the focus, but you need to be around people who are doing that and living it so you can see it in different contexts. This is going to sound bizarre because I’m thinking about adopting another dog. But there’s an expression in dog training, which is basically if the dog hasn’t done it, say a behavior, shaping a behavior in 20 different locations, 20 different durations, they don’t have that behavior. It’s not durable. Humans are the same. It’s conditioning. Having the opportunity to work with someone where you see certain characteristics exemplified; certain behaviors, certain principles enacted that can be applied to different businesses, man, I think that’s an incredible shortcut. But you and I have different perspectives on this. I think working for a startup’s a fantastic way to learn on someone else’s dime with the understanding that- BRIAN KENNY: That’s our youngest audience member, by the way. TIM FERRISS: Yeah. Start them young. Start them young. REZA SATCHU: It’s true. What I’d say, I think just, look, I think the question is, in the age of AI, what are the traits that we can teach people? I think that the challenge is that things like memorization and observation are far less valuable. What is valuable is this elusive thing called judgment. The real question is, how do we get it? I think, yeah, you can get it by watching someone else, but how you really get it is by doing it yourself. Actually being in the arena, making those decisions. One of the things you said, Tim, which is very interesting to me, because I have a similar phrase, when you said you have a bias for action. I have a phrase which is, if in doubt, act, which immediately people say, “Well, wait, Reza, you don’t know what you’re doing, you’re going to act?” No, the reason I say that is because so many people are paralyzed by imperfect or uncertain information, and so they’re like deer in headlights. What I suggest is, even if you’re going to stay the course, train yourself to make a decision that you’re actually staying the course, which is a bias for action. I’m curious how you think about, bias for action is, it feels risky. I’m curious how you view that. TIM FERRISS: What I would say is I have a tendency… My mom literally got me a shirt that says, ”Wait a second, let me overthink this.” My tendency is to, I don’t want to say perseverate, but over consider the ramifications of a lot of decisions. It’s been a practice of conditioning myself to be like, all right, what if I tried what Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and so on has done, where he wants to enable his chief of staff to act quickly enough that they roughly get things wrong 10% of the time. That’s literally a guideline that he uses with his chief of staff. He says 10% footfall, which is a little confusing because it’s a tennis reference. Anyway, but I think applying that to your own life where you’re like, all right, what can I put on automatic, just no decision autopilot default, number one, where can I just completely remove decisions? Sometimes that’s with diet, exercise. You don’t want to get up in the morning and decide which of 20 toothpaste tubes you’re going to use. You have your toothpaste and you just deal with your toothpaste. Similarly, you could extrapolate that and apply it to giving employees autonomous decision-making power and creating a culture where you actually reward screw-ups. I literally met with, I was having a blood draw this morning because I’m in Boston for proteomics assay. Anyway, it’s a long story. But they have a dedicated discord within the company for celebrating bleep-ups basically. That are not egregious. It’s also like, all right, how do we not do this again? But people get rewarded for ambition, mistakes of ambition, not mistakes of sloth, which is straight from Machiavelli, so I’m not sure how I feel about that. But in any case, I don’t know about also… I got stuck on the AI stuff again, because I don’t know, I wish I could give everybody and myself a strategy for making yourself AI proof. I don’t know what that looks like. I think though you can make a decision about, am I going to use these tools or am I going to stick my head in the sand and try to find a way around them? I think probably the way to go for it is spend your evenings for two weeks vibe coding and messing around with AI, so that you have some idea of how you might utilize it. Because within two or three years, we’re going to have multi-billion dollar companies or billion-dollar companies with one to three employees, I’m very confident in that. They’ll just use agents to fill a lot of roles, like CFO and so on. People are already doing this. I wouldn’t get too hung up on that. Although I would say, if I were to play the counterpoint, that the soft skills that I was mentioning earlier, negotiating, deal-making, this is a very intrinsically human interaction. REZA SATCHU: Human thing. TIM FERRISS: It’s very rare that you’re just going to be able to send pitch emails with the deal structure and you’re like, “Yes or no, thumbs up?” With this emoticon based on my AI chatbot, like, “Great. Let’s do a deal.” Typically, not how it works, especially as the stakes get bigger, which don’t mean they’re huge, that they’re just consequential for whoever you’re dealing with. That stuff I don’t see going away anytime soon. BRIAN KENNY: I want to give time. We’re coming close to the end of our time. I’ve got one more question for each of you, but before we do that, Tim, maybe you want to tell people about your latest venture? Because I think there are some takeaways, some giveaway items. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, if people want, so this is a very off menu thing. BRIAN KENNY: It’s just like the Oprah Show. You’re going to get something to take with you. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, exactly. It’s not a car, but it’s something else. I ended up collaborating with this guy, Elan Lee, who’s one of the world’s best game designers for the last two years to create a card game for off-screen social interaction. That’s my current project, is a card game of all things. I could explain why I chose that, but the biggest one was the who. This Elan Lee, where I was like, “I would pay to just hang out with this guy.” He’s such a soulful, deep thinker, who’s ethical and also happens to be a polymath, top 1% in multiple fields. I was like, “I just want to steep myself in whatever magic juju this guy has.” That’s how fundamentally I made the decision. Yeah, there are games up there, it’s called COYOTE. Then, beyond that, I do have an 800-page draft of a book. That’s not an overstatement. I’ll be whittling that down over the next six months probably. That’s been like eight years in the making. It’s been sitting back there for a long time. There’s other stuff going on. BRIAN KENNY: That’s awesome. Now, this has been a great conversation. I knew it would be. I was so excited to do this today. Before I let you go, I’ll ask the same question of each of you, and I’ll start with you, Tim, and I always give the professor the last word because it’s Harvard Business School, but it’s a pretty simple question. TIM FERRISS: Reza is pretty good at getting the last word anyway. BRIAN KENNY: I think that’s true. REZA SATCHU: That’s true. That is definitely BRIAN KENNY: If you just think about the case, you’ve lived it, what lessons do you think emerging founders should take from the case about navigating similar inflection points in their own journey? TIM FERRISS: Let’s see. I’m going to give credit to a mentor of mine named Ed Zschau. He was a professor of mine at Princeton, taught really the first entrepreneurship class that I’m aware of, “High-tech Entrepreneurship,” ELE 491. Still have all my notes from the class. He used to teach at HBS and then jump-started this entrepreneurship program at Princeton. He was congressman from Silicon Valley, former competitive figure skater, took a couple of companies public. Was one of the first, if not the first computer science teacher at Stanford, even though he had no computer science background. It was like somebody else dropped out and they’re like, “Can anybody else teach this class? He was like, “Oh, I’ll figure it out.” Back in the day. In his last class, I think I’m getting the name of this song right, but he actually gets up and he sings this song. I’m going to do it my way. The whole point is everybody’s making up everything by and large. There is no one right way to do it. I think that what I would hope people to take from my very bizarre case study, and I say that, I couldn’t have been prouder and happier with how everybody put it together, Denise and Reza and so on, is that you don’t have to follow the prescription, whatever the prescription is. You don’t have to meet the expectations, whatever the expectations are. You just don’t have to do it. There are a lot of ways to improvise and zig and zag. As long as you’re not too calcified around what you consider your identity. You just have to be really careful with painting yourself into a corner with that. That’s what I would hope people to take from it, is just there is a lot of room to improvise and maneuver. People ask me a lot, for instance, I’ve done these 800 plus interviews on the podcast, and they’re like, “What are the commonalities?” I’m like, “The greatest commonality is there are no commonalities.” It’s like for every incredible writer who gives me one set of advice, I sit in front of the screen, even if it’s blank for 10 hours a day, chained myself to the desk. To, B.J. Novak of The Office and movies and all sorts of stuff, he was like, “Yeah, I really need to get into the mood.” It’s like, “I’ll have my cappuccino, I’ll read the paper, I’ll do this thing. I really need to be in the right state to write.” They’re both doing amazing jobs, and they have diametrically opposing advice, which means you can figure out what rules and what stories work for you. I would just say mess around. You have your whole life to be safe and conservative and not politically. You get the idea. Like color within the lines. I guess you could have the rest of your life to be conservative too politically. But the point is, there will never, in my opinion, be a better time for you guys coming out of HBS to just embrace your weird self and try some of the stuff that is going to get harder to do later. REZA SATCHU: Look, I think that’s extremely well said. Tim, when we wrote this case study, in some ways it’s probably the longest case study because he’s got so many things going on. My students are probably like, “This is a 20-plus page story.” It’s everything from dancing, to an author, to podcasts, to all sorts of things. If I had to summarize it, I’d want two takeaways. One is, live a life full of curiosity and allow yourself to explore the things that you’re curious with. Whether that’s these experiments, small C commitments, just suspend disbelief and trust your judgment to actually explore things that you’re curious in. The upside is far greater than the downside. That’s the first point. The second point is, I really think Tim’s risk framework is very interesting. In some ways you hear a story and you immediately think, “Well, this guy is embracing risk at every turn.” It’s actually the opposite. He understands that he has to live a life with risk, but he’s actually thinking really hard about how to calibrate it. The way he does that is by actually understanding that his downside is nowhere near as bad as we all think it is. It’s defining his fears, which allows him to hopefully do something extraordinary because he’s shifting what the outcome could be. I think that is really, I would say those are, trust your curiosity and embrace risk, but calibrate it appropriately and understand that, especially coming out of a school like Harvard, your downside is nowhere near as bad as you think it is. TIM FERRISS: I’d love to add just a few things real quick. The risk mitigation stuff and thinking about that, if people are interested, I wrote these a long time ago, but it’s a two-part blog post series called How, I think it’s just “How I Created a Real World MBA.” Related to how I tiptoed my way into angel investing. REZA SATCHU: Well, this is your angel investing. TIM FERRISS: I think that’s worth, I think people in this room might find that an interesting read. The second is really study the outliers. Because if anyone has done it, there is the possibility that you could also do it or chart your own path. A book that you might not expect, it’s one called The Art of Possibility, I think the author’s last name, it’s by a husband and wife duo, Zander, Z-A-N-D-E-R. It’s very fast read, amazing book. There are a lot of book recommendations I could give, but that’s a fast one that I would encourage people to check out. Really study the outliers, like Yvon Chouinard, the early chapters, the early chapters, or if you think of someone who’s a risk-taker, like Richard Branson, read Losing My Virginity. It’s like at every turn that guy is hedging risk and minimizing and mitigating risk. It’s remarkable how good he is at capping downside. I would just say, study the outliers. There are a lot of ways to tiptoe into things to figure out a signal very, very quickly at low cost. BRIAN KENNY: I think that’s a good note to end on.

Title: Broadcom Stock Retreats After Soaring on OpenAI Deal—Monitor These Key Price Levels

Broadcom (AVGO) shares dropped Tuesday morning, giving back a portion of the big gains posted yesterday following news that the chip giant had forged a deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The company said it would collaborate with OpenAI on the development of artificial intelligence accelerator and network systems for delivery from 2026 to 2029. The announcement comes just a week after rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) inked a deal with the San Francisco-based AI start-up. Broadcom shares were down nearly 4% at around $343 in recent trading, tracking a broader move lower for U.S. equities, after surging 10% on Monday. Investors have bid up the stock, which has risen about 50% since the start of the year, amid surging demand for custom AI chips as enterprises build out their AI capacity. Below, we take a closer look at Broadcom’s chart and use technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching out for. After hitting their all-time high last month, Broadcom shares retraced toward the 50-day moving average (MA) before attracting buying interest near the respected indicator. Buying in the stock accelerated yesterday on the highest trading volume in over a month, a move that also coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) reclaiming the 50 threshold to signal a return of bullish price momentum. Let’s point out two key overhead areas to watch on Broadcom’s chart and also identify important support levels worth monitoring during profit-taking episodes. Buying from current levels could initially see a move up to around $374. Tactical traders who have bought the recent pullback may look to lock in profits in this location near the stock’s record high, especially if the RSI simultaneously moves into overbought territory. If the shares enter price discovery mode, investors can forecast a possible overhead target to watch by using bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes prior price action to project future directional movements. When applying the analysis to Broadcom’s chart, we take the uptrend from late August to early September and reposition it from last month’s low. This forecasts a bullish target of around $415, implying 16% upside from Monday’s closing price. We selected this prior move as it followed an earlier dip to the 50-day-MA in August, providing clues as to how a new trend higher from the indicator may take shape if price action rhymes. The first support level worth monitoring sits around $324. This area on the chart could attract buying interest near the September and October lows, which currently closely align with the rising 50-day MA. Finally, selling below this important level could spark a more significant drop to the $291 level. Investors could look to accumulate Broadcom shares in this region near a trendline that connects a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart between July and September.

Title: Stock market ‘concentration risk’ now higher than dot-com bubble period, IMF warns
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/10/14/stock-market-concentration-risk-now-higher-than-dot-com-bubble-period-imf-warns/

Full Content:
Market valuations have “become stretched”, increasing the probably of a “disorderly correction”, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned. In its latest Global Financial Stability update, published alongside its half-year report on the global economy, the Washington-based fund highlights the concentration risk within the US’s S&P 500 index from the so-called magnificent seven stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia). It noted that the information technology sector accounted for a weight of 35 per cent of the total S&P 500, similar to during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, but this time just seven stocks accounted for 33 per cent of the index. That meant the concentration risk “was now substantially higher than during the dot-com bubble”. Many analysts believe stock markets, particularly in the US, are on the brink of major negative correction following an investment glut in artificial intelligence (AI). AI-related companies have accounted for around 80 per cent of US stock market gains this year. [ Negative impact of tariffs starting to show, IMF warnsOpens in new window ] In its report, the IMF said the rebound in global equity prices since US president Donald Trump’s April tariff announcement had outpaced expected future earnings. Despite recent economic data trending negative, markets appear to be downplaying the potential effects of US tariffs on growth and inflation, it said. Global financial markets “have largely brushed off subsequent shocks and uncertainties,” it said, noting financial conditions across most regions have eased back to “accommodative levels”. But it warned “the apparent calm masks a degree of complacency.” “Despite trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainties, and rising concerns about sovereign indebtedness, asset prices have returned to stretched valuations and financial conditions have broadly eased,” it said. “Against substantial AI-related investments, the possibility of mega-cap stocks failing to generate expected returns to justify current lofty equity valuations could trigger deterioration in investor sentiment and make the stocks susceptible to sudden, sharp correction,” the IMF said. An analysis of sovereign bond markets also highlighted “growing pressure from widening fiscal deficits on the functioning of markets,” it said. [ Why is the US economy so much stronger than Europe’s?Opens in new window ] In advanced economies, sovereign bond markets are increasingly dependent on price-sensitive investors, it said. “Stress in core bond markets, although a tail risk, could have broad and disruptive ramifications for financial markets, given bonds’ role as key benchmarks and collateral,” it said. In its report, the IMF also highlighted the weakness of the US dollar “Overall, the dollar has depreciated by about 10 per cent so far this year against major currencies,” it said. “Analysts have put forth a number of possible drivers for dollar weakness, from a revaluation of dollar strength amid concerns over the US fiscal position to a shift in allocation away from US-dollar-denominated assets driven by concerns about US policy uncertainty,” it said.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. On Monday, October 13, stocks moved decisively higher, as seen in the S&P 500 rising 1.56%, the Dow 30 rising 1.29%, and the Nasdaq 100 rising 2.18%. Most stocks saw buying, though some stocks missed out. The following table shows the list of 10 stocks that generated the highest returns on the last trading day: On the other hand, the following table shows the list of 10 stocks that generated the lowest returns: Why does this matter? Significant stock moves - up or down - deserve your attention. Sharp declines in fundamentally strong names can offer smart buying opportunities. And when momentum aligns with solid fundamentals, riding the trend can be highly rewarding. In above, we find Humana (HUM) Attractive while Broadcom (AVGO) looks Attractive but Volatile. Single stock can be risky, but there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach we take with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We go beyond just equities. Is a portfolio of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto in addition to equities and bonds - likely to return more during the next 1-3 years, and protect you better if markets crash 20%? We have crunched the numbers. Analysing over the last one week (5 trading days), weakness was evident in the S&P 500 falling 1.27%, the Dow 30 falling 1.34%, and the Nasdaq 100 falling 0.91%. The pullback was broad, but select names remained resilient. The following table shows the list of 10 stocks that generated the highest returns over the last week: Similarly, the following table shows the 10 stocks that were at the bottom in terms of returns: On a slightly wider timeline over the last one month, stocks moved decisively higher, as seen in the S&P 500 rising 1.07%, the Dow 30 rising 0.51%, and the Nasdaq 100 rising 2.73%. Most stocks saw buying, though some stocks missed out. The following table shows the 10 stocks that generated the maximum returns over the last one month: In the same period, these 10 stocks were at the bottom in terms of returns: Picking winners on a consistent basis is not an easy task - especially given the volatility associated with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Sell RKLB Stock At $65?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab’s (NASDAQ: RKLB) stock has garnered considerable investor interest in 2025, climbing over 150% year-to-date. Trading at about $65, this extraordinary surge reflects an increasing optimism surrounding the company’s Neutron rocket program and its growing involvement in the commercial space sector. Nevertheless, under this excitement lies a valuation dilemma: the company is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 66.5x—more than twenty times the S&P 500’s 3.2x multiple. For investors contemplating entry at these levels, the pivotal question is whether this momentum is supported by fundamentals or primarily fueled by speculation regarding future prospects. Based on traditional valuation metrics, this premium seems challenging to rationalize. We’ll explore the company’s financials in the sections that follow. That said, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like RKLB, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns greater than 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; they avoided the drastic fluctuations, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – How BBAI Stock Rises To $20? The company’s financial profile exposes stark inconsistencies: Despite its unprofitability, Rocket Lab possesses a strong balance sheet that allows them to pursue growth investments: The stock has shown moderate resilience amid market volatility. While it dropped 82.8% during the 2022 inflation crisis (more severe than the S&P 500’s 25.4% decline), it rebounded to pre-crisis levels by November 2024 and has since continued to rise. See more – Buy or Sell RKLB Stock? Our evaluation focuses on past performance and current fundamentals, which suggest RKLB is overvalued. Nonetheless, we may be mistaken in this evaluation, and investors might be inclined to accept a higher valuation multiple for the stock’s future potential, especially concerning the Neutron rocket program. The Neutron rocket signifies a strategic advancement into the medium-lift launch market, potentially positioning the company to compete more effectively with SpaceX’s Falcon 9. If this program succeeds, it could significantly enlarge Rocket Lab’s addressable market and alter its financial dynamics. The company’s solid balance sheet offers the financial endurance to realize this vision without immediate pressure for profitability. That being said, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has offered a responsive way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as explained in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Rocket Lab is deemed expensive when assessed against present operations—a company losing nearly 46 cents for every dollar of revenue while being valued at 66.5x sales. For investors concentrated on traditional value metrics, this introduces considerable downside risk. Nonetheless, for those who have faith in the company’s technological prowess and the transformative potential of its Neutron program, the existing valuation may signify fair compensation for engaging in the commercial space industry's growth trajectory. Ultimately, the investment decision rests on whether one is acquiring historical performance or prospective opportunities.

Title: How JOBY Stock Falls To $3?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/14/how-joby-stock-falls-to-3/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T13:33:45Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Joby Aviation stock (NYSE: JOBY) has captivated Wall Street with its vision of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft transforming urban transportation. The stock has experienced a remarkable rise, increasing by over 200% from under $6 a year ago to approximately $17 now. What’s driving the excitement? It’s a blend of future mobility enthusiasm and momentum. Firstly, there’s the overarching narrative of electric vehicles and sustainable transportation that has taken the markets by storm. Secondly, the concept of the “flying taxi” has investors envisioning a sci-fi future coming true. Thirdly, Joby has been making strategic advancements – forming partnerships with major entities like Delta Air Lines and Toyota, reaching certification milestones, and generating news that maintains the excitement. The firm has positioned itself as a leader in the burgeoning eVTOL market, announcing progress on FAA certification and expanding its manufacturing capabilities. However, here’s the sobering reality – while electric air taxis appear to be the future, that future is still years away from significant commercial operations and generating revenue. Joby continues to be a pre-revenue entity, depleting cash reserves as it strives for certification and commercialization. Naturally, it’s incurring losses – aerospace development is one of the most capital-intensive industries. For context, the company's operating cash flows were -448 million, with an operating loss of $638 million in the previous twelve-month period. That said, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like JOBY, you might consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has yielded returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What’s the reason for this? As a collective group, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – How BBAI Stock Rises To $20? We agree that next-generation mobility stocks are focused on future growth, and the potential market for urban air mobility is vast. See our perspective on – Why Archer Aviation Is Positioned To Become The Uber of Air Travel. However, have you ever considered the downside risks? Think about it logically. There are numerous risks that could undermine Joby’s stock growth, and when things go awry, such speculative stocks don’t just dip – they plunge. This isn’t merely a theory. Let’s examine what occurred with JOBY during the inflation shock of 2022 when the Fed raised interest rates aggressively. The stock plummeted a staggering 79.7% from its peak of $15.70 in February 2021 to $3.18 by December 2022, while the S&P 500 fell only 25.4% from peak to trough. Consider that for a moment – JOBY dropped more than three times worse than the overall market. This highlights the distinction between speculative pre-revenue stocks and genuine businesses with real cash flows and profits. Yes, the stock regained its pre-crisis peak by July 2025 and even climbed to $20.39 in August, but that recovery took place during one of the most favorable environments for risk assets. What will occur when the cycle flips again? So what’s the actual downside risk for JOBY stock from its current price of $16.80? If history serves as a guide, it’s a possible decrease of approximately 80% or more, bringing the stock back to the $3-4 range. Are you ready for it? This isn’t fearmongering about JOBY – it's what transpired in 2022. The stock plummeted 80% from its peak to trough. And the fundamental risk profile hasn’t changed significantly. The company is still pre-revenue, still experiencing cash burn, now facing substantial dilution from the $500 million equity raise, still years away from significant commercialization, and primarily trading based on hope and future potential instead of current business fundamentals. The next time markets experience a risk-off scenario – be it due to inflation, recession, geopolitical crises, or any other shock – high-flying pre-revenue stocks often lead the decline. An 80% drop from current levels would bring JOBY to around $3.36, uncannily close to where it hit bottom in December 2022. If this level of risk makes you anxious, you might want to consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided an effective way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while limiting losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. The intent of this analysis is to inform investors of the actual downside risk associated with JOBY stock. It may or may not occur. However, the risk is undoubtedly substantial. The firm remains pre-revenue in one of the most capital-intensive and heavily regulated industries in the world. The recent $500 million equity raise – while prolonging the cash runway – significantly dilutes existing shareholders and emphasizes that commercialization and profitability are still aspirations. Understand that you are not investing in a profitable business; you are betting on eVTOL technology receiving certification, gaining public acceptance, achieving profitable operational scale, and Joby emerging victorious in a market characterized by fierce competition from well-capitalized rivals. Ultimately, it boils down to whether you can tolerate what the downside volatility might resemble if matters don’t unfold as anticipated with Joby. An 80% drawdown isn’t hypothetical – it has already occurred once. The question isn’t whether JOBY can decline that much again. The inquiry is: when the next market shock hits, are you ready to see your investment possibly drop by 80% or more?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From quantitative point of view, The 68.7% change in Netflix (NFLX) stock from 10/13/2024 to 10/13/2025 was primarily driven by a 25.8% change in the company’s Net Income Margin (%). There is more to this story than just numbers, but first, let's break down the stock price movement into its contributing factors. That is one way to look at stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio evaluates much more, and is designed to reduce stock-specific risk while giving upside exposure. Coming back to the "change": The change in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue and margins, has an underlying business and investor sentiment story behind it. Below, we have identified key developments that influenced stock price movement for NFLX stock. Before that, as a quick background: NFLX provides TV series, documentaries, films, and mobile games in multiple genres and languages to over 222 million paid members across 190 countries. Opinion: We currently find NFLX stock relatively expensive. Why so? Have a look at the full story. Read Buy or Sell NFLX Stock to see what drives our current opinion. Risk: That said, Netflix isn’t immune to big sell-offs. It plunged about 56% in the Global Financial Crisis and took a 44% hit in the 2018 correction. During the Covid pandemic, the drop was smaller but still notable at 23%. The worst was the inflation shock, where it fell close to 76%. So even with solid growth and a strong brand, NFLX can get hit hard when the market shakes. Quality cushions the fall but doesn’t fully prevent steep losses. Picking winners on a consistent basis is not an easy task - especially given the volatility associated with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Markets Set For Lower Open As China Conflict Continues

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stocks rebounded Monday but poised to open lower Tuesday as the trade conflict with China continues. Futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 have dipped 1%, Nasdaq 100 futures are 1.2% lower and Dow Jones futures are down 0.6%. The back-and-forth of stock prices tracks with the ongoing trade conflict between the U.S. and China. President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs after China restricted the export of rare earth minerals last week. Trump then walked back his aggressive tone, assuring the public in a Truth Social post that the trade disagreement was resolvable. Tuesday, China sanctioned five U.S. subsidiaries of a South Korean shipmaker. After trade tensions flared last week, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiked to $21.99 from $17.09. The index retreated to a still-elevated level of $19.03 before eclipsing $21 again. The VIX Index quantifies market expectations for near-term volatility, based on S&P 500 option prices. On the inflation front, a new analysis by Goldman Sachs concludes that U.S. tariffs will raise prices by year-end. According to a research note summarized by the LA Times, analysts said U.S. consumers will probably absorb 55% of tariff costs while American companies pay 22%. Only 18% of tariff costs were projected to hit foreign exporters. If the projections prove accurate, the Federal Reserve’s job of stimulating jobs while managing inflation could get complicated. Earnings season begins Tuesday with scheduled reports from JPMorgan Chase, Johnson & Johnson, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Blackrock, and others. Third quarter reports will demonstrate how corporate profits are trending amid the unique circumstances in 2025. Themes to watch include: What is a good P/S ratio? The price-to-sales or P/S ratio is a metric investors use to evaluate a company’s stock price. It is particularly useful for companies that aren’t profitable because you can calculate it without positive earnings. Like the P/E ratio, the P/S requires context to interpret. A low P/S ratio could mean the company is undervalued or that investors are not confident in the company’s future. A high P/S indicates investors are willing to pay more for the company’s sales—which is good when the company lives into the optimism, and bad when it does not. You can calculate the P/S ratio as the company’s market capitalization divided by its revenue over the last 12 months. Alternatively, you can calculate a forward P/S ratio as the company’s market capitalization divided by its expected revenue over the next 12 months. The two calculations quantify what investors are willing to pay for $1 of the company’s previous or expected sales. The P/S ratio is most valuable in comparisons. You can compare a P/S ratio to: Lower P/S ratios are generally associated with lower growth expectations, while higher P/S ratios imply more optimistic growth expectations. And this makes sense: The standard P/S calculation uses a sales figure that’s already happened, but investors make trading decisions on their future predictions. If investors expect next year’s sales to be, say, 50% higher, they’ll accept a higher stock price. Mathematically, a higher stock price increases the market capitalization which raises the P/S ratio. This is why fast-growing industries, like technology, have higher P/S ratios than more predictable industries such as utilities. Value investors prefer P/S ratios below 1 or no higher than 2, assuming the company has a fundamentally productive business model and healthy balance sheet. Growth investors tolerate or even gravitate towards higher P/S ratios because they can signal outperformance relative to peers. These P/S ratios as of Oct. 10, 2025, demonstrate how this metric can vary dramatically by business and industry. The average P/S ratio of the S&P 500 is 3.17.

Stock futures and bitcoin are sliding this morning, while gold continues hitting new highs, as investors keep an eye on developments related to trade tensions with China and await a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell; quarterly results from major U.S. banks are coming in better than analysts had anticipated; GM shares are down after the automaker revealed a $1.6 billion charge over weakness in its EV business; and shares of rare earth miners continue surging following China’s announcement of trade restrictions on the high-tech materials. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a lower open after major indexes rebounded Monday from a steep downturn to close out last week, as concerns linger about trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies. Investors this morning are digesting earnings reports from major banks and are awaiting remarks from Fed Chair Powell, who is due to speak this afternoon on the outlook for the economy and interest rates. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.7% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq dropped 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively. Bitcoin was also down sharply after yesterday's rally, sliding to $111,300 in recent trading from an overnight high of around $116,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on an array of consumer loans, fell to 4.02%, its lowest level in a month. Precious metals continue rising as many investors turn to safe-haven assets amid increasing stock market volatility and economic uncertainty. Gold futures were up 0.4% at $4,150 an ounce in recent trading, after hitting a record high of just under $4,200 earlier in the session. (Read here about how the surge in gold prices—the price of the precious metal is up nearly 60% since the start of the year—is leading a growing number consumers to sell gold jewelry, coins and other items.) Silver futures were also trading at an all-time high this morning, rising slightly to around $50.50 an ounce. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported better-than-expected earnings as the banking giant led a string of reports from major financial institutions. JPMorgan shares were up slightly in premarket trading after the bank reported a 9% rise in revenue and a 12% jump in profits as increased stock trading helped boost the results. Wells Fargo (WFC) shares rose 3% ahead of the bell after the bank reported strong net interest income and raised its profitability target. Goldman Sachs (GS) also reported revenue and earnings that came in ahead of expectations, though its shares dropped about 2.5%. Citigroup (C) shares were up 1% after its results beat estimates. General Motors (GM) said that its quarterly earnings next week will include a $1.6 billion charge associated with its electric vehicle business. The move comes after the U.S. ended its $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases. “Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” the automaker said in a filing. GM shares were down about 2% in premarket trading. Shares of U.S. rare earth mineral mining firms continued to gain in premarket trading after China threatened to restrict exports of the materials that are critical for high tech products. Shares of USA Rare Earth (USAR) were up 12% after gaining 19% yesterday. MP Materials (MP) shares were up 7% ahead of the bell, after soaring 21% in the prior session.

Title: From code to concrete: The new TCS playbook to build factories that power AI

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai/Bengaluru: There was no high-decibel government event, or even an investor roadshow. The message was tucked inside K. Krithivasan’s prepared remarks, in a recent media release. India’s largest IT services exporter, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the company Krithivasan now heads, is preparing for the biggest gamble of its five-decade existence: a massive $6.5 billion investment over six years to forge one gigawatt (GW) of new data centre capacity. Consider the sheer scale of ambition for a moment: This planned capacity alone is enough to match India’s entire current data centre base within six years, and the capital expenditure eclipses the combined value of all TCS acquisitions over the last two decades. That ambition also underlies a tectonic shift within TCS. For decades, the company exported code and consultancy, intangible services that powered global enterprises but left few physical footprints at home. Now, it is choosing to pour billions into concrete, steel and copper. The country’s most profitable IT exporter is turning inward, betting that India’s artificial intelligence (AI) revolution would need not just algorithms, but infrastructure. That shift is particularly striking given the group’s own history. Back in 2016, another Tata company, Tata Communications, effectively jettisoned its data centre play, deeming it “non-core." The sister concern sold 74% stake in its data centre business to a Temasek Holdings unit for $634 million. Three of those data centres were in Singapore; the rest across India. By last year, Tata Communications had divested its remaining 26%. Under chairman Cyrus Mistry, it seemed the group had moved on from the brick-and-mortar complexities of digital infrastructure. Under N. Chandrasekaran—the man who once put TCS on a high growth orbit—the pendulum has violently swung back. So when Krithivasan—himself a quiet engineer who inherited the corner office after Rajesh Gopinathan’s abrupt exit in 2023—outlined this unprecedented investment, it was more than a capex announcement. It signalled a philosophical reversal within the Tata ecosystem, a return to building the physical foundations of digital India. “The Tata Group companies are in power, real estate, project management businesses…So, there is a different kind of synergy we can build in here," Krithivasan said, during a call with analysts on 9 October. The timing, though, came against an uneasy backdrop. Ahead of TCS’s latest earnings, on 9 October, its stock was languishing near a 52-week low. Growth was tapering. Analysts at Motilal Oswal and Nuvama projected a full-year revenue decline—the first since TCS’s 2004 listing. The mood across India’s $283-billion IT industry was sombre. Global clients were trimming technology budgets, US visa restrictions had upended the traditional onsite-offshore model, and TCS had just confirmed the layoff of over 6,000 employees in the September quarter. In this subdued climate, the $6.5 billion commitment stood out as an act of economic courage, an attempt to reimagine TCS’s future rather than merely defend its margins. TCS did not respond to Mint’s detailed questionnaire seeking comments. April at the TajThe idea took shape earlier this year. In April, Chandrasekaran, who has been steadily integrating the Tata empire into a digital-industrial group, asked senior TCS executives to explore the data centre opportunity. It was a directive rooted in strategic timing as much as necessity. The same month, at a high-profile event in Delhi’s Taj Mansingh Hotel, TCS unveiled its ‘sovereign cloud network’, a service designed to store and process data entirely within Indian borders in compliance with new data-localization rules. It was a logical extension of TCS’s IT services portfolio: the company already provided engineers, managed IT infrastructure, and offered private cloud services. What it lacked was real estate—the physical layer of computing power that anchored the digital world. View Full Image In April this year, TCS unveiled its sovereign cloud network. (iStockphoto) That gap is precisely what the new investment aims to close. Data centres are the factories of the AI age—vast, secure facilities that house the servers, networking equipment and cooling systems needed to process and store the petabytes of data generated every day. India’s regulatory mandates and digital explosion have created a perfect storm of demand. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, now requires payment data to be stored domestically; the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets regulator, has similar stipulations for market participants. As 5G networks roll out and connected devices multiply, the volume of data produced by consumers, vehicles, and industrial systems is surging. Add the rise of generative AI, and the need for high-speed computing infrastructure becomes existential. TCS believes it can monetize this infrastructure in two ways: leasing capacity to hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, and using it for its own contracts with governments and enterprises. The company’s first 150 MW facility, to be built at a cost of $1 billion, is expected to go live within 18 months. Different from AccentureThe move also marks a clear break from how TCS’s global peers have evolved. Accenture, the $70-billion consulting giant, has doubled down on advisory-led AI and analytics rather than infrastructure. Its bet is that the profits lie in algorithms, not assets. Indian peers like Infosys and HCL Tech have largely taken the same path, positioning themselves as service orchestrators on top of third-party cloud platforms. On 13 October, HCL Tech announced that it had won $100 million in revenue from AI operations in the September quarter, making the Noida-based company the first among Big Five to quantify revenue from AI technologies. TCS, by contrast, is wading into the physical side of that digital stack. It is a high-stakes pivot that could recast its risk profile and profit structure. “The beauty of the data centre business is its recurring stability," said one executive familiar with the plan. “But it will test patience before delivering cash returns." The executive did not want to be identified. Dividend resetThe patience required may be considerable. Unlike software projects, data centres are capital-intensive, slow to scale and operationally demanding. TCS’s decision to build rather than rent puts it in competition with hyperscalers and domestic real-estate developers alike. The company is entering a field already crowded with global giants—Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon—as well as Indian powerhouses such as Reliance, AdaniConnex and Yotta. The irony is that, given its scale and client relationships, TCS should have been a natural candidate to own data centres years ago. Instead, it spent two decades returning wealth to shareholders— ₹3.66 trillion through dividends and buybacks since its listing. That generosity may now come at a cost. With the new investment cycle, margins could tighten, and dividend payouts to parent Tata Sons may moderate. Last year, TCS contributed 83% of Tata Sons’ income. Data centres can be bracketed into four types. First, there are the enterprise data centres, which are facilities owned and run by companies and houses their computing networks. A second category is hyperscale data centres, also known as Cloud data centres. Amazon and Microsoft own and manage these facilities. Edge data centres are the third category. Here, smaller facilities are set up closer to an organization, thereby improving speed, and are essential for real-time data processing tasks. Finally, there are the colocation data centres, a space TCS is venturing into. In this category, the data centre owner sets up the physical infrastructure, manages the facility, oversees the building, power, and cooling for the servers. The customer supplies and manages their equipment. View Full Image TCS is venturing into what is known as colocation data centres. McKinsey, a consulting firm, states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices since they also set up and have their own facilities. The operating margins of Equinix and Sify, who run colocation data centres, are in the range of 22% and 19%, respectively. In comparison, the operating margins enjoyed by AWS and Azure are significantly higher, at 35-37%. Executives say TCS’s balance sheet can absorb the shock. The company generated ₹46,449 crore in free cash flow last year, more than enough to underwrite the initial phases. Yet investors accustomed to industry-leading operating margins (TCS ended with 24.3% in operating margin last year) may need to reset expectations. The stock’s 3.5% dip in three days following the announcement suggests the market is already doing so. “TCS management stated that each 150-megawatt build-out phase of the data centre will require $1 billion capex, for a $6.5 billion total investment. We think this direction could offer new potential revenue streams though could negatively impact margins," Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 9 October. McKinsey states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices. Returns are slow, and could take a decade. In addition, technology cycles move faster than depreciation schedules. “This is an asset-intensive industry where labour-arbitrage advantages don’t translate," said Peter Bendor-Samuel of Everest Group, a research firm. “Investors used to high-margin, low-capex returns will need to recalibrate." Analysts at JM Financial estimated revenue from 1MW of operational data centres in the first year to be about ₹22 crore. TCS’s target of having a 150 MW data centre operational by April 2027 implies an incremental business of ₹3,300 crore. A successful operational capacity of 1 GW in six years would translate to about ₹22,000 crore, similar to its India revenue of ₹21,958 crore last year. The 3% problemThe deeper question is why TCS waited until now. For years, Indian conglomerates like Reliance and Adani have been laying the groundwork for data centre dominance, tying these projects to their energy and telecom networks. The global hyperscalers, meanwhile, have been expanding capacity across India as part of their global grids. The Tatas, cautious and conservative, stayed on the sidelines. Part of that hesitation stemmed from perception. Data centres were once viewed less as cutting-edge technology and more as glorified real-estate plays—capital-heavy, regulatory-ridden, and operationally messy. They required land, reliable electricity, and long-term financing, all of which had tripped up the Tata Group before. For a company built on intellectual capital, the business felt foreign. What has changed is the scale of the opportunity. India today accounts for roughly 20% of global data generation but only about 3% of storage capacity. Its total installed capacity—around one GW—is precisely what TCS aims to build by 2030. Analysts at Cushman & Wakefield estimate that India’s data centre capacity will triple to 1,825 megawatt (MW) by 2027, driven by new data-localization rules and the country’s voracious digital appetite. States are competing fiercely for investment. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are offering everything from electricity-duty waivers to land subsidies of up to 50%. Mumbai, with undersea cable landings and strong power grids, remains the favoured hub, but smaller cities are emerging as contenders. For TCS, whose domestic revenue still accounts for less than 10% of its total ($30.18 billion) but grew 62% last year—largely due to a ₹1.5-billion BSNL contract—the timing aligns with a broader strategic shift toward India-focused business. As global clients hesitate, India’s digital infrastructure push offers both stability and scale. The orchestraMeanwhile, the data centre gamble will not only test TCS’s financial muscle but execution capability as well. Building and operating data centres demands coordination across engineering, real estate, power management, and cybersecurity—far removed from writing code. Yet, this is where the Tata Group’s breadth could become a decisive advantage. TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies that rivals like Infosys or Wipro simply cannot replicate. “TCS has a unique opportunity to serve the broader Tata Group across businesses in telecom, networks, energy and cooling solutions," said Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at Catalincs, a consulting firm. “It can cross leverage these capabilities across the conglomerate structure, something that other large IT companies don’t have." TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies. Still, competition will be fierce. To find its niche, TCS must differentiate not by sheer size but by integration—offering clients a seamless bridge between the data centre and the AI workloads that run on it. “TCS is not trying to compete with AWS or Azure on a raw scale," said Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, a consulting firm. “It’s trying to own the intersection of infrastructure and services—both the data centre and the AI models that sit on top. That’s where the value will lie." Such integration could also help TCS reposition itself in the eyes of investors. Global data centre operators like Equinix and Digital Realty command enterprise-value multiples of 20 to 22 times Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), higher than Indian IT firms’ price-earnings ratios. If TCS can credibly present itself as both a technology and infrastructure play, it could attract a new class of investors seeking exposure to digital infrastructure. Still, this is not a business for those seeking quick wins. Like we mentioned earlier, data centres are a low margin play. Yet for TCS, this may be less about margins than momentum. The IT industry is at an inflection point: AI threatens to commoditize traditional outsourcing even as clients demand end-to-end digital transformation. Owning infrastructure offers TCS a new strategic lever, a way to control the stack from physical data to cognitive intelligence. “TCS’ moat won’t be real estate—it will be orchestration," said Fersht. “By owning the infrastructure, it can combine data engineering and AI services under one roof." Krithivasan’s wager, then, is not for immediate approval but for long-term relevance. As India’s data centre capacity surges and its AI ambitions swell, the company is positioning itself at the intersection of both trends. If it captures even a modest slice of the coming capacity boom, TCS could evolve from an outsourcing icon into a domestic infrastructure powerhouse. For the Tata Group, too, this is a return to form. From steel and power to software and satellites, its empire has always thrived on long horizons. The data centre bet is merely the digital reincarnation of that legacy. For Krithivasan, the challenge is deeply personal. He took charge in a moment of flux—after a surprise leadership exit, in a slowing industry, with AI rewriting the rules of competition. Now he must steer a company known for intangible efficiency into a world of tangible assets and operational grit. If he succeeds, TCS will not just sell cloud services—it will own a piece of the cloud itself. Key Takeaways TCS will spend $6.5 billion over six years to develop 1GW of data centre capacity. This planned capacity alone is enough to match India’s entire current data centre base. The investment is driven by the explosion of demand for high-speed computing infrastructure due to AI, and India’s data-localization rules that require data to be stored within her borders. The move is enabled by the Tata conglomerate's breadth—TCS plans to leverage sister companies like Tata Power and Tata Communications for power supply and connectivity. This marks a fundamental reversal for TCS; it is shifting from being an asset-light exporter of intangible code and services to becoming a capital-intensive physical infrastructure player. But, data centres are a low-margin, capex-intensive business with slow returns. This risks diluting TCS’ margins, forcing investors accustomed to high dividend payouts to recalibrate expectations. The idea took shape earlier this year. In April, Chandrasekaran, who has been steadily integrating the Tata empire into a digital-industrial group, asked senior TCS executives to explore the data centre opportunity. It was a directive rooted in strategic timing as much as necessity.

The executive did not want to be identified. Dividend resetThe patience required may be considerable. Unlike software projects, data centres are capital-intensive, slow to scale and operationally demanding. TCS’s decision to build rather than rent puts it in competition with hyperscalers and domestic real-estate developers alike. The company is entering a field already crowded with global giants—Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon—as well as Indian powerhouses such as Reliance, AdaniConnex and Yotta. The irony is that, given its scale and client relationships, TCS should have been a natural candidate to own data centres years ago. Instead, it spent two decades returning wealth to shareholders— ₹3.66 trillion through dividends and buybacks since its listing. That generosity may now come at a cost. With the new investment cycle, margins could tighten, and dividend payouts to parent Tata Sons may moderate. Last year, TCS contributed 83% of Tata Sons’ income. Data centres can be bracketed into four types. First, there are the enterprise data centres, which are facilities owned and run by companies and houses their computing networks. A second category is hyperscale data centres, also known as Cloud data centres. Amazon and Microsoft own and manage these facilities. Edge data centres are the third category. Here, smaller facilities are set up closer to an organization, thereby improving speed, and are essential for real-time data processing tasks. Finally, there are the colocation data centres, a space TCS is venturing into. In this category, the data centre owner sets up the physical infrastructure, manages the facility, oversees the building, power, and cooling for the servers. The customer supplies and manages their equipment. View Full Image TCS is venturing into what is known as colocation data centres. McKinsey, a consulting firm, states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices since they also set up and have their own facilities. The operating margins of Equinix and Sify, who run colocation data centres, are in the range of 22% and 19%, respectively. In comparison, the operating margins enjoyed by AWS and Azure are significantly higher, at 35-37%. Executives say TCS’s balance sheet can absorb the shock. The company generated ₹46,449 crore in free cash flow last year, more than enough to underwrite the initial phases. Yet investors accustomed to industry-leading operating margins (TCS ended with 24.3% in operating margin last year) may need to reset expectations. The stock’s 3.5% dip in three days following the announcement suggests the market is already doing so. “TCS management stated that each 150-megawatt build-out phase of the data centre will require $1 billion capex, for a $6.5 billion total investment. We think this direction could offer new potential revenue streams though could negatively impact margins," Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 9 October. McKinsey states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices. Returns are slow, and could take a decade. In addition, technology cycles move faster than depreciation schedules. “This is an asset-intensive industry where labour-arbitrage advantages don’t translate," said Peter Bendor-Samuel of Everest Group, a research firm. “Investors used to high-margin, low-capex returns will need to recalibrate." Analysts at JM Financial estimated revenue from 1MW of operational data centres in the first year to be about ₹22 crore. TCS’s target of having a 150 MW data centre operational by April 2027 implies an incremental business of ₹3,300 crore. A successful operational capacity of 1 GW in six years would translate to about ₹22,000 crore, similar to its India revenue of ₹21,958 crore last year. The 3% problemThe deeper question is why TCS waited until now. For years, Indian conglomerates like Reliance and Adani have been laying the groundwork for data centre dominance, tying these projects to their energy and telecom networks. The global hyperscalers, meanwhile, have been expanding capacity across India as part of their global grids. The Tatas, cautious and conservative, stayed on the sidelines. Part of that hesitation stemmed from perception. Data centres were once viewed less as cutting-edge technology and more as glorified real-estate plays—capital-heavy, regulatory-ridden, and operationally messy. They required land, reliable electricity, and long-term financing, all of which had tripped up the Tata Group before. For a company built on intellectual capital, the business felt foreign. What has changed is the scale of the opportunity. India today accounts for roughly 20% of global data generation but only about 3% of storage capacity. Its total installed capacity—around one GW—is precisely what TCS aims to build by 2030. Analysts at Cushman & Wakefield estimate that India’s data centre capacity will triple to 1,825 megawatt (MW) by 2027, driven by new data-localization rules and the country’s voracious digital appetite. States are competing fiercely for investment. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are offering everything from electricity-duty waivers to land subsidies of up to 50%. Mumbai, with undersea cable landings and strong power grids, remains the favoured hub, but smaller cities are emerging as contenders. For TCS, whose domestic revenue still accounts for less than 10% of its total ($30.18 billion) but grew 62% last year—largely due to a ₹1.5-billion BSNL contract—the timing aligns with a broader strategic shift toward India-focused business. As global clients hesitate, India’s digital infrastructure push offers both stability and scale. The orchestraMeanwhile, the data centre gamble will not only test TCS’s financial muscle but execution capability as well. Building and operating data centres demands coordination across engineering, real estate, power management, and cybersecurity—far removed from writing code. Yet, this is where the Tata Group’s breadth could become a decisive advantage. TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies that rivals like Infosys or Wipro simply cannot replicate. “TCS has a unique opportunity to serve the broader Tata Group across businesses in telecom, networks, energy and cooling solutions," said Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at Catalincs, a consulting firm. “It can cross leverage these capabilities across the conglomerate structure, something that other large IT companies don’t have." TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies. Still, competition will be fierce. To find its niche, TCS must differentiate not by sheer size but by integration—offering clients a seamless bridge between the data centre and the AI workloads that run on it. “TCS is not trying to compete with AWS or Azure on a raw scale," said Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, a consulting firm. “It’s trying to own the intersection of infrastructure and services—both the data centre and the AI models that sit on top. That’s where the value will lie." Such integration could also help TCS reposition itself in the eyes of investors. Global data centre operators like Equinix and Digital Realty command enterprise-value multiples of 20 to 22 times Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), higher than Indian IT firms’ price-earnings ratios. If TCS can credibly present itself as both a technology and infrastructure play, it could attract a new class of investors seeking exposure to digital infrastructure. Still, this is not a business for those seeking quick wins. Like we mentioned earlier, data centres are a low margin play. Yet for TCS, this may be less about margins than momentum. The IT industry is at an inflection point: AI threatens to commoditize traditional outsourcing even as clients demand end-to-end digital transformation. Owning infrastructure offers TCS a new strategic lever, a way to control the stack from physical data to cognitive intelligence. “TCS’ moat won’t be real estate—it will be orchestration," said Fersht. “By owning the infrastructure, it can combine data engineering and AI services under one roof." Krithivasan’s wager, then, is not for immediate approval but for long-term relevance. As India’s data centre capacity surges and its AI ambitions swell, the company is positioning itself at the intersection of both trends. If it captures even a modest slice of the coming capacity boom, TCS could evolve from an outsourcing icon into a domestic infrastructure powerhouse. For the Tata Group, too, this is a return to form. From steel and power to software and satellites, its empire has always thrived on long horizons. The data centre bet is merely the digital reincarnation of that legacy. For Krithivasan, the challenge is deeply personal. He took charge in a moment of flux—after a surprise leadership exit, in a slowing industry, with AI rewriting the rules of competition. Now he must steer a company known for intangible efficiency into a world of tangible assets and operational grit. If he succeeds, TCS will not just sell cloud services—it will own a piece of the cloud itself. Key Takeaways TCS will spend $6.5 billion over six years to develop 1GW of data centre capacity. This planned capacity alone is enough to match India’s entire current data centre base. The investment is driven by the explosion of demand for high-speed computing infrastructure due to AI, and India’s data-localization rules that require data to be stored within her borders. The move is enabled by the Tata conglomerate's breadth—TCS plans to leverage sister companies like Tata Power and Tata Communications for power supply and connectivity. This marks a fundamental reversal for TCS; it is shifting from being an asset-light exporter of intangible code and services to becoming a capital-intensive physical infrastructure player. But, data centres are a low-margin, capex-intensive business with slow returns. This risks diluting TCS’ margins, forcing investors accustomed to high dividend payouts to recalibrate expectations. The move also marks a clear break from how TCS’s global peers have evolved. Accenture, the $70-billion consulting giant, has doubled down on advisory-led AI and analytics rather than infrastructure. Its bet is that the profits lie in algorithms, not assets. Indian peers like Infosys and HCL Tech have largely taken the same path, positioning themselves as service orchestrators on top of third-party cloud platforms. On 13 October, HCL Tech announced that it had won $100 million in revenue from AI operations in the September quarter, making the Noida-based company the first among Big Five to quantify revenue from AI technologies.

Owning infrastructure offers TCS a new strategic lever, a way to control the stack from physical data to cognitive intelligence. “TCS’ moat won’t be real estate—it will be orchestration," said Fersht. “By owning the infrastructure, it can combine data engineering and AI services under one roof." Krithivasan’s wager, then, is not for immediate approval but for long-term relevance. As India’s data centre capacity surges and its AI ambitions swell, the company is positioning itself at the intersection of both trends. If it captures even a modest slice of the coming capacity boom, TCS could evolve from an outsourcing icon into a domestic infrastructure powerhouse. For the Tata Group, too, this is a return to form. From steel and power to software and satellites, its empire has always thrived on long horizons. The data centre bet is merely the digital reincarnation of that legacy. For Krithivasan, the challenge is deeply personal. He took charge in a moment of flux—after a surprise leadership exit, in a slowing industry, with AI rewriting the rules of competition. Now he must steer a company known for intangible efficiency into a world of tangible assets and operational grit. If he succeeds, TCS will not just sell cloud services—it will own a piece of the cloud itself. Key Takeaways TCS will spend $6.5 billion over six years to develop 1GW of data centre capacity. This planned capacity alone is enough to match India’s entire current data centre base. The investment is driven by the explosion of demand for high-speed computing infrastructure due to AI, and India’s data-localization rules that require data to be stored within her borders. The move is enabled by the Tata conglomerate's breadth—TCS plans to leverage sister companies like Tata Power and Tata Communications for power supply and connectivity. This marks a fundamental reversal for TCS; it is shifting from being an asset-light exporter of intangible code and services to becoming a capital-intensive physical infrastructure player. But, data centres are a low-margin, capex-intensive business with slow returns. This risks diluting TCS’ margins, forcing investors accustomed to high dividend payouts to recalibrate expectations. Meanwhile, the data centre gamble will not only test TCS’s financial muscle but execution capability as well. Building and operating data centres demands coordination across engineering, real estate, power management, and cybersecurity—far removed from writing code. Yet, this is where the Tata Group’s breadth could become a decisive advantage. TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies that rivals like Infosys or Wipro simply cannot replicate. “TCS has a unique opportunity to serve the broader Tata Group across businesses in telecom, networks, energy and cooling solutions," said Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at Catalincs, a consulting firm. “It can cross leverage these capabilities across the conglomerate structure, something that other large IT companies don’t have." Still, competition will be fierce. To find its niche, TCS must differentiate not by sheer size but by integration—offering clients a seamless bridge between the data centre and the AI workloads that run on it. “TCS is not trying to compete with AWS or Azure on a raw scale," said Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, a consulting firm. “It’s trying to own the intersection of infrastructure and services—both the data centre and the AI models that sit on top. That’s where the value will lie." Such integration could also help TCS reposition itself in the eyes of investors. Global data centre operators like Equinix and Digital Realty command enterprise-value multiples of 20 to 22 times Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), higher than Indian IT firms’ price-earnings ratios. If TCS can credibly present itself as both a technology and infrastructure play, it could attract a new class of investors seeking exposure to digital infrastructure. Still, this is not a business for those seeking quick wins. Like we mentioned earlier, data centres are a low margin play. Yet for TCS, this may be less about margins than momentum. The IT industry is at an inflection point: AI threatens to commoditize traditional outsourcing even as clients demand end-to-end digital transformation.

Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune. He was previously the editor-in-chief of Business Insider's news division and the founding editor of Business Insider UK. His investigative journalism has changed the law in two U.S. federal districts and two states. The U.S. Supreme Court cited his work on the death penalty in the concurrence to Baze v. Rees, the ruling on whether lethal injection is cruel or unusual. He also won the Neal award for an investigation of bribes and kickbacks on Madison Avenue. A broad-based selloff swept global stock markets this morning after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the Financial Times that China “will be hurt the most” if it doesn’t submit to Washington’s trade demands. At the same time, China showed no signs of backing down from President Trump’s trade war: It imposed sanctions banning Chinese companies from doing business with the U.S. subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean. South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.63% on the news. S&P 500 futures were down 0.87% this morning. The index opened the better part of 1% lower almost immediately. Markets in Asia and Europe were almost all down, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 off 2.58% and Europe’s Stoxx 600 down 0.49% by midmorning. Beijing’s new export controls on rare earth materials—which the U.S. is dependent on—are “a sign of how weak their economy is, and they want to pull everybody else down with them,” Bessent said. “Maybe there is some Leninist business model where hurting your customers is a good idea, but they are the largest supplier to the world,” he told the FT. “If they want to slow down the global economy, they will be hurt the most. “They are in the middle of a recession/depression,” he added, “and they are trying to export their way out of it. The problem is they’re exacerbating their standing in the world.” (China is, in fact, doing very well. Its exports rose 8.3% in September, and the World Bank expects China’s GDP to grow 4.8% this year. U.S. growth is forecast at 1.4%.) The mood among traders today is a stark reversal from yesterday, when the S&P 500 rose 1.56% after investors realized that Trump and China President Xi Jinping will likely meet at the upcoming APEC conference at the end of October—an opportunity for both men to reach one of Trump’s famous deals. Elsewhere, there wasn’t much to cheer up the markets. A third of bettors on Polymarket think the U.S. government shutdown will continue beyond Nov. 8. Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that consumer sentiment remains low: The University of Michigan’s consumer survey, which asks whether buyers feel now is a good time to make a major purchase, lately “points to year-over-year growth in this measure of core spending slowing to near-zero soon, a far cry from the 6% pace earlier this year,” according to Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen. Goldman Sachs added to the gloom by publishing a note this morning titled “Jobless growth.” “The modest job growth alongside robust GDP growth seen recently is likely to be normal to some degree in the years ahead. We expect the great majority of U.S. potential GDP growth to come from solid productivity growth boosted by advances in artificial intelligence, with only a modest contribution from labor supply growth due to population aging and lower immigration,” authors Pierfrancesco Mei and David Mericle said. In the longer term, however, most analysts continue to see stocks going up, driven largely by the tech and AI sector. “Roughly half of this S&P 500 bull has been driven by just seven stocks: Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA),” Jeff Buchbinder and Adam Turnquist of LPL Financial told clients in a note. But “the Fed is in the middle of a rate-cutting cycle, and inflation appears to be under control despite increased tariffs, likely eliminating that as a potential bull market killer.” Here’s a snapshot of the markets this morning: © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Members Portal A pop quiz of trivia from the previous 19 years of Skeptoid shows! Can you beat the masters? Skeptoid Podcast #1010Filed under Feedback & Questions by Brian DunningOctober 14, 2025 Sponsor an episode! We've just celebrated the 19th birthday of Skeptoid — 19 straight years of weekly shows, and that's pretty cool. So experienced Skeptoid listeners know what that means for today's show: it's time for a pop quiz, with one question from each of the previous 19 years. And no, you don't have to have listened to every show for that long; you just need a good solid foundation of science literacy and critical thinking. Which obviously you have — or you wouldn't be a Skeptoid listener! Keep track of your score; we're going to give you a ranking at the end. So here we go. If you're listening with someone and find yourselves needing a moment to confer after any question, then you are encouraged to push the pause button and deliberate as long as necessary: Of the many pseudoscientific medical benefits professed by some sellers of wheatgrass juice is the false claim that drinking it can remove toxic heavy metals from your system. What medical procedure can actually do this? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, chelation therapy. A chelating agent such as EDTA is administered intravenously and bonds to the heavy metal, which can then be excreted through the urine. American journalist Michael Drosnin shocked the world in 1994 with the publication of The Bible Code, in which he announced that he'd found many historic events foretold in the Bible using a previously undiscovered hidden code. What relatively simple encoding method did he claim was used? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, Equidistant Letter Spacing. Pick a number, say 25, then take every 25th letter from a text. Those letters spell out your messages. Using computer programs, it's been found that virtually any short message you want can be found in virtually any long book-length text using this technique. Before this world's largest scientific instrument came online in 2010, crackpots everywhere were predicting that it would destroy the Earth, by either creating microscopic black holes, strangelets, or magnetic monopoles. It did not do any of those things — but it did help us discover the Higgs boson. Where is the collider located? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, CERN, just outside of Geneva. Fears among the scientifically illiterate became so widespread that lawsuits seeking court orders to stop CERN were filed worldwide. All failed, as none of the plaintiffs were knowledgeable enough to demonstrate any credible threat. Everyone in the country hates changing our clocks twice a year. So what is, in fact, the real reason that we torment ourselves with Daylight Saving Time? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, shopping. In much of the country, it's cold for half the year so nobody goes out shopping in the evening anyway; but they do in the summer. Giving them one extra hour before the retailers' closing times means more sales are made and more tax revenue generated. Half of you are going to argue with me on this and say it's one of the others, but the official reasons can be found in my references. In 1966, the Department of Transportation (which is in charge of this for some reason) created the Uniform Time Act of 1966 which stated this as "Convenience of commerce." This region of high radiation, where the inner Van Allen radiation belt dips closest to Earth, got some publicity in 2009 when some blamed its effects for causing the crash of Air France flight 447. Which of the following is true about the South Atlantic Anomaly? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C. The closest the Anomaly dips to the Earth is about 200 km, at which point it's very small; and the highest flying airliners might get as high as 15 km. About 19 years after the Bounty mutineers settled on Pitcairn Island, the island was visited by the crew of an American whaling ship. How many of the British sailors still survived? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, one: John Adams. Of the nine British sailors, six Tahitian men, eleven Tahitian women, and one baby who had landed there, only Adams and nine of the women still remained (plus nineteen children) — the others having been killed in fierce infighting. In 2008, a large double-blinded study was done with 21 contestants from the Eighth International Violin Competition using nine top quality violins, ranging from brand new instruments to multimillion-dollar classics including two Strads and a Guarneri (another Italian classic, contemporary to the Strads). The musicians tested exhaustively according to strict protocols in which they could neither clearly see nor smell the instruments they played. Which was the most preferred instrument? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, one of the new violins. The Stradivarius in the test that had the most illustrious history was the least preferred. For that most preferred new one, seven couldn't tell if it was old or new, seven wrongly guessed that it was old, and only three correctly guessed that it was new. Ganzfeld experiments are one type of test for psychic powers. How does this one work? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, one person tries to visualize an object the other person is concentrating on. Proponents consistently claim a better-than-random-chance success rate; skeptics always find methodological errors like inadequate blinding and sensory leakage. When Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay summited Mt. Everest for the first time in 1953, it was to some controversy; as many have long maintained that two other British men had succeeded first in 1924, yet died on their return. Who were they? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. If you guessed Eric Shipton, you were close; Shipton was a last-minute cut from Hillary and Norgay's famous 1953 expedition, but he'd been on most of the expeditions since the 1930s. He's best known for being the guy who faked a famous photo of a "yeti footprint" next to an ice axe for scale, which he did in 1951. In 1854, Sir John Franklin embarked upon his fourth and final polar voyage. Unfortunately it ended in disaster: both ships sank, nobody survived, and evidence remained that a few of the survivors may have resorted to cannibalism. Much of this evidence was discovered on what island? Reveal the answer The correct answer is B, Beechey Island in the Canadian Arctic. This voyage was to find a fabled Northwest Passage, a way to sail between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans via an ice-free route through the Arctic Ocean across the top of North America, rather than having to go halfway round the world to traverse Cape Horn. So islands in the Canadian Arctic were the only possible correct answer. This small forested grove in Romania is only about 3 km². It was made famous to Americans in 2014 when a team of TV ghost hunters drove into it. One pretended to have an unprovoked panic attack. They brought along a commercially sold ghost hunting detector device, which detected nothing. They panicked and fled. While their contribution to the mythology was essentially meritless, they did bring up one case of a 5-year-old girl who went missing in the forest once. Which of the following is true? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, the area of the park is so small that it would be virtually impossible for anyone to go missing within it. Consequently there are no records of it ever having happened. The first emperor of a unified China left a lot to remember him by, not just the original Great Wall of China, but also his vast mausoleum complex, home to the Terra Cotta warriors, a vast map of the world in miniature complete with liquid mercury representing its oceans, and a massive central pyramid. Which of these three pyramids is the largest, by volume? Reveal the answer The correct answer is B, Qin Shi Huang's pyramid was indeed the biggest of these three, by volume. At 3.1 million m³, it was about 20% bigger than the Great Pyramid of Khufu at 2.6 million m³. Although Monk's Mound has about the same footprint as the Great Pyramid, it's only about a quarter the volume. The world's biggest is the Great Pyramid of Cholula in Mexico, at 4.5 million m³. The so-called Baghdad Battery is a small terra cotta pot discovered in 1936, probably between 1300 and 2200 years old. Its designation as a battery (which is obviously false) has come from alternative historians and ancient advanced culture theorists. What is it really? Reveal the answer The correct answer is B. It's essentially identical to many other scroll containers, many of which have been found with their scrolls intact. The giveaway is the residue of asphalt around its lip, which was used to seal such containers and preserve the scrolls within. If you visit the Catherine Palace south of St. Petersburg, you can go and visit a faithful replica of the fabulous Amber Room, gifted to Peter the Great in 1716 by King Frederick William I. The original was initially lost in World War II, during the scuffle to hide artworks and other treasures from the invading Nazis in 1941. What was ultimately its fate? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, it was destroyed when the advancing Red Army razed Königsberg Castle in Germany, burning it completely to the ground in 1944. The room had been on display there, and the German curators disassembled it and packed it into nondescript crates for evacuation — but it was too late. Unfortunately for the Soviets, the average infantryman knew or cared little about current developments in art history. It's reasonably well known that the Holy Grail became a part of Christian mythology after the Bible; it came from Arthurian lore. In what publication did the principal character Perceval make his first appearance, so far as we've been able to find? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, The Story of the Grail from 1190. Following Geoffery of Monmouth's book, the 1100s were full of pulp fan fiction about King Arthur, and it does appear that this poem is where Perceval and the Grail both made their debuts. Interestingly, it is incomplete, as its author literally died mid-sentence. And OK, yeah, this was probably too hard of a question. In 1959, Canada's magnificent Avro F-105 Arrow was inexplicably canceled. Only a few having been built, then immediately destroyed, the Arrow was the world's best and most advanced interceptor: capable of taking off, pursuing and overtaking enemy bombers, and shooting them down. The reason was that, with the advent of ICBMs, interceptors were simply no longer relevant. The conspiracy theories melt away when you note that an American interceptor concept, largely identical to the Arrow, was canceled at about the same time. What was it? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, the XF-108 Rapier, from North American. This is kind of an unfair question if you're not an aerospace nerd. The North American XB-70 Valkyrie was a bomber, not an interceptor; and the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar was a proposed spaceplane, a followup to the record-setting X-15. Yes, it had a dumb name, because it sounded like "dinosaur", but it was Dyna (like dynamite) and Soar (like fly). JPL co-founder Jack Parsons is somewhat notorious for his lifestyle outside of work, in which he led a chapter of a mysticism order from his large house in which some of the members lived, called the Parsonage. What future cult leader lived at the Parsonage for a time? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, L. Ron Hubbard, who went on to found the Church of Scientology. Hubbard and Parsons' girlfriend, Sara "Betty" Northrup, ran off together with $10,000 of Parsons' money. Nibiru is said to be the name of a rogue planet that could swing past Earth at some point and cause massive destruction. Other stories surround the so-called Planet X. Planet X and Nibiru are not the same thing; both have distinct backstories and predictions associated with them. They could be purely fictional, or they could be theoretical, based on actual astronomical observations. Which of the following is true? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, Nibiru is fictional and Planet X is hypothetical. Nibiru was the brainchild of broad-spectrum wooist and alternative historian Zecharia Sitchin, who published it in a fact-free book series called The Earth Chronicles, which started with The 12th Planet in 1976. Planet X, on the other hand, was the name given by famed astronomer Percival Lowell to a hypothetical body that he (and others) believed would account for perturbations in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. For quite some time after his death, the subsequent discovery of Pluto was believed to account for this. That was later disproven, but only when the Voyager 2 mission made better measurements of Neptune's mass, many decades later. "Excited delirium" is a cause of death sometimes attributed to people who died being arrested, usually young black men. It is not a real medical diagnosis and its origin has been traced to the manufacturer of what police equipment? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, tasers. The condition was first described in a white paper published by the American College of Emergency Physicians, written by a task force, three of whose members were found to have been consultants paid by Taser International, since renamed Axon Enterprise. Some states are now banning "excited delirium" from being listed as a cause of death. OK, let's see how you did!

Title: OpenAI taps Broadcom to build its first AI processor in latest chip deal

Time Published: 2025-10-14T04:37:19Z
Full Content:
OpenAI has partnered with Broadcom to produce its first in-house artificial intelligence processors, the latest chip tie-up for the ChatGPT maker as it races to secure the computing power needed to meet surging demand for its services. Shares of Broadcom rose more than 10%. The companies said on Monday that OpenAI would design the chips, which Broadcom will develop and deploy starting in the second half of 2026. They will roll out 10 gigawatts worth of custom chips, whose power consumption is roughly equivalent to the needs of more than 8 million U.S. households or five times the electricity produced by the Hoover Dam. Most analysts do not expect the deal, the latest effort by a tech company to develop custom AI chips, to challenge Nvidia’s grip on the AI accelerator market, given the significant challenge of designing, scaling and manufacturing in-house chips from the ground up. The OpenAI-Broadcom deal is the latest in a string of massive chip investments that have highlighted the technology industry’s surging appetite for computing power as it races to build the most sophisticated AI systems. OpenAI last week unveiled a 6-gigawatt AI chip supply deal with AMD that includes an option to buy a stake in the chipmaker, days after disclosing that Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in the startup and provide it with data-center systems with at least 10 gigawatts of capacity. “Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI’s potential,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the deal. A one-gigawatt data center can cost between $50 billion and $60 billion, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in August, adding that Nvidia products, powering the data center, can represent more than half of those costs. The 2026 timeline set out by OpenAI for the build-out is aggressive, but the startup is also best positioned to raise the funds required for the project, given the heights of investor confidence, said Gadjo Sevilla, an analyst at eMarketer. “Financing such a large chip deal will likely require a combination of funding rounds, pre-orders, strategic investments, and support from Microsoft, as well as leveraging future revenue streams and potential credit facilities.” The tie-up with Broadcom, first reported by Reuters last year, places OpenAI among cloud-computing giants such as Alphabet-owned Google and Amazon.com that are developing custom chips to meet surging AI demand and reduce dependence on costly, supply-constrained Nvidia processors. However, similar efforts by Microsoft and Meta have failed to match the performance of Nvidia chips, according to media reports. Still, the rise in demand for custom chips has turned Broadcom into one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, with its stock price rising nearly six-fold since the end of 2022. Broadcom unveiled a $10 billion custom AI chip order in September from an unnamed new customer, which some analysts speculated was OpenAI. However, a company executive on Monday alluded that OpenAI was not that unnamed client. Broadcom and OpenAI said on Monday that the deployment of the new custom chips would be completed by the end of 2029, building on their existing co-development and supply agreements. The new systems will be scaled entirely using Broadcom’s Ethernet and other networking gear, challenging Nvidia’s InfiniBand networking solution. US President Donald Trump claims that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to stop purchasing Russian oil, after the US imposed tariffs on India for those imports. Trump plans to pressure China to do the same in an effort to cut off Moscow's energy revenues. He also speaks highly of his relationship with PM Modi and their recent discussions regarding India's imports of Russian oil.

A subscription may be required for some services. Share The pace of AI innovation is accelerating, and with the launch of Red Hat AI 3, we're reminded that turning this potential into enterprise reality requires a robust, open ecosystem built on choice and collaboration. Our goal has always been to provide a consistent, powerful platform for AI that works with any model, on any accelerator, and across the hybrid cloud. Today, we're thrilled to highlight the momentum from our partners, who are working alongside us to build out the future of open, hybrid AI on Red Hat. The Red Hat partner ecosystem is the engine that will deliver the generative AI (gen AI) and agentic capabilities that customers need for broad market adoption. It’s about bringing together the best in hardware, software, and services to create a whole that is far greater than the sum of its parts. The launch of Red Hat AI 3 is centered on driving enterprise AI inference, expanding model choice and enabling open models for optimized cost and flexibility – so organizations can go from training to “doing.” And Red Hat partners play a critical role in making this happen. To deliver AI inference at scale using vLLM and Kubernetes, the llm-d open source project is now generally available as part of Red Hat OpenShift AI 3.0, powered by a coalition of leading gen AI model providers, AI accelerators and premier AI cloud platforms. Founding contributors include CoreWeave, Google Cloud, IBM Research, and NVIDIA, with additional support from partners like AMD, Cisco, Hugging Face, Intel, Lambda, and Mistral AI. Since the project’s introduction earlier this year, Microsoft, Oracle and WEKA have also become active contributing members. Nilesh Patel Chief Strategy Officer, WEKA As Large Language Models (LLMs) become the foundation for a wide range of gen AI applications, Red Hat is introducing the Partner Model Validation Guide to empower our partners and provide greater choice to customers. This guide outlines a standardized, step-by-step process for Red Hat partners to benchmark their LLMs for inclusion in the Red Hat OpenShift AI model catalog. Leveraging the Partner Model Validation Guide, model provider partners can generate the data needed for validation using a prescribed open source toolchain, including vLLM for serving, GuideLLM for performance benchmarking, and LM Evaluation Harness for accuracy evaluations. Once submitted and validated by our team, these partner models, complete with their performance and quality metrics, will be made visible and available to all Red Hat OpenShift AI customers. This initiative enriches our model catalog, offering customers more transparent insights and guidance at the model level, a broader selection of best-in-class open source models to build their AI applications, and market visibility for our model provider partners. Ultimately, the goal is to get AI applications into production where they can deliver business value. Red Hat AI, combined with our partner ecosystem, provides the essential capabilities for developing, deploying, and managing agentic AI. This is where our systems integrators and services partners play a crucial role. Red Hat is engaged with global leaders like Accenture, HCL, Kyndryl, IBM Consulting, Infosys and NTT DATA to support customers in scaling these applications and optimizing inference to run AI everywhere – from the datacenter to the edge. With a solid foundation and enabled infrastructure, the focus shifts to the tools and models that power intelligent applications. An AI strategy is only as good as the ecosystem of data platforms, vector databases, security tools, and developer utilities that support it. Red Hat’s partner landscape is rich and diverse, providing the essential components for building modern AI workflows. With the launch of Red Hat AI 3, we've curated a collection of MCP servers. This enables ISVs to connect their tools and services directly to Red Hat AI. Partners like CyberArk, Dynatrace, Elastic, EnterpriseDB, Palo Alto Networks, and others are working with Red Hat to showcase their MCP servers, helping customers build sophisticated agentic applications with trusted tools. Steve Kearns General Manager, Search Solutions, Elastic Wolfgang Heider Product Lead Software Delivery, Dynatrace Red Hat’s work with Meta’s open source Llama Stack is foundational to empowering developers with Red Hat AI 3. By actively contributing to this open source project, Red Hat and its partners are helping to enhance a complete set of standardized tools that revolutionize the gen AI application lifecycle. This helps ensure developers have a compelling, robust, and adaptable environment to accelerate the creation and deployment of innovative AI solutions, giving our partners and customers a clear path to production. By reducing the complexity of integrating various AI services and tools, Llama Stack enables developers to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure challenges. Options are important to cover the widest range of capabilities, which is why we've deepened our collaborations with accelerator partners like AMD, Google Cloud, and Intel. We’re working with NVIDIA to integrate NVIDIA’s performance-optimized AI computing, networking, and software with Red Hat AI, helping customers to build, deploy, and manage AI at scale and optimize infrastructure across diverse workloads. Red Hat and NVIDIA continue to drive the expansion of AI infrastructure with the support for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 infrastructure, targeting high-end AI training and inference at scale. Furthermore, the NVIDIA RTX PRO(R) 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs support Red Hat AI, Red Hat OpenShift, and Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, accelerating a range of enterprise workloads, including enterprise AI and VDI graphics, with air-cooled GPUs and servers. Our collaboration with AMD is powering more efficient gen AI by enabling AMD’s portfolio of x86-based processors and GPUs on Red Hat AI, driven by our activations in upstream communities like vLLM and llm-d to deliver enhanced performance and GPU support. In addition, Red Hat continues to build upon its longstanding collaboration with Intel to support Red Hat AI across its expanding hardware platform and accelerator portfolio, including Intel® Gaudi® AI accelerators. This commitment to choice extends across the hybrid cloud. In this area, we are actively working with Google Cloud to bolster TPU support on Red Hat AI, extending our shared vision for community-powered innovation through projects like llm-d and vLLM. But accelerators are just one piece of the puzzle. Customers need validated, integrated solutions. That's where our OEM server partners come in, transforming the theoretical potential of AI into tangible enterprise reality. While the foundation of AI lies in accelerators on the bottom and language models on the top, the practical deployment and management of AI at scale requires robust, integrated solutions. Red Hat is actively collaborating with industry leaders, including Cisco, Dell Technologies, HPE, and Lenovo, to simplify the deployment and management of AI across hybrid cloud environments. With Dell, we are working to help ensure that their powerful server and storage solutions are optimized for Red Hat AI, providing customers with reliable and scalable infrastructure for their AI workloads.

Title: Carbon credits are failing to help with climate change — here’s why
URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03313-z
Time Published: 2025-10-14T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
Achieving the global temperature targets set in the Paris climate agreement requires deep, rapid cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, and therefore the swift phase-out of fossil fuels. Many factors stand in the way. One of the most pernicious is carbon offsets. Offsets are tradable credits from projects that claim to reduce emissions, either by avoiding them or by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Businesses and countries trade these credits — each representing the equivalent of one tonne of CO2 — to ‘neutralize’ their own emissions. Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise Although conceptually appealing, this reliance on offsets has fatal flaws. In practice, it’s difficult to ensure that they represent real emissions reductions rather than ‘hot air’, with the claimed climate benefits existing only on paper. Equally challenging is ensuring that emission reductions are ‘additional’, meaning that they would not have occurred without the incentive provided by the sale of carbon credits. For projects credited for sequestering carbon, it is also crucial to ensure that the CO2 is locked away permanently and not released back into the atmosphere later. Most carbon-offset schemes fall foul of one or more of these requirements. Thus, offsets undermine decarbonization by enabling companies and countries to claim that emissions have been reduced when they have not. This results in more emissions, delays the phase-out of fossil fuels and diverts scarce resources to false solutions. Yet, climate-policy processes continue to rely on them. The operationalization of Article 6 of the Paris agreement and full implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, both achieved in 2024, are set to turbocharge demand for carbon credits. In parallel, voluntary carbon markets are promising to raise standards as a way of further legitimizing and scaling up offsets. Of greatest concern is the expanding role of offsets in domestic carbon-pricing schemes, such as emissions trading and carbon taxes. Although the European Union’s Emissions Trading System phased out offsets in 2020, they still feature in most major carbon-pricing schemes outside Europe, including in China, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, California, Canada and Australia. They are even permitted as a substitute for paying carbon taxes in countries such as South Africa, Mexico, Chile and Colombia. Such practices threaten to undermine global decarbonization efforts. Low-quality offsets artificially depress carbon prices, which dilutes the incentive for industries to cut their emissions and weakens the effectiveness of carbon-pricing schemes. Here, we outline the problems and call on decision makers to exclude offsets from carbon-pricing schemes. Carbon offsetting sounds simple on paper. In practice, it is anything but. It is extremely difficult to evaluate the emission reductions achieved by offset projects because calculations require comparing outcomes with ‘business-as-usual’ projections. For example, calculating the climate benefits from a project that avoids deforestation involves comparing a forest’s actual carbon stock to that in a counterfactual scenario in which the project did not happen. The hypothetical nature of such calculations invites manipulation and can tempt project developers to overestimate business-as-usual emissions to generate more credits. Heatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies Heatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies Fundamental imbalances in the information used in offset schemes leave them vulnerable to these outcomes. In most cases, only project leaders and developers know whether their projects are dependent on credit revenues and are therefore truly additional. This makes it difficult for administrators to screen out shoddy projects. Even where projects are additional, errors can arise from inaccurate measurement of emissions and carbon stocks. These risks are most acute when the sources and sinks are variable. For example, stocks of soil organic carbon vary naturally across landscapes and through time. This is a product of diversity in soil characteristics, topography and vegetation cover, as well as in seasonal, annual and decadal changes in temperatures and rainfall. The variability makes it difficult to accurately measure changes in the carbon stock and ensure that the credited carbon storage is fully attributable to the project1. It is also difficult to ensure that credited carbon removals remain sequestered. Many carbon sinks are susceptible to natural disturbances, such as droughts and wildfires, which can release carbon stored in trees and soils. Carbon stocks can also be lost through the clearing of vegetation and other changes in land-management practices. Despite these risks, most offset schemes mandate that credited sinks be maintained for only 40 years or even less. Given that CO2 emissions require thousands of years to be reabsorbed by Earth’s climate system2, credited removals need to lock away carbon for a similar period to genuinely neutralize the warming caused by the emissions that are claimed to be offset. In most markets, the risks associated with the supply of low-quality goods and services can be alleviated if consumers are able to judge quality and seek redress when standards are not met. With offsets, however, the complexity and a lack of transparency make it close to impossible for buyers to make informed decisions about the quality of most credits. Moreover, many buyers are not incentivized to care. Typically, their priority is to procure credits at the lowest possible cost, a fact evidenced by a 2024 study revealing that the largest corporate buyers consistently choose low-priced credits over higher-quality alternatives3. Why the green-technology race might not save the planet Why the green-technology race might not save the planet For these reasons, the integrity of offset schemes hinges on the skills and efforts of administrators, but they are often incentivized to prioritize supply over integrity. In voluntary offset markets, registries rely on project registrations and credit issuances for revenue, while competing with one another for market share. Tightening integrity standards can therefore reduce revenue and put this business model at risk. Government-regulated offset programmes linked to carbon-pricing schemes show a similar dynamic. The main reason that pricing schemes allow the use of offsets is to lower compliance costs for polluters, thereby reducing resistance to climate policies4. Yet the focus on cost reduction places pressure on regulators to ensure a plentiful supply of low-cost credits, frequently at the expense of environmental integrity. These interlinked issues make integrity failings inevitable. The science reflects this, with studies repeatedly showing that few of the major offset types in use today deliver real, additional or permanent abatement. A 2024 meta-analysis examining some 2,300 offset projects — amounting to around one-fifth of all issued credits — found that less than 16% achieved the emissions reductions claimed by developers5. In-depth evaluations of avoided deforestation6, renewable energy7 and clean cooking-stove projects8 have also exposed persistent problems with additionality, inaccurate measurement and impermanence. Recognizing these flaws, some stakeholders advocate a shift from projects that avoid emissions to those that remove carbon from the atmosphere. However, carbon-removal projects tend to have similar integrity problems. Engineering-based techniques are scarce, and so most removal projects currently involve less durable nature-based approaches, such as tree planting, improved soil management and production of biochar (plant-derived charcoal). And just as with emissions-avoidance projects, studies reveal persistent integrity failings, particularly regarding the crediting of non-existent and non-additional removals9,10. Bad offsets cheat the climate by failing to deliver their promised emission reductions. And they do further damage by distorting carbon-pricing schemes. Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them In a well-functioning emissions trading scheme, the carbon price will reflect the marginal cost of reducing emissions, whether at a polluting facility or through an offset project. When offsets lack integrity, credit prices reflect the cost of supplying pretend, rather than real, emission reductions, which artificially lowers the carbon price. The same is true for carbon taxes: low-integrity credits reduce the carbon price faced by polluters by allowing them to surrender cheap credits in place of paying the tax. or

October 13, 2025 19:39 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced it will start shipping NVIDIA DGX Spark™, the world’s smallest AI supercomputer. AI workloads are quickly outgrowing the memory and software capabilities of the PCs, workstations and laptops millions of developers rely on today — forcing teams to shift work to the cloud or local data centers. As a new class of computer, DGX Spark delivers a petaflop of AI performance and 128GB of unified memory in a compact desktop form factor, giving developers the power to run inference on AI models with up to 200 billion parameters and fine-tune models of up to 70 billion parameters locally. In addition, DGX Spark lets developers create AI agents and run advanced software stacks locally. “In 2016, we built DGX-1 to give AI researchers their own supercomputer. I hand-delivered the first system to Elon at a small startup called OpenAI — and from it came ChatGPT, kickstarting the AI revolution,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “DGX-1 launched the era of AI supercomputers and unlocked the scaling laws that drive modern AI. With DGX Spark, we return to that mission — placing an AI computer in the hands of every developer to ignite the next wave of breakthroughs.” DGX Spark brings together the full NVIDIA AI platform — including GPUs, CPUs, networking, CUDA® libraries and the NVIDIA AI software stack — into a system small enough for a lab or an office, yet powerful enough to accelerate agentic and physical AI development. By combining breakthrough performance with the reach of the NVIDIA ecosystem, DGX Spark transforms the desktop into an AI development platform. DGX Spark systems deliver up to 1 petaflop of AI performance, accelerated by a NVIDIA GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, NVIDIA ConnectX®-7 200 Gb/s networking and NVIDIA NVLink™-C2C technology, providing 5x the bandwidth of fifth-generation PCIe with 128GB of CPU-GPU coherent memory. The NVIDIA AI software stack is preinstalled to enable developers to start working on AI projects out of the box. With DGX Spark, developers can access NVIDIA AI ecosystem tools including models, libraries, and NVIDIA NIM™ microservices, enabling local workflows such as customizing Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.1 models to refine image generation, creating a vision search and summarization agent using the NVIDIA Cosmos™ Reason vision language model, or building an AI chatbot using Qwen3 that is optimized for DGX Spark. To celebrate DGX Spark shipping worldwide, Huang hand-delivered one of the first units of DGX Spark to Elon Musk, chief engineer at SpaceX, today in Starbase, Texas. The exchange was a connection to the supercomputer’s origins, as Musk was among the team that received the first NVIDIA DGX™-1 supercomputer from Huang in 2016. Other early recipients of DGX Spark, including Anaconda, Cadence, ComfyUI, Docker, Google, Hugging Face, JetBrains, LM Studio, Meta, Microsoft, Ollama and Roboflow, are testing, validating and optimizing their tools, software and models for DGX Spark. Research organizations around the world, including the NYU Global Frontier Lab, previewed DGX Spark to boost their AI development. “DGX Spark allows us to access peta-scale computing on our desktop,” said Kyunghyun Cho, professor of computer and data science at the NYU Global Frontier Lab. “This new way to conduct AI research and development enables us to rapidly prototype and experiment with advanced AI algorithms and models — even for privacy- and security-sensitive applications, such as healthcare.” NVIDIA DGX Spark Now Shipping Starting Wednesday, Oct. 15, DGX Spark can be ordered on NVIDIA.com. Partner systems will be available from Acer, ASUS, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, HP, Lenovo, MSI as well as Micro Center stores in the U.S., and from NVIDIA channel partners worldwide.

UPDATED 19:15 EDT / OCTOBER 13 2025 by Maria Deutscher JPMorgan Chase & Co. today announced plans to invest up to $10 billion in technology and infrastructure companies. The news sent several quantum computer makers’ shares soaring more than 20%. JPMorgan will invest mainly in U.S. companies with the goal of supporting their engineering and manufacturing operations. The bank will make the investments as part of a new program, the Security and Resiliency Initiative, through which it plans to support “industries critical to national economic security and resiliency.” In addition to investing its own capital, the bank will provide participating companies with $1.5 trillion worth of financing over 10 years, 50% more than what it had planned to offer before. The Security and Resiliency Initiative will focus on 27 different areas that the bank has organized into four categories. The first category, which JPMorgan calls frontier and strategic technologies, includes five technology verticals including quantum computing. Shares of quantum computer developers D-Wave Quantum Inc. and IonQ Inc. rose more than 20% on the news, while Quantum Computing Inc. closed 12% higher. It’s possible JPMorgan’s interest in the quantum technology market isn’t limited solely to computers. The bank listed sensor hardware as a focus of its new investment initiative. Many of the most advanced sensors in development today use quantum mechanical phenomena, such as the behavior of low-temperature atoms, to detect environmental changes. IonQ, one of the quantum computer makers that logged stock price gains today, entered the quantum sensor market earlier this year. Alongside its frontier and strategic technologies category, JPMorgan plans to invest in three other areas. They include supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace and energy independence and resilience. Those categories also include technology-related subfields. JPMorgan’s supply chain and advanced manufacturing investment plan, for example, will partly focus on companies developing autonomous mobile robots. The bank will also seek to back chipmaking equipment providers. In the energy sector, battery storage is among the technologies that JPMorgan lists as a priority. The Wall Street heavyweight will hire bankers, investment professionals and other experts to support its new financing initiative. It will also appoint an external advisory council to help guide the program. “Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America’s economy,” said JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. “America needs more speed and investment.” Another major financial institution, The Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is also sharpening its focus on the tech sector. The investment bank today announced plans to acquire San Francisco-based venture capital firm Industry Ventures for $665 million in cash and equity. Goldman Sachs will pay an additional $300 million through 2030 if certain performance goals are met. Industry Ventures has 45 staffers who manage $7 billion worth of assets. The firm has backed Meta Platforms Inc., Uber Technologies Inc. and other major consumer tech firms over the past 25 years. Its portfolio also includes enterprise software companies such as Datadog Inc., a publicly traded observability provider.

Semiconductor stocks gained ground Monday as China tariff concerns dissipated, while one chipmaker got a boost from a major artificial intelligence partnership announcement. Shares of casino operators fell as stormy weather dragged on gaming revenue in a key region. Major U.S. equities indexes bounced back as President Donald Trump adopted a softer stance on trade relations with China and officials said the leaders of the two countries are still on track for an upcoming meeting. The S&P 500 jumped 1.6%. The Dow was up 1.3%, closing a bit above 46000, while the Nasdaq added 2.2%. For more Investopedia coverage of the day's major market stories, read here. Broadcom (AVGO) shares surged 9.9% after the chipmaker said it would collaborate with ChatGPT maker OpenAI on the development of artificial intelligence accelerator and network systems. The unveiling of Broadcom's partnership with the world's most valuable startup came a week after Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced its own OpenAI deal. Nvidia (NVDA) said that its ethernet networking switches would be incorporated into AI data centers by (META) and Oracle (ORCL). The competitive threat from the AI chip behemoth weighed on shares of data center switch provider Arista Networks (ANET), which sank 4.3%. Nvidia's shares ended the day 2.9% higher. Other semiconductor stocks gained ground Monday as concerns subsided about a possible intensification of U.S.-China trade tensions. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) jumped 4.9%, clawing back losses posted last week. Among the strongest performers were shares of ON Semiconductor (ON) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), which gained 9.6% and 8.5%, respectively. A lower percieved likelihood of increased tariffs on goods from China also helped drive a recovery in shares of companies that import a major portion of their products from the world's second-largest economy. Shares of electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) bounced about 10% Monday. Fastenal (FAST) shares fell 7.5%, the most of any S&P 500 stock, after the provider of industrial construction supplies missed expectations with its third-quarter earnings per share. An uptick in selling, general, and administrative costs weighed on profitability. The company said sluggish industrial production affected its performance but highlighted strength in its fastener product line. Casino operators came under pressure after a report revealed that September gross gaming revenue in Macau fell more than expected. The underperformance of the Asian gambling hotspot reflects a disruption caused by Super Typhoon Ragasa. Storm-related impacts to the region continued in early October, as Typhoon Matmo also resulting in closures and travel cancelations. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) shares were down 6.3%, while Wynn Resorts (WYNN) stock lost 6.2%.

Title: Is the AI Conveyor Belt of Capital About to Stop?

reading time 8 minutes The American economy is little more than a big bet on AI. Morgan Stanley investor Ruchir Sharma recently noted that money poured into AI investments now accounts for about 40% of the United Statesâ GDP growth in 2025, and AI companies are responsible for 80% of growth in American stocks. So how bad is it that the most recent major deal among AI giants, agreements that have driven up stock prices dramatically, look like a snake eating its own tail? In recent months, Nvidia announced that it would invest $100 billion into OpenAI, OpenAI announced that it would pay $300 billion to Oracle for computing power, and Oracle announced it would buy $40 billion worth of chips from Nvidia. It doesnât take a flow chart to get the feeling that these firms are just moving money around between each other. But surely thatâs not happeningâ¦right? Itâs a little harder to get assurances of that than you might think.Â Many of these agreements are, on their face, mutually beneficial. If everything is on the level, while these deals might be circular, they should be moving everything forward. Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told Gizmodo that deals like these could result in a âless capacity-constrained world,â which would allow for faster development of models that could produce higher returns on investment. âThe better models we have, the more we can realize a lot of these AI use cases that are on hold just because the technology isnât powerful enough yet to handle it,â he said. âIf that happens, and that can generate real [return on investment] for customers â¦ that results in real cost savings, potentially new revenue generation opportunities, and that creates net benefits from a GDP perspective.â So as long as we keep having AI breakthroughs and these companies figure out how to monetize their products, everything should be fine. On the off chance that doesnât happen, though?Â âIf that doesn’t happen, if there is no real enterprise AI adoption, then it’s all round-tripping,â Jaluria said. Round-tripping, generally speaking, refers to the unethical and typically illegal practice of making trades or transactions to artificially prop up a particular asset or company, making it look like itâs more valuable and in demand than it actually is. In this case, it would be tech companies that are trying to make it appear like they are more valuable than they actually are by announcing big deals with each other that move the stock price.Â So what might suggest whether this money is actually accomplishing anything other than serving as hot air in a rapidly inflating bubble? Jaluria said heâs watching for faster developments of models, advancements in performance, and overall AI adoption. âIf this leads to a step function change in the way enterprise is adopting and utilizing AI, that creates a benefit,â he said. Whether that is happening currently or not is kind of in the eye of the beholder. OpenAI has certainly shown advancements in its technology. The release of its Sora 2 video generation model has unleashed a fresh hell upon the world, used to generate significant amounts of copyright violations and misinformation. But the latest version of the companyâs flagship model, GPT-5, underwhelmed and failed to live up to expectations when it was released in August.Â Adoption rates of the technology are also a bit of a Rorschach test. The company boasts that 10% of the world is using ChatGPT, and nearly 80% of the business world says that itâs looking into how to utilize the technology. But the early adopters arenât finding much utility. According to a survey from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 95% of companies that have tried to integrate generative AI tools into their operations have produced zero return on investment. Where these investments are generating a return is in the stock market. Which, frankly, does not quell concerns about these firms simply boosting one anotherâs bottom line. Take Oracle, for example. Last month, the cloud provider had aÂ rough quarter by all traditional indicators. It missed on both its revenue and earnings projections, and its net income was flat year-over-year. And yet, the stock price soared. The reason: the company’s plump list of remaining performance obligationsâfinancial agreements that will provide revenue that have not yet been fulfilled. There, the company showed a massive amount of growth, a 359% increase from the year prior, with a projected $455 billion coming in.Â That money is not real yet. Nor is the growth the company has promised, claiming that its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue would grow from under $20 billion to nearly $150 billion before the start of the 2030s. But all of it was sufficient for investors to drive up Oracle’s share price enough to slingshot CEO Larry Ellison into the top spot on the world’s richest person list, briefly leapfrogging Elon Musk.Â Most of this promised revenue will come from OpenAI, which made a commitment to purchase $300 billion worth of computing power from the company over five years. The clock on that contract doesn’t start until 2027, but assuming it actually happens, it would be one of the largest cloud computing deals in history. It’s also one of the most unlikely, just based on where the companies involved currently stand. In order to provide the compute that it has promised to OpenAI, Oracle will reportedly need to generate 4.5 gigawatts of power capacity, more than two Hoover Dams’ worth of power. On the other side of the deal, OpenAI will have to pay about $60 billion per year to fit the bill for the agreement. It currently generates about $10 billion in revenue, which, statistically speaking, is less than $60 billion. You can see a similar circular shape to OpenAIâs recent deal with Nvidia rival AMD, too. The exact details of the agreement werenât reported, but chipmaker AMD expects to generate tens of billions of dollars over the next half-decade as it sells its AI chips to OpenAI. As part of the agreement, OpenAI gets a swath of shares in AMD, with options to buy up to 10% of the company. Lucky for OpenAI, thereâs really no better time to get your hands on some AMD shares than right before it announces a big AI-related deal. The companyâs stock price surged by about 35% following the announcement.Â With those two most recent deals on the books, OpenAI has agreed to more than $1 trillion worth of computing deals so far this year. Thatâs a lot for any company to spend, but itâs especially a lot for a still-private company that reports just $10 billion in projected revenue through 2025. Even by its most recent funding rounds, the company as a whole is currently valued at about $500 billion. Most of those deals have contingencies attached. For instance, Nvidiaâs investment in OpenAI isnât actually $100 billion, but an initial $10 billion for one gigawatt of data center capacity with the potential for $100 billion if 10 gigawatts are ultimately achieved. But the stock prices and valuations certainly seem to treat these deals as if they are set in stone. And OpenAI seems to be operating that way, too. The company claims that itâll more than 10x its revenue in the next few years, and projects itâll hit $129 billion annually by 2029. That type of potentially inflated revenue figure is the kind of thing that makes some people think of the Dot Com bubble of the early 2000s, where we saw companies like Commerce One receive a $21 billion valuation despite barely having any revenue. But Peter Atwater, Adjunct Professor of Economics at William and Mary and President of consulting firm Financial Insyghts, sees a different reflection in the AI bubble: the housing market collapse.Â âWhat we saw at the top of the mortgage market was all of these conveyor belts of capital, money flowing from one party to another party to another party. And what you started to see was that there were multiple points of relationship so that any participant in the system was then dependent on every other conveyor belt in the system working simultaneously to keep the system going,â he told Gizmodo. âIn many ways, we’re seeing the same developing web of capital flows across the AI space.â This creates some obvious problems. The circular deals that, in theory, are wheels moving the whole thing forward all have to keep turning. If any of them stop, the whole thing stops, because they are all so interconnected that no failure is truly isolated.Â Atwater said that the types of major, metric-contingent deals that have been dominating headlines in the AI space arenât all that different from some of what was happening in the mortgage industry back in 2007, where some of the financial commitments required mortgages to meet certain conditions. âIn the frenzy of a bubble, everyone overcommits. The purpose of overcommitting is to stake a claim in what you believe will be an intensely scarce commodity in the future. So you have buyers overcommit and you have sellers agreeing to overprovide as a result,â he explained. âWhat we find over and over is that commitments are among the first obligations to be cut off once conditions change, once confidence begins to fall.â Right now, thereâs a stomach for those commitments. That isnât guaranteed to be there in the future if all of these promised returns on investment donât materialize. Atwater said that the market requires credit markets being willing to continue to extend massive sums of money to cover the agreements made, equity markets that value these transactions at âan extraordinary multiple,â and suppliers capable of delivering the promised products. Thereâs no guarantee that all of those factors will hold.Â The math is already pretty tricky. As tech commentator Ed Zitron has pointed out, major firms like Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, Amazon, and Google have invested about $560 billion in AI infrastructure over the last two years. Theyâve brought in a combined $35 billion in AI-related revenue. OpenAIâs commitments are even bigger, with returns that are arguably even smaller.Â The companyâs development and expansion of its services will rely in no small part on massive data center projects, which will require the same amount of energy to operate as New York City and San Diego combinedâenergy that currently isnât even available. And, once again, there is no guarantee that the end product, once all of that energy is spent and data centers are built, will actually generate revenue. âUltimately, if you do not have a consumer for the product, there will be no AI space because these companies can’t continue to do this for nothing. Listening to a lot of the calls in the last couple of weeks, there’s a clear open question as to how these companies are going to make money at this,â Atwater said. For the moment, everyone is seeing green, and hope springs eternal. As long as that is the case, no one will ask where the revenue is coming from. âRight now, the AI sector is operating in a forever mindset. They are acting as if they have a very long period of time under which they can figure this out and make money,â Atwater said. âAs long as confidence is high, this entire ecosystem can offer fantasy. When confidence falls, they’re going to be expected to deliver real-term performance in a very short time frame.â Unfortunately, should that happen, it wonât just be these companies that bear the brunt of the failure. âYou have to look at this as a larger ecosystem. To talk about AI today, it means we have to talk about the credit market, we have to talk about the credit market. Wall Street and AI are a single beast,â Atwater said, warning that a very small number of firms currently have a major grasp on the whole of the American economy.Â Lots of investors are piling into the AI space, fearful of missing out on a market that seems like it can only go up. But few of them are looking at why those valuations and stock prices keep climbing, showing little curiosity as to what might happen if all of this money is just getting shifted around, artificially inflating the actual value of the companies they are betting on.Â ââWhy?â,â Atwater said, “is the last question asked in a bull market.” Explore more on these topics Share this story Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

Crypto mining stocks tied to the red-hot artificial intelligence (AI) data center trade were the fastest horses on Monday to recover from Friday's market rout. Bitfarms (BITF) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) surged 26% and 20% respectively on Monday, while Bitdeer (BTDR), IREN (IREN) and MARA Holdings (MARA) advanced around 10%. The rally reflects optimism that booming AI compute demand will help miners. Perhaps boosting sentiment was ChatGPT creator OpenAI striking a deal with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) to build up custom chips for AI and machine learning. Also on Monday, Bloom Energy (BE) announced a $5 billion deal with Brookfield Asset Management to deploy fuel cells in data centers to satisfy AI's voracious energy demand. The gains occurred after Friday's steep downturn as trade tensions between the U.S. and China ratcheted up, with Trump imposing a 100% increase in tariffs on Chinese goods to retaliate against tightening rare earth metals export controls. Investor concerns eased somewhat over the weekend, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes were up 2.1% and 1.4% on Monday. Other crypto related names enjoyed modest gains. Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest bitcoin treasury firm, climbed 2.8%, while crypto exchange Coinbase was roughly flat. Digital brokerage Robinhood, which earns a large portion of its revenue from crypto trading, was up 1%. Ethereum ETH$3,907.99 treasury firm BitMine (BMNR), meanwhile, bounced almost 7% as the firm said to capitalize on the crypto plunge of the past few days, purchasing over 200,000 tokens worth over $840 million at current prices.

Title: The A.I. Boom and the Spectre of 1929
URL: https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-ai-boom-and-the-spectre-of-1929
Time Published: 2025-10-13T19:08:24Z
Full Content:
As stocks plummeted on the morning of October 24th, 1929, a large crowd gathered on Wall Street outside of the New York Stock Exchange. Pat Bologna, a local shoeshiner whose life savings were invested in the market, dodged into a packed brokerage nearby. “Everybody is shouting,” he later recalled. “They’re all trying to reach the glass booth where the clerks are. Everybody wants to sell out. The boy at the quotation board is running scared. He can’t keep up with the speed of the way stocks are dropping. The board’s painted green. The guy who runs it is Irish. He’s standing at the back of the booth, on the telephone. I can’t hear what he’s saying. But a guy near me shouts, ‘the sonofabitch has sold me out!’ ” The stock-market crash of 1929 occupies a dark but indelible place in the national imagination, and for good reason. In the age of online trading and algorithmic traders, the next stock crash, whenever it comes, will be a largely digital phenomenon. But its consequences will certainly play out in the analog world: wealth destruction, human anguish, fallout in the rest of the economy. On Wall Street, as the speculative A.I. boom continues to grow, even some financial titans are acknowledging that it might not end well. “There will be a check at some point, there will be a drawdown,” David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said at a recent conference. Last week, Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, told the BBC that he was “far more worried” than others about the possibility of a big fall in the market. A few days later, when Donald Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on China, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dived nine hundred points, only to rebound on Monday after Trump softened his rhetoric. Perhaps the most alarming feature of the 1929 crash was that it wasn’t a one-off. After peaking in September, 1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average entered a downward trend that lasted nearly three years; by July of 1932, it had sunk by about ninety per cent. The crash’s giddy prequel, dramatic unfolding, and shattering aftermath—the Great Depression—has long provided compelling material for writers. In 1931, Frederick Lewis Allen, of Harper’s Magazine, described in his book “Only Yesterday” the speculative frenzy that preceded the crash: “Stories of fortunes made overnight were on everybody’s lips. . . . Wives were asking their husbands why they were so slow, why they weren’t getting in on all this, only to hear that their husbands had bought a hundred shares of American Linseed that very morning.” Almost a quarter century later, John Kenneth Galbraith brought an economist’s eye and a dry wit to the subject with “The Great Crash 1929.” The book detailed how, in the summer of that year, when stock prices were already sky-high, the Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation, in partnership with the utility baron Harrison Williams, launched two huge investment trusts, the Shenandoah Corporation and the Blue Ridge Corporation, which employed leverage—that is, borrowed money—and a pyramid structure to magnify investors’ gains (or, as it turned out, their losses). “If there must be madness something may be said for having it on a heroic scale,” Galbraith wrote. In 1979, the fiftieth anniversary of the crash, the co-authors Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan-Witts published “The Day the Bubble Burst,” which included the anecdote about the shoeshiner. Now, four years before the hundredth anniversary, comes “1929,” a new book by Andrew Ross Sorkin, a financial columnist for the Times and a co-anchor on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” As in Sorkin’s previous book, “Too Big to Fail,” a best-selling account of the financial crisis of 2008, he focusses mainly on the financiers and policymakers at the center of the crisis, drawing on private letters, transcripts, oral histories, architectural plans, memoirs, newspaper accounts, corporate filings, and prior histories. His narrative extends from February of 1929 to well beyond the crash, to the failed efforts of Herbert Hoover to revive a stricken economy; the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt; the U.S. Senate’s famous Pecora Commission, which exposed a great deal of Wall Street self-dealing; and the passage of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which curbed some of the Street’s excesses by separating commercial banking (making loans and taking deposits) from investment banking (selling and dealing in securities). Other reforms introduced under Roosevelt included the founding of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had a mandate to protect investors and maintain fair and orderly markets, and the federal insurance of bank deposits, which ended a calamitous wave of bank runs. In historical terms, the 1929 crash and the election of F.D.R. marked the dividing line between the untrammelled financial capitalism that had emerged during the Gilded Age in the late nineteenth century, and the managed capitalism of the mid-twentieth century. For several decades, this system delivered strong economic growth and a more equal income distribution, until inflation upended it and ushered in the neoliberal era of financial deregulation. (In 1999, Bill Clinton signed into law the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed key parts of Glass-Steagall.) During the nineteen-twenties, Sorkin writes, “Wall Street became like a giant balloon floating above the common people, its self-mythologizing leaders enjoying the comforts of what felt like a privileged realm.” His leading characters include Charles Mitchell, the chairman of National City Bank, a predecessor of Citibank, who, in March of 1929, resisted efforts by the Federal Reserve to restrict bank lending to speculators in the market; Thomas Lamont, a senior partner at J. P. Morgan & Co., who, during the panic selling on October 24th, organized a futile effort to stabilize the market; and Jesse Livermore, a storied speculator who made and lost several fortunes before eventually shooting himself in the cloakroom of the Sherry-Netherland hotel. There are cameos by everyone from Al Smith and William Randolph Hearst to Winston Churchill and Groucho Marx, both of whom speculated heavily in the market and paid the price. No two speculative booms are exactly alike, of course, but they share some common elements. Typically, there is great excitement among investors about new technology—in today’s case, A.I.—and its potential to boost profits for companies positioned to take advantage of it. In the twenties, commercial radio was a novel and revolutionary medium: tens of millions of Americans tuned in. Sorkin points out that, between 1921 and 1928, stock in Radio Corporation of America, the Nvidia of its day, went from $1 ½ to $85 ½. Another hallmark of a stock bubble is that, at some point, its participants largely give up on conventional valuation measures and buy in simply because prices are rising and everybody else is doing it: FOMO rules the day. By some metrics, valuations were even higher during the late-nineteen-nineties internet stock bubble than they were in the late twenties. And according to the latest report from the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee, which was released last week, valuations in the U.S. market are, by one measure, “comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble.” That’s true according to the cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which tracks stock prices relative to corporate earnings averaged over the previous ten years. If, instead of looking back, you focus on predictions of future earnings, valuations are less stretched: the Bank of England report noted that they remain “below the levels reached during the dot-com bubble.” But that’s just another way of saying that investors are betting on earnings growing rapidly in the coming years. And this is a moment when many companies have so far seen precious little return for their A.I. investments. To be sure, not everyone agrees that stock prices have departed from reality. In a note to clients last week, analysts at Goldman Sachs said the market’s rise, which is heavily concentrated in Big Tech stocks, “has, so far, been driven by fundamental growth rather than irrational speculation.” Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, whose chips power A.I. systems at companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta, said that he believed the world was at “the beginning of a new industrial revolution.” However, even the authors of the Goldman report acknowledged that there are elements of the current situation “that rhyme with previous bubbles,” including the big gains in stock prices and the emergence of questionable financing schemes. Last month, Nvidia announced it would invest up to one hundred billion dollars over the next decade in OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT, which is already a big purchaser of Nvidia’s chips and will likely need more to power its expansion. Nvidia has said OpenAI isn’t obligated to spend the money it invests on Nvidia chips, but the deal, and others like it, have sparked comparisons to the dot-com bubble, when some big tech companies engaged in so-called “circular” transactions that ultimately didn’t work out. Another recurring feature of the biggest asset booms is outright chicanery, such as fraudulent accounting, the marketing of worthless securities, and plain old stealing. Galbraith referred to this phenomenon as “the bezzle.” In hard times, he noted, creditors are tight-fisted and audits are scrupulous: as a result, “commercial morality is enormously improved.” In boom times, creditors are more trusting, lending standards get debased, and borrowed money is plentiful. But there “are always many people who need more,” Galbraith explained, and “the bezzle increases rapidly,” as it did in the late twenties. “Just as the boom accelerated the rate of growth,” he went on, “so the crash enormously advanced the rate of discovery.” Sorkin traces the fates of Albert Wiggin and Richard Whitney, who, at the time of the crash were, respectively, the C.E.O. of Chase National Bank and the vice-president of the New York Stock Exchange. Both men were involved in the failed effort, orchestrated by Lamont, to stabilize the market. In 1932, Wiggin went on to become a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But, during the Pecora investigation, which began that same year, it emerged that, beginning in September of 1929, Wiggin had secretly shorted the stock of his own bank, using a pair of companies he owned to make the trades. He was forced to resign from the Fed. In 1930, Whitney, the scion of a prominent New England family, became the president of the stock exchange, but he was ultimately exposed as an embezzler and served more than three years in Sing Sing. On being reminded of stories like these, it’s tempting to cast the leaders of nineteen-twenties Wall Street as a bunch of crooks. Sorkin resists the impulse. In an afterword, he writes, “The difficulty is that, other than the disgraced Richard Whitney and Albert Wiggin, it is hard to make the case that any of the era’s other major financial figures did anything appreciably worse than most individuals would have done in their positions and circumstances.” Given the role that Wall Street’s élite played in inflating and promoting the bubble, this is either a generous view or a jaded commentary on the fallen nature of mankind. In any case, though, it’s true that speculative booms tend to take on a life of their own, creating incentives and opportunities that warp people’s judgment at all levels of the economy, from small investors and professional intermediaries to major corporate and financial institutions. One aspect of the current boom that hasn’t received sufficient attention is how it has extended from the stock market to the credit markets, where there has been enormous growth in so-called “private lending” by non-bank institutions, including private-equity companies, hedge funds, and specialized credit firms. Last week, news organizations reported that the Department of Justice had opened an investigation into the collapse of First Brands, an acquisitive Cleveland-based auto-parts firm that, with Wall Street’s help, had apparently raised billions of dollars in opaque transactions. One creditor told a bankruptcy court that up to $2.3 billion in collateral had “simply vanished,” and called for the appointment of an independent examiner. A lawyer for First Brands said the company denied any wrongdoing and attributed the collapse to “macroeconomic factors” beyond its control. The sudden demise of a single highly leveraged company that operated in a sector far from the A.I. frontier may be a one-off event, with no broader implications. Or it could conceivably be a harbinger of what lies ahead. We won’t know for a while—perhaps a good while. But in the words of the nineteenth-century English journalist Walter Bagehot, whom Galbraith quoted, “every great crisis reveals the excessive speculations of many houses which no one before suspected.” This time is unlikely to be different. ♦

Title: OpenAI-Broadcom agreement sends shares of chipmaker soaring
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/13/openai-broadcom-chipmaker-artificial-intelligence-data-center/
Time Published: 2025-10-13T16:08:52Z
Full Content:
Broadcom Inc. shares jumped after OpenAI agreed to buy the company’s custom chips and networking equipment in a multiyear deal, part of an ambitious plan by the startup to add artificial intelligence infrastructure. In a pact announced Monday, OpenAI agreed to buy custom chips and networking components from Broadcom to help power its artificial intelligence services. OpenAI had already struck deals for data centers and chips that easily top $1 trillion, and the company plans to spend tens of billions of dollars more on Broadcom chips, according to people familiar with the matter. By customizing the processors, OpenAI said it will be able to embed what it has learned from developing AI models and services “directly into the hardware, unlocking new levels of capability and intelligence.” The hardware rollout should be completed by the end of 2029, according to the companies. For Broadcom, the move provides deeper access to the booming AI market. Monday’s agreement confirms an arrangement that Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan had hinted at during an earnings conference call last month. Investors sent Broadcom shares up as as much as 11% on Monday, betting that the OpenAI alliance will generate hundreds of billions of dollars in new revenue for the chipmaker. But the details of how OpenAI will pay for the equipment aren’t spelled out. While the AI startup has shown it can easily raise funding from investors, it’s burning through wads of cash and doesn’t expect to be cash-flow positive until around the end of this decade. OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has inked a number of blockbuster deals this year, aiming to ease constraints on computing power. Nvidia Corp., whose chips handle the majority of AI work, said last month that it will invest as much as $100 billion in OpenAI to support new infrastructure — with a goal of at least 10 GW of capacity. And just last week, OpenAI announced a pact to deploy 6 GW of Advanced Micro Device Inc. processors over multiple years. As AI and cloud companies announce large projects every few days, it’s often not clear how the efforts are being financed. The interlocking deals also have boosted fears of a bubble in AI spending, particularly as many of these partnerships involve OpenAI, a fast-growing but unprofitable business. While purchasing chips from others, OpenAI has also been working on designing its own semiconductors. They’re mainly intended to handle the inference stage of running AI models — the phase after the technology is trained. There’s no investment or stock component to the Broadcom deal, OpenAI said, making it different than the agreements with Nvidia and AMD. An OpenAI spokesperson declined to comment on how the company will finance the chips, but the underlying idea is that more computing power will let the company sell more services. A single gigawatt of AI computing capacity today costs roughly $35 billion for the chips alone, with 10 GW totaling upwards of $350 billion. But a chief reason OpenAI is working to develop its own chip is to bring down its costs, and it’s unclear what price Broadcom’s chips will command under the deal. OpenAI might be trying to emulate Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which made its own chips using Broadcom’s technology and saw lower costs compared with other AI companies, such as Meta Platforms Inc., according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh. Google’s success with Broadcom might have steered OpenAI to that chipmaker, rather than suppliers such as Marvell Technology Inc., Singh added. In announcing the agreement, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that his company has been working with Broadcom for 18 months. The startup is rethinking technology starting with the transistors and going all the way up to what happens when someone asks ChatGPT a question, he said on a podcast released by his company. “By being able to optimize across that entire stack, we can get huge efficiency gains, and that will lead to much better performance, faster models, cheaper models.” When Tan referred to the agreement last month, he didn’t name the customer, though people familiar with the matter identified it as OpenAI. “If you do your own chips, you control your destiny,” Tan said in the podcast Monday. Broadcom has increasingly been seen as a key beneficiary of AI spending, helping propel its share price this year. The stock was up 40% so far this year through Friday’s close, outpacing a 29% gain by the benchmark Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. OpenAI, meanwhile, has garnered a $500 billion valuation, making it the world’s biggest startup by that measure. By tapping Broadcom’s networking technology, OpenAI is hedging its bets. Broadcom’s Ethernet-based options compete with Nvidia’s proprietary technology. OpenAI also will be designing its own gear as part of its work on custom hardware, the startup said. Broadcom won’t be providing the data center capacity itself. Instead, it will deploy server racks with custom hardware to facilities run by either OpenAI or its cloud-computing partners. A single gigawatt is about the capacity of a conventional nuclear power plant. Still, 10 GW of computing power alone isn’t enough to support OpenAI’s vision of achieving artificial general intelligence, said OpenAI co-founder and President Greg Brockman. “That is a drop in the bucket compared to where we need to go,” he said. Getting to the level under discussion isn’t going to happen quickly, said Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s semiconductor solutions group. “Take railroads — it took about a century to roll it out as critical infrastructure. If you take the internet, it took about 30 years,” he said. “This is not going to take five years.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: It's Broadcom's Turn to Get a Stock Bump From Some OpenAI News

OpenAI isn't publicly traded. But when it acts, stocks often move. On Monday, it was Broadcom's (AVGO) turn. Shares of the chipmaker were recently up nearly 10%, approaching 2025 highs, following an announcement that the ChatGPT maker would team with the chipmaker to co-develop AI systems for delivery from 2026 to 2029. Today's climb in Broadcom shares is another example of the sustained popularity of the news-driven AI trade, which continues amid concerns about whether there's a bubble in the sector. It also highlights the power of OpenAI, considered the world's most valuable startup at about half a trillion dollars. One way for a stock to get a lift these days: land a mention in a press release or news report involving OpenAI, the company known for ChatGPT. Shares of Broadcom jumped Monday on just such an announcement, the latest to involve a major tech company. The deal is "a pivotal moment in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence," Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement. OpenAI chief Sam Altman called it "a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI’s potential." The Broadcom news follows a raft of other OpenAI announcements in recent weeks. News about a partnership with AMD (AMD) powered that chip maker's shares higher in early October. And Nvidia's (NVDA) stock rose last month after it announced plans to invest as much as $100 billion in OpenAI. (September reports also highlighted a multiyear Oracle (ORCL)-OpenAI deal worth hundreds of billions of dollars.) And when OpenAI had a "DevDay" event earlier this month, shares of a range of companies that were mentioned—including Figma (FIG) and Expedia (EXPE)—also got lifts. As for Broadcom specifically, its shares recently changed hands at about $356, roughly 9% off the Visible Alpha mean of Wall Street analysts near $389. The stock has gained 54% since the start of 2025.

Title: Holiday hiring forecast to fall to 16-year low as tariffs force retail pullback
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/13/tariffs-trump-holiday-hiring-shopping-inflation-shrinks-retailers/
Time Published: 2025-10-13T15:12:46Z

Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs is forcing retailers to pull back or delay plans to hire seasonal workers who pack orders at distribution centers, serve shoppers at stores and build holiday displays during the most important selling season of the year. American Christmas LLC, which creates elaborate holiday installations for commercial properties such as New York’s Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall, plans to hire 220 temporary workers and is ramping up recruitment nearly two months later than usual, CEO Dan Casterella said. Last year, the company took on 300 people during its busy period. The main reason? The company wants to offset its tariff bill, which Casterella expects to be as big as $1.5 million this year, more than double last year’s $600,000. “The issue is if you overstaff and then you underperform, it’s too late,” Casterella said. ”I think everyone’s more mindful now than ever. ” Job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas forecasts hiring for the last three months of the year will likely fall under 500,000 positions. That’s fewer than last year’s 543,000 level and also marks the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years when retailers hired 495,800 temporary workers, the firm said. The average seasonal gain since 2005 has been 653,363 workers, the firm said. Among other companies cutting holiday payrolls: Radial, which powers deliveries for roughly 120 brands like Lands’ End and Cole Haan and operates 20 fulfillment sites. It plans to hire 6,500 workers, fewer than last year’s 7,000, and is waiting to the last minute to ramp up hiring for some of its clients, chief human resources officer Sabrina Wnorowski, said. Bath & Body Works, based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, said it plans to hire 32,000 workers, lower than the 32,700 a year ago. Among the bright spots: Online behemoth Amazon Inc. said Monday it intends to hire 250,000 full-, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, the same level as a year ago. “We saw real strong signals that there’s been a cooling in the labor market, even beyond what our expectations were in the first nine months of the year,” Challenger’s senior vice president Andy Challenger said. “We are having lots of regular conversations with companies about pending layoffs and changes they’re making to their workforce.” In addition to overall economic uncertainty, Challenger noted companies are using artificial intelligence bots to replace some workers, particularly those working in call centers. And he’s also seeing companies hiring workers closer to when they need them. Meanwhile, the list of companies staying mum about their specific holiday hiring goals keeps growing. Target Corp., UPS and Macy’s are declining to offer figures, a departure from the past. UPS had hired 125,000 seasonal hires last year, while Target announced last year it planned to hire 100,000 workers. Macy’s last year said it would hire 31,500 seasonal workers. Retailers’ hiring plans mark the first clues to what’s in store for the U.S. holiday shopping season and come as the U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly because Trump’s trade wars have created uncertainty that’s paralyzing managers trying to make hiring decisions. The Labor Department reported in early September that U.S. employers — companies, government agencies and nonprofits — added just 22,000 jobs in August, down from 79,000 in July and well below the 80,000 that economists had expected. The government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and has delayed the release of economic reports, could worsen the job picture. In an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues, the White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started. The firings are happening as hundreds of thousands are already furloughed and still others are being required to report to duty without pay. Analysts will be closely monitoring the shutdown’s impact on spending. For now, many retailers say that consumers, while resilient, are choosy about what they buying. Analysts will also be closely watching how shoppers will react as retailers push through price increases as a result of high tariff costs in the next few months, experts said. Given an economic slowdown, holiday spending growth is expected to be smaller than a year ago, according to several forecasts. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase during the year-ago period. Deloitte Services LP forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31. That’s compared to the same year-ago period when retail sales increased 4.2% from the year before. Adobe expects U.S. online sales to hit $253.4 billion this holiday season from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, representing a 5.3% growth. That’s smaller than last year’s 8.7% growth. Given the uncertainty, companies increasingly want to hire workers closer to when they need them, experts said. “In today’s environment, brands are really looking for us to be agile,” Radial’s Wnorowski said. “Radial is meeting that need of the customer and the consumer with a more flexible and disciplined approach to hiring.” So for some of its clients, Radial will now be hiring two weeks before Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start for the holiday shopping season, instead of four weeks before the kickoff, she said. Radial is also speeding up training of holiday hires due to new technology that’s simplifying their tasks. It used to take a couple of days to train a worker, but now it only takes a couple of hours, she said. Meanwhile, Target said it’s again embracing a three-prong approach. It starts first by offering current workers additional hours and then taps into a separate pool of workers— 43,000— who pick up shifts that work for their schedules. The Minneapolis-based company also hires seasonal workers across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 distribution facilities to meet demand, it said. For the past few years, Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer and the largest private employer, has been offering the extra hours available during the holidays to its workers, a Walmart spokesperson said, noting it’s worked well and the feedback from customers and workers has been “overwhelmingly positive.” The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said there may be some seasonal hiring on a store-by-store basis, but the majority of stores will dole out those hours to current workers. Waiting until the last minute to hire workers could mean a mad scramble to find talent, but companies say that due to the slowing economy, they don’t anticipate having a hard time finding the needed pool. Meanwhile, the temporary halting of the release of economic reports leaves retailers in the dark about forecasting sales and the workers they need to meet the demand. “Certainly, for our customers not having access to data will put more of a challenge on their ability to forecast,” Wnorowski of Radial said. “But we’ll stay very close to them as we go into peak and we’ll adjust as soon we see things changing.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: JD Vance On Three Sunday Shows Is Three Times As Charming!

Time Published: 2025-10-13T14:31:26Z
Full Content:
JD Vance appeared on multiple Sunday shows this week. He was as charming, we mean off-putting and repellent, as ever. Let’s dive in! Beginning chronologically, Vance went on NBC to try his luck with Kristen Welker. If Vance was trying to prove he isn’t a sycophant, he failed almost immediately when he started by trying to chastise NBC News for not adequately praising King “MAGAbicho”: VANCE: But I also have to give your network a little bit of grief, Kristen, because last night I was watching NBC. They […] mentioned that during a rally last night in Israel, when Steve Witkoff, our great special envoy, mentioned Bibi Netanyahu the crowd booed. But the broadcast didn’t mention that when Steve Witkoff mentioned President Trump, the crowd actually cheered. And why is that, Kristen? Yes, and why didn’t the Nobel Committee make a one-time exception and give two Peace Prizes this year so Trump could have one? Waaah! (Netanyahu nominated Trump for a consolation prize today in Israel, don’t worry.) Subscribe! Later, the topic shifted to the GOP’s government shutdown, now hitting the two-week mark. Welker played a montage of Trump saying during the Obama years that it’s the president’s job to settle a shutdown. Confronted with a conflicting truth he can’t deny, again Vance opted for accidental honesty. VANCE: Well, Kristen, the president was talking back then when Barack Obama was president about the political realities. We are focused now on the governing realities because we’re in power. In other words, it was really easy to armchair quarterback how amazing a dealmaker he would have been when Obama was president, but now he’s in charge and finding out he sucks. Got it. Now that the GOP has given up on last week’s lie about “illegals getting healthcare” as their boogeyman during this shutdown, Vance has moved on to faux empathy for the people affected by it. VANCE: Well, I just think it shows the different priorities of Democrats and Republicans in the midst of these shutdowns. You really have to ask yourself, “Who do we care more about? Federal bureaucrats in Washington DC or low-income women getting the food benefits they deserve, our troops getting the payment they need, flood insurance across the Southeast in the midst of hurricane season?” Are you fucking serious right now? The GOP has cut $267 billion in SNAP benefits, plus further cuts in the Blowjobs For Billionaires Bill. The Education Department just wiped out the special education offices.Tthe Trump administration proposed FEMA making it harder to get federal disaster assistance ahead of hurricane season. Trump just gave a $20 billion bailout to Argentina’s libertarian government while they undercut American soybean farmers. And they’ve proposed stiffing furloughed federal workers on their backpay. GTFOH. Vance tried his luck with Margaret Brennan. Brennan pushed Vance on the self-inflicted chaos of the Trump Administration’s layoffs. BRENNAN: CBS did confirm on Saturday that the Trump administration went and rescinded some of the layoffs of hundreds of CDC scientists who were mistakenly laid off on Friday, and then told Saturday that’s not the case. But some of them were involved with the federal measles response. Some of them were involved with the response on Ebola. How does a mistake like this happen? Did the White House even talk to the CDC? VANCE: […] First of all, I want to assure the American people that the frontline health care workers, the people who monitor measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases, those people are still on the job […] But the second point, Margaret, is, the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos. […] BRENNAN: […] But that was a White House decision to lay off these individuals. As we frantically search for hazmat suits on Amazon, we certainly feel confident if another pandemic happens under these chucklefucks. Brennan asked about labor union legal challenges to these layoffs, and Vance’s central processing system began to deteriorate as he spat this out. VANCE: Of course, we always follow the law, and we always follow court cases. This is gibberish. Third time’s the charm? Nah! George Stephanopoulos asked Vance about Border Czar Tom Homan being caught on tape by the FBI accepting a $50,000 bribe. Vance refused to answer the question repeatedly, so Stephanopoulos ended the interview in the only manner appropriate: STEPHANOPOULOS: I didn’t insinuate anything. I asked you whether Tom Homan accepted $50,000, as was heard on an audio tape recorded by the FBI in September 2024. You did not answer the question. Thank you for your time. VANCE: No, George, I sai-- STEPHANOPOULOS: We’ll be right back. Stuffing these losers into metaphorical lockers is the only way to treat them. Have a week.

Title: OpenAI taps Broadcom to build its first AI processor
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1013/1538322-openai-taps-broadcom-to-build-its-first-ai-processor/
Time Published: 2025-10-13T14:06:19Z
Full Content:
OpenAI has partnered with Broadcom to produce its first in-house artificial intelligence processors, the latest chip tie-up for the ChatGPT maker as it races to secure the computing power needed to meet surging demand for its services. The companies said today that OpenAI would design the chips, which Broadcom will develop and deploy starting in the second half of 2026. They will roll out 10 gigawatts' worth of custom chips, whose power consumption is roughly equivalent to the needs of more than 8 million US households or five times the electricity produced by the Hoover Dam. The agreement is the latest in a string of massive AI chip investments that have highlighted the technology industry's surging appetite for computing power as it races to build systems that meet or surpass human intelligence. OpenAI last week unveiled a 6-gigawatt AI chip supply deal with AMD that includes an option to buy a stake in the chipmaker, days after disclosing that Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in the startup and provide it with data centre systems with at least 10 gigawatts of capacity. "Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI's potential," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the deal. The tie-up with Broadcom, first reported by Reuters last year, places OpenAI among cloud-computing giants such as Alphabet-owned Google and Amazon.com that are developing custom chips to meet surging AI demand and reduce dependence on Nvidia's costly processors that are limited in supply. The approach is not a sure bet. Similar efforts by Microsoft and Meta have run into delays or failed to match the performance of Nvidia chips, according to media reports, and analysts believe custom chips do not pose a threat to Nvidia's dominance in the short term. The rise of custom chips has, however, turned Broadcom - long known for its networking hardware - into one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, with its stock price rising nearly six-fold since the end of 2022. The company unveiled a blockbuster $10 billion custom AI chip order in September from an unnamed new customer that some analysts and market watchers speculated was OpenAI. Broadcom and OpenAI said today that the deployment of the new custom chips would be completed by the end of 2029, building on their existing co-development and supply agreements. The new systems will be scaled entirely using Broadcom's Ethernet and other networking gear, giving the company an edge over smaller rivals such as Marvell Technology and challenging Nvidia's InfiniBand networking solution. © RTÉ 2025.

October 13, 2025 09:46 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "North America Modular Construction Market Size, Share, Trends and Forecast by Division, Sector, Material, and Country, 2025-2033" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The North America modular construction market size was valued at USD 28.64 Billion in 2024. Looking forward, the market is set to reach USD 43.67 Billion by 2033, exhibiting a CAGR of 4.56% from 2025-2033. The market is driven by factors such as cost efficiency, reduced construction time, and increasing demand for sustainable, energy-efficient buildings. Additionally, the need for affordable housing, advancements in construction technology, and government incentives supporting green building practices are further driving market growth, positioning modular construction as a preferred solution. With increasing emphasis on eco-friendly building practices, modular construction is gaining traction due to its ability to incorporate sustainable materials, energy-efficient designs, and lower carbon footprints in comparison to conventional construction techniques. In addition, modular construction enables concurrent off-site fabrication and on-site setup, decreasing total construction duration. This efficiency is critical in sectors like residential housing and commercial buildings where time-to-market is crucial. Besides this, modular construction helps lower labor costs and reduces material waste due to controlled factory settings. The reduction in project timelines leads to significant savings, rendering it an appealing choice for developers. Furthermore, the rising need for cost-effective housing, especially in city regions, is making modular construction a preferred solution. It offers faster, cost-effective, and customizable options that can address the housing gap without sacrificing quality.Apart from this, the integration of technologies like automation, 3D printing, and building information modeling (BIM) is revolutionizing modular construction. These innovations improve precision, design flexibility, and scalability, making modular units more competitive with traditional construction methods. Moreover, governing bodies across North America are mandating energy-efficient building standards. Modular construction offers an ideal way to meet these standards through its ability to integrate advanced insulation, renewable energy systems, and energy-efficient materials. Additionally, the shortage of skilled labor in traditional construction is driving the North America modular construction market demand. Modular construction relies more on factory-based assembly, where less specialized labor is required, addressing the labor gap and ensuring projects stay on track. Competitive Landscape:Major participants in the market are concentrating on broadening their product ranges, enhancing manufacturing effectiveness, and incorporating cutting-edge technologies like 3D printing and automation. They are emphasizing sustainability by including environment-friendly materials and energy-saving designs in their modular units. These athletes are also building strategic alliances with suppliers and contractors to improve their supply chains and lower expenses. Furthermore, numerous entities are channeling funds into research initiatives to innovate and address the increasing need for budget-friendly housing and commercial properties. To remain competitive, they are broadening their geographical presence, especially in areas with strong construction demand, while also concentrating on mergers and acquisitions (M&A).North America Modular Construction Market Trends: Growing Adoption by Major Real Estate DevelopersLarge real estate developers are adopting modular construction for their residential and commercial projects due to its effectiveness, economical advantages, and sustainability perks. By integrating modular methods, developers can greatly shorten construction timelines, optimize budget management, and minimize waste. Additionally, this approach is highly customizable, allowing developers to meet specific design needs while maintaining cost control. As sustainability becomes a priority, modular buildings offer reduced environmental impact, with fewer materials wasted and a lower carbon footprint compared to traditional construction. This growing trend among prominent developers signals a shift towards scalable and innovative building solutions. As major players in the real estate market recognize the long-term financial and ecological advantages, the adoption of modular construction is expected to increase, encouraging further investment and expanding its role in the sector. In 2024, Greystar Real Estate Partners initiated its inaugural modular housing project in the US, Ltd. Findlay, located in Coraopolis, PA. The development included 312 apartments and highlights quicker building, savings on costs, and minimized waste. Greystar intends to grow its modular portfolio by adding additional projects in the US.Labor Shortages in the Construction IndustryLabor shortages are becoming a significant challenge in the traditional construction industry, contributing to delays and increased costs. Modular construction, however, helps mitigate this issue by reducing the dependency concerning skilled workers during the on-site assembly stage. A large part of the modular construction process takes place in regulated factory settings, where automated systems, machinery, and trained workers contribute to efficient production. This method helps bypass labor shortages while still delivering high-quality, durable structures. Additionally, modular construction reduces on-site work, allowing projects to proceed more quickly and without being hindered by fluctuations in available skilled labor. As labor shortages persist, modular construction's ability to streamline operations is making it an attractive alternative to conventional construction techniques. In 2024, Webcor, a commercial construction company based in California, declared the establishment of Webcor Ventures, LLC, and made its first investment in R2 Building, a company specializing in modular construction. The collaboration sought to tackle industry issues such as cost, efficiency, and workforce shortages by utilizing off-site manufacturing to create scalable, high-quality housing options.Government-Funded InitiativesGovernment funding initiatives are essential for fostering the development of modular construction in North America. These efforts offer financial assistance for creating innovative construction solutions, such as modular homes. Through the provision of grants, loans, and incentives, governing bodies in the region are enhancing the accessibility and appeal of modular construction for developers. Specifically, funding frequently targets tackling housing deficits and aiding infrastructure initiatives, enabling faster and more cost-effective building. Changes in regulations and affordable financing promote the use of modular construction, enabling developers to lower initial expenses and adhere to strict construction schedules. These government-supported initiatives are hastening the uptake of modular solutions, establishing them as a crucial approach to address urban housing needs while promoting efficiency and reducing costs. For example, in 2024, the Government of Canada launched two initiatives to speed up housing development. The Canada Housing Infrastructure Fund (CHIF) allocated $1 billion for necessary infrastructure, while the Regional Homebuilding Innovation Initiative (RHII) designated $50 million to encourage innovative home construction methods, including modular housing.

Title: Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs forces many retailers to be cautious on holiday hiring

By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO, AP Retail Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs is forcing retailers to pull back or delay plans to hire seasonal workers who pack orders at distribution centers, serve shoppers at stores and build holiday displays during the most important selling season of the year. American Christmas LLC, which creates elaborate holiday installations for commercial properties such as New York’s Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall, plans to hire 220 temporary workers and is ramping up recruitment nearly two months later than usual, CEO Dan Casterella said. Last year, it took on 300 people during its busy period. The main reason? The company wants to offset its tariff bill, which Casterella expects to be as big as $1.5 million this year, more than double last year’s $600,000. “The issue is if you overstaff and then you underperform, it’s too late,” Casterella said. ”I think everyone’s more mindful now than ever. ” Online behemoth Amazon Inc. said Monday it intends to hire 250,000 full-, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, the same level as a year ago. But job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas forecasts overall holiday hiring for the last three months of the year will likely fall under 500,000 positions. That’s fewer than last year’s 543,000 level and also marks the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years when retailers hired 495,800 temporary workers, the firm said. Among other companies cutting holiday payrolls: Radial, an e-commerce company that powers deliveries for roughly 120 companies like Lands’ End and Cole Haan and operates 20 fulfillment sites. It plans to hire 6,500 workers, fewer than last year’s 7,000, and is waiting to the last minute to ramp up hiring for some of its clients, chief human resources officer Sabrina Wnorowski, said. Bath & Body Works, based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, said it plans to hire 32,000 workers, below the 32,700 a year ago. “We saw real strong signals that there’s been a cooling in the labor market, even beyond what our expectations were in the first nine months of the year,” Challenger’s senior vice president Andy Challenger said. Challenger also noted companies are using artificial intelligence bots to replace some workers, particularly those working in call centers. And he’s also seeing companies hiring workers closer to when they need them. Meanwhile, the list of companies staying mum about their specific holiday hiring goals keeps growing. Target Corp., UPS and Macy’s are declining to offer figures, a departure from years past. Retailers’ hiring plans mark the first clues to what’s in store for the U.S. holiday shopping season and come as the U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly because Trump’s trade wars have created uncertainty that’s paralyzing managers trying to make hiring decisions. The Labor Department reported in early September that U.S. employers — companies, government agencies and nonprofits — added just 22,000 jobs in August, down from 79,000 in July and well below the 80,000 that economists had expected. The government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and has delayed the release of economic reports, could worsen the job picture. In an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues, the White House budget office said Friday mass firings of federal workers have started. Analysts will be closely monitoring the shutdown’s impact on spending. For now, many retailers say that consumers, while resilient, are selective. Analysts will also be watching how shoppers will react to price increases as a result of high tariff costs in the next few months, experts said. Given an economic slowdown, holiday spending growth is expected to be smaller than a year ago, according to several forecasts. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase last year. Deloitte Services LP forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31. That’s compares with 4.2% last year. And Adobe expects U.S. online sales to hit $253.4 billion from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, representing a 5.3% growth. That’s smaller than last year’s 8.7% growth. Companies are increasingly wanting to hire workers closer to when they need them, experts said. “In today’s environment, brands are really looking for us to be agile,” Radial’s Wnorowski said. So for some of its clients, Radial will now be hiring two weeks before Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start for the season, instead of four weeks before the kickoff. Radial is also training holiday hires faster with new technology that’s simplifying their tasks. It used to take a couple of days to train a worker, but now it only takes a couple of hours, she said. Meanwhile, Target will offer current workers additional hours and then will tap into a separate pool of workers— 43,000— who pick up shifts. The Minneapolis-based company also hires seasonal workers across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 distribution facilities to meet demand, it said. For the past few years, Walmart, the largest private employer, has been offering its workers extra hours available during the holidays, a Walmart spokesperson said, noting it’s worked well and the feedback from customers and workers has been “overwhelmingly positive.” The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said there may be some seasonal hiring on a store-by-store basis, but most locations will dole out those hours to current workers. Waiting until the last minute to hire could mean a mad scramble to find talent, but companies say that with the slowing economy, they don’t anticipate having a hard time. Meanwhile, the temporary halt of the release of economic reports leaves retailers in the dark about sales forecasts and the workers they may need. “Certainly, for our customers not having access to data will put more of a challenge on their ability to forecast,” Wnorowski of Radial said. “But we’ll stay very close to them as we go into peak and we’ll adjust as soon we see things changing.”

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom (AVGO) stock is down 9.6% in 21 trading days. Already own the stock? You might want to consider continuing holding it. Planning to buy? This might be your opportunity. Consider the following data: While we like to buy dips if the fundamentals check out - for AVGO, see Buy or Sell AVGO Stock - we are wary of falling knives. Specifically, it is worth trying to answer if things get really bad, and AVGO drops another 20-30% to $227 levels, will we be able to hold on to the stock? What is the worst case scenario? We call it downturn resilience. Turns out, the stock saw an impact slightly worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We assess this based on both (a) how much the stock fell and, (b) how quickly it recovered. AVGO stock has fallen meaningfully recently and we currently find it attractive but volatile. While this may feel like an opportunity, there is significant risk in relying on a single stock. On the other hand, there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach. If you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) - HQ has outperformed its benchmark - a combination of S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index, and achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Risk management is key - consider, what could long-term portfolio performance be if you blended 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with HQ’s performance metrics. Below are the details, but before that, as a quick background: AVGO provides semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, including set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 Covid Pandemic 2018 Correction Worried that AVGO could fall much more? You could take a look at the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

The Culver City, Calif.-based animation and visual effects studio does it all — the production of the wildly successful “Sonic the Hedgehog” movies and the Emmy-nominated animated anthology series “Love, Death & Robots” (on Netflix) and “Secret Level” (on Prime Video); video game cut scenes for AAA titles like “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare;” the jaw-dropping opening credits for David Fincher’s “Girl With the Dragon Tattoo:” and even the animation for Universal Studios’ The Simpsons Ride. Its 2004 animated short film “Gopher Broke,” directed by Jeff Fowler (who would go on to direct the “Sonic the Hedgehog” movies), was nominated for an Oscar. Tim Miller, the company’s co-founder and owner, directed the first “Deadpool” movie and 2019’s “Terminator: Dark Fate.” But perhaps more impressive than the output is its financial performance. Blur Studio is profitable and has never been in debt or had outside financing or loans against the company. It was founded in 1995 and has roughly 100 employees. In an interview with TheWrap, Miller described Blur as “a company built by artists, for artists, to create content that I feel like otherwise wouldn’t make it to screens, big and small.” Nan Morales, Blur’s president, added, “I also think we spent the last few years recruiting the best teams globally and we’re building the community for the visual work and storytelling.” Its success stands in stark contrast with most visual effects houses that have trouble remaining afloat. The challenges emerge from productions awarding jobs to the lowest-bidder, creating an untenable situation when projects stretch over months and filmmakers demand countless VFX iterations — the impact being massive blockbusters with poor CGI scenes and a rising number of visual effects houses closing. So how did Blur avoid this fate? “I would love to say that it’s all due to precise planning and pinpoint accuracy and focus. But a lot of it is luck,” Miller said. “We got into the games industry, which to some degree has been protected by tax incentives, and it’s an industry that we love, which is the luckiest thing. We get to work with these great partners on this cutting edge technology, on the kind of subject matter that, honestly, I always wanted to work on.” The tax incentives that protected video game production allowed Blur to stay in Los Angeles at a time when studios were fleeing to Vancouver or London. Although the video game industry isn’t immune to periods of decline, as sweeping layoffs have hit major game companies over the last few years. Which makes Blur’s diversification all the more important. Miller said that most of Blur’s output is “work for hire.” There are plenty of projects that Blur is developing in-house but they function primarily as a studio who is hired by outside companies – video game publishers and streaming studios – to create content for them. Blur then partners with other studios to make sure that all the work gets done. This approach also adds visual variety to projects, like the different art styles and aesthetics that populate both “Love, Death & Robots” (developed in-house by Blur and streaming on Netflix) and “Secret Level” (a project that originated with Sony’s video game division and streams on Prime Video). “When I started the studio, it was because I thought nobody would let me direct an animated film unless I actually owned a studio that could do it, which was my reason for building it,” Miller said. But he’s also thankful he has “Love, Death & Robots,” an R-rated animated anthology series full of sex and violence that Blur produces and which allows him to “hire our competitors in the game cinematic space.” “They’re all people that normally are competing for jobs against us, which is great because it’s this really tight community of really driven boutique studios where I think the best artists are. On ‘Love, Death & Robots,’ we’ll do two or three episodes every season. And for now, for ‘Secret Level,’ we’ll do two or three episodes ourselves, and then we spread the love around.” When Miller started Blur in the 1995, the same year that Pixar released the first feature-length computer animated film “Toy Story,” he wanted to be “the dark Pixar and build this big company.” Los Angeles was the epicenter for the emerging computer animation movement. Now? “That’s not so much my goal,” Miller said. “It’s not sustainable,” Morales said of making that dream a reality. “We’re not seeing a business practice that that’s a sustainable market. We’re a small, boutique shop. We’re like 100 employees. People think we’re huge. We’re not. That’s why we have to have our vendor partners and seek out the best people that are out there.” Blur is an animation studio that develops projects and animates parts of those projects but also partners with other studios to complete the work. Blur might animate an entire opening title sequence or video game cinematic, but on larger, more complex projects like “Love, Death & Robots,” they’ll work with other studios to bring most of the segments to life. And on even the biggest projects, like the “Sonic the Hedgehog” movies (and the Paramount+ spinoff series “Knuckles”), studios like MPC and Industrial Light & Magic also worked on the effects and animation. It used to be that animation studios would do all the work for a single project, but it’s becoming more commonplace for a studio to work on most of the animation while also farming out different sections. DreamWorks Animation’s recent “The Bad Guys 2,” for example, had some key sequences handled by Sony Pictures Imageworks. Blur was quietly ahead of the curve. The work is having an impact on the industry. Morales talked about a small studio Blur worked with that was flying under the radar but was able to hire 150 people for a big job because of its work on “Secret Level.” “These boutique shops are doing quite well from ‘Secret Level’ and ‘Love Death & Robots,’ in the sense that their work is being shown globally,” Morales said. She added that this work keeps other studios from faltering. “2024 was awful,” Morales said. “I came into a huge dip in the economy for trailers and cinematics and even content. It just died out. In 2025, we did okay, and hopefully we keep going forward, it’s a struggle for everyone out there. And I’m really happy the way we have built a community of sharing, trying to help everyone stay afloat. It’s not the big companies, it’s the small companies that have to stand around, to make it competitive out there.” But while keeping Blur small makes the economics of the company work in its favor, Miller also has a creative reason for doing so. “My reason for the size of the company, is I realized I’m selfish, and running a big company doesn’t excite me as much as doing the work,” Miller said. “The only reason to be that big would be to get rich. And that doesn’t interest me nearly as much as making stuff.” Miller said that the model that they’ve worked out, where they collaborate with their partners and friends, is ideal. That way, when they come off of a show, they aren’t forced with cutting payroll or hours or employees just to stay afloat. “I’m working on a new idea to split the difference between a loose alliance of sorts that might help all the problems that these smaller studios face,” Miller teased. “But do I think about being a big behemoth? Those days might be over.” A major disrupter is entering the industry in the form of AI, with its magical promises of being able to produce entire animated films and cut the need for human creatives significantly (which so far, haven’t been fulfilled). But the process has an uncanny ability to mimic actual art, as was seen by the wave of Hayao Miyazaki rip-offs that flooded social media earlier this year. In June, Miller was on a panel at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival where other speakers were “dancing around the issue.” He dove right in. “I was like, ‘Why are you guys talking like this thing may go away or it may not be a factor or if we close our eyes, it might not exist? It’s not going to happen.’” In the past, any new technology or tool that would come along, Miller and other creatives in the field would jump on it, “because it would increase my creative abilities.” Not when it comes to AI. “I’ve seen a real resistance to the AI tools, and I get it, it feels like an existential threat to their jobs, and by extension, their families and their lives. I think that’s a very justified and real concern for the industry. I understand the terror, but it means that people stay away from it, and they cover their eyes and pretend it doesn’t happen,” Miller said, noting he would rather be in control of the technology than leave it to a large corporation. Miller and Blur had developed an adaptation of English author China Miéville’s 2000 novel “Perdido Street Station” at Amazon, which is no longer moving forward. The project was, in Miller’s estimation “incredibly complicated – lots of characters and creatures and everything.” The property was decidedly “not for kids” and would have been “prohibitively expensive to make with the traditional tools.” “But AI gives us a chance at using the efficiencies that it could bring to all parts of the pipeline to tell a story at a cost that it can afford to not be for 11-year-olds,” Miller said. “That kind of s–t gives me hope. It shouldn’t cost $200 million to make a movie.” “It’s innovation of tools,” Morales said of AI. “It’s not replacing the artist … As a tool base to allow us some more latitude and be able to create environments that aren’t key elements to a storytelling, I think people will accept that, and it will help us bring more stories to the public.” Not that she’s totally sold. She recently saw some AI-generated “content” (her word) and she found it wanting. “It’s not very visually pleasing,” Morales said. Miller was reluctant to get in a debate about what AI can or can’t do, because it might be able to do something that we don’t even know about yet. Still, it’s enough for Miller to quote Arthur C. Clarke – “the future is not only stranger than you imagine, it’s stranger than you can imagine.” “I feel a bit of that right now,” Miller admitted. “I personally believe that for the next 12 months, our plan is to not replace our pipeline. It’s about what parts of the process can we make better and more efficient. On the production side, being able to look at the data of how we do things and how long it takes and where we put our focus is as important as the actual pixel manipulation.” One thing that has remained slightly out of reach for Miller and the team at Blur has been the production of an animated feature. Morales said that the company can “definitely do” an animated feature and Miller said, “We have to work with our partners.” He said that “The Goon” — a graphic novel adaptation that Blur Studio and David Fincher have been trying to get off the ground since 2008 — had recently been set up at Netflix. It took a year to put the deal together. And a month after they signed the agreement, Netflix told them, “We’re not going to do adult animated features anymore.” “I’m like, Oh my God, f–king kill me,” Miller said. It just made him more determined to make it himself. Miller said that he’s sympathetic to what happens to these movies at studios, but Blur is always seemingly caught in those corporate crosshairs. “We’ve got so much cool stuff developed and then somebody leaves and the new person doesn’t like it or somebody doesn’t have the power to push it through,” he said. “Love, Death & Robots,” for instance, initially started life as a reboot of the animated anthology film “Heavy Metal,” based on the American comic book magazine known for its bleak, but visually lush, sci-fi, fantasy and horror elements. Miller had some amazing directors lined up to direct individual segments, including Fincher, Gore Verbinski, Zack Snyder, Guillermo del Toro and James Cameron. But after more than a decade, he pivoted and turned it into a television series, which has now had 45 episodes and received multiple Emmy wins, and remains one of the most exciting animated series currently streaming. Morales said that when she came to Blur, “I could see the future and the animation space filling in the live-action, tentpole movie space, when studios are looking at $200 million+ and I know in animation we could do that for a lot less and give them the same quality.” She points to the “Warhammer” episode of “Secret Level,” which is just as tense and thrilling as any live-action feature, rendered gorgeously (and in a video game engine, no less) for a fraction of the cost of, say, the latest Marvel Studios movie. “When I walked in the first day and talked to Tim and saw ‘Warhammer,’ I said, ‘That’s the future. That’s the future of big movies,” Morales said. “We have to embrace that and show that skill.’ And I think Blur can lead that charge for a lot of people. We’re seeing the ability to do it right now. It’s just actually putting it out there.” Using a video game engine to make an entire animated feature, or even part of an animated feature, would be a breakthrough, but the world of visual effects has been embracing the technology over the past few years. The most notable example of this is The Volume, the virtual stage system that Industrial Light & Magic developed and first employed on Lucasfilm’s Disney+ streaming series “The Mandalorian.” The technology, dubbed StageCraft, utilizes real-time computing and video game engines to create animated backdrops and star-fields live on set, instead of using a blue or green screen and filling it in later. And it’s being employed on movies that don’t take place in a galaxy far, far away, most recently on the Colin Farrell/Margot Robbie romantic fantasy “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey,” which debuted last month. Maybe the biggest challenge Miller faces, he said, is the “big group of people who just don’t like animation.” “They’re not going to come inside the tent. But if we can get across the uncanny valley, and I do think we’re almost there, then that opens up a whole different world of stories for animation,” Miller said. “It opens up a whole different demo of people who will watch the content because it looks like live action, or close enough to live action that it’ll get us across. I mean, video games did a lot to bring people into the adult animation tent.” About 15 years ago, a trailer surfaced for an adaptation of Eric Powell’s beloved comic book series “The Goon.” The brief clip, directed by Miller, was visually inventive and a loving reinvention of the source material. An eventual movie, produced by Fincher, was proposed, with a Kickstarter campaign launched to cover necessary pre-production costs. But the latest setback at Netflix hasn’t deterred Miller. Maybe, with the right tools, he says, it can finally see the light of day instead of remaining on Blur’s perpetual to-do list. “I don’t give up,” Miller said. “I never give up.” And you tend to believe him.

Title: Step Into The Shadows And Take A Peek At My Purloined Portfolio

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. Do you keep an eye on your competition? Of course you do. Competition research is common sense. When you think a competitor has a great idea, adopt it or adapt it. In that spirit, once a year I compile a Purloined Portfolio, consisting of one stock from each of five rival investment managers I respect. Here goes. I’ve always been a fan of Scott Black, who heads Delphi Management in Boston. Black is a major art collector and Democratic Party donor. He is featured in Barron’s magazine each year on its stock-picking panel. From his holdings, I select Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B). Berkshire has been run for six decades by investment legend Warren Buffett, who plans to relinquish the helm at the end of this year. I think he has a good team in place, led by Greg Abel, who will be the next CEO. I regard Berkshire as the country’s most successful conglomerate. I don’t advocate breaking it up, but if Abel needed or wanted to sell off some of the pieces, I think he could reap high valuations for many of them. Randall Eley runs pension-fund money and the Edgar Lomax Value Fund (LOMAX) in Alexandria, Virginia. His largest holding is CVS Health Corp. (CVS). You might be surprised by this choice, since the stock has lost 24% of its value over the past decade. I think CVS is poised for a comeback. One of its competitors, Rite Aid, has declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. Its largest competitor, Walgreens, seems to me to have lost some of its mojo. CVS is considering selling or splitting off Caremark (a pharmacy benefits manager) and Aetna (a health insurer). I’m in favor of such a move. I believe that pharmacy benefits management has build-in conflicts of interest. As for health insurance, I think it’s a difficult business because of rising health-care costs. The core drugstore business is the one that most appeals to me. A veteran international stock picker, Benard (Bernie) Horn runs the Polaris Global Value Fund. From his holdings I draw Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (MUFG). It’s the largest bank in Japan, and also owns approximately 23% of Morgan Stanley, a big investment bank in the U.S. In the past four quarters, Mitsubishi UFJ has seen profits climb 29%, on a 10% increase in revenue. Most analysts expect growth to slow down. Should you buy it? Analytical opinion is split, but I think the present valuation (14 times recent earnings and 1.3 times book value) leaves room for more gains. Matrix Asset Advisors in New York City manages a little over $1 billion, with David Katz as chief investment officer. One of the stocks he owns is L3 Harris Technologies Inc. (LHX), a defense contractor that specializes in military electronics. I think that ISR – intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance – is already vital to national defense, and will become even more so. That why I like L3 Harris even though it’s more expensive than I normally go for. The stock trades at 33 times recent earnings and 24 times estimated earnings. The Buffalo International Fund, run by Nicole Kornitzer, is up more than 16% this year through October 10. From Kornitzer’s holdings, I choose the same stock I did last year, Taiwan Semiconductors Manufacturing Co. (TSM). In the past year, it’s up 47%. It might seem crazy to hope for more, but I do. Every major semiconductor company I know, except Intel Corp. (INTC), uses TSM to manufacture its chips. Thus, TSM is at the very heart of the global economy. Of course, there is geopolitical risk: An invasion of Taiwan by China is a real threat. In the past year (October 14, 2024 through October 10, 2025) my Purloined Portfolio returned 20.1%, including dividends. That handily beat the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index, which returned 13.3%. Leading the charge was Taiwan Semiconductor’s 47% return. Also doing well was J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), drawn from David Katz’s holdings. My worst selection was Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB), which declined 27%. The long-term results are also favorable. In 21 years, my Purloined Portfolios have averaged 13.2%, while the S&P 500 has averaged 11.6%. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Of the 21 stolen-idea lists, 17 have been profitable and 11 have beaten the S&P. Disclosure: I own Berkshire Hathaway, J.P. Morgan Chase, Mitsubishi UFG and Taiwan Semiconductor personally and for most of my clients. John Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston. His firm of clients may own or trade securities discussed in this column. He can be reached at jdorfman@dorfmanvalue.com.

Title: Up 4x This Year, Does AST SpaceMobile Stock's Rally Have Legs?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/13/up-4x-this-year-does-ast-spacemobile-stocks-rally-have-legs/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. AST SpaceMobile stock (NASDAQ:ASTS) soared nearly 32% last week and has risen almost 4x year-to-date. The company is constructing a space-based cellular broadband network that connects directly to standard smartphones without requiring additional hardware for commercial and governmental utilization. The recent increase followed the announcement of a significant commercial partnership with Verizon to offer space-based cellular coverage throughout the continental U.S. beginning in 2026. This agreement enhances an initial strategic partnership from last year by formalizing the commercial rollout, integrating AST’s satellite network with Verizon's terrestrial infrastructure, and expanding Verizon’s 850 MHz spectrum coverage into remote regions. The agreement fortifies AST’s position against rivals such as SpaceX's Starlink and assists in strengthening its relationships with leading U.S. telecom providers. ASTS stock has experienced a substantial rise recently, yet there is considerable risk in depending on a single stock. Conversely, there is great value in a broader diversified strategy we adopt with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, ponder what the long-term performance of your portfolio could look like if you combined 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with equities. There is a continuous competition to establish broadband services via satellites, with Elon Musk’s SpaceX currently leading with over 8,000 Starlink satellites already in orbit. However, AST SpaceMobile’s approach diverges in crucial ways. While Starlink focuses on consumers directly by offering hardware and internet subscriptions, AST’s satellites are engineered to operate like space-based cell towers, integrating directly into the networks of existing mobile operators such as AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten, and Verizon. This strategy allows users to access connectivity through these satellites using their regular smartphones and current SIM cards, helping to remove coverage dead zones. During its Q2 2025 earnings report, the company stated that it had verified a plan to launch 45 to 60 satellites into orbit by 2026 to energize cellular-based broadband networks. The firm aims to conduct orbital launches every one to two months on average throughout 2025 and 2026 and mentioned that the satellites are fully funded. For telecom providers, the value proposition is considerable. Collaborating with AST enables them to extend 4G and 5G coverage into deserts, oceans, mountainous regions, and other underserved locales where conventional towers are not financially viable. This allows them to offer truly nationwide or even global coverage to clients. These advantages can enhance customer satisfaction and open new revenue opportunities without telecom providers needing to incur the substantial costs associated with rural infrastructure. Instead of advertising directly to consumers, AST generates revenue by charging telecom providers for access to its satellite capacity, with pricing determined by usage or through long-term contracts. This model could afford AST a recurring, high-margin revenue stream while solidifying deep partnerships across the international telecom sector. AST has reportedly engaged with over 50 mobile network operators globally, enabling them to serve nearly 3 billion subscribers. With a market capitalization of approximately $31 billion, ASTS is trading at over 500x the consensus revenue projection for 2025 of $60 million and 120x the estimated revenue for 2026. This represents a steep valuation considering that the company is still in the nascent stages of its operations. Nonetheless, growth has been rapid, although on a small base, with revenues increasing 249% over the previous year to $4.9 million. See ASTS Revenue Comparison. Losses remain substantial, with operating losses amounting to $260 million over the last 12 months. ASTS has performed significantly worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. During the 2022 inflation shock market crash, ASTS stock plummeted 68.5% from a peak of $22.50 on February 9, 2021, to $7.08 on June 1, 2021, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500.

Nonetheless, the company continues to possess a robust balance sheet, with $924 million in cash and cash equivalents, a debt-to-equity ratio of merely 4.3%, and cash accounting for nearly half of its total assets. This financial flexibility ought to provide AST the necessary runway to implement its satellite deployment strategy, although investors will need to exercise patience as the company transitions from technology deployment to commercial-scale revenue generation. Robust demand is one of the factors we consider in our High-Quality portfolio, which has surpassed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What accounts for this? As a collective group, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; experiencing less volatility, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Why Oracle Stock Rose 122% In 6 Months
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/13/why-oracle-stock-rose-122-in-6-months/
Time Published: 2025-10-13T11:01:45Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From a quantitative perspective, the 122.2% change in Oracle (ORCL) stock between April 13, 2025, and October 10, 2025, was primarily driven by a 119.3% expansion in the company’s P/E multiple. There’s more to this story than numbers alone—but first, let’s break down the movement and its key contributors. Single stock can be risky, but there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach we take with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We go beyond just equities. Is a portfolio of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto in addition to equities and bonds - likely to return more during the next 1-3 years, and protect you better if markets crash 20%? We have crunched the numbers. Coming back to the "change": The change in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue and margins, has an underlying business and investor sentiment story behind it. Below, we have identified key developments that influenced stock price movement for ORCL stock. Before that, as a quick background: ORCL provides cloud software as a service, industry-specific cloud solutions, application licenses, license support, an enterprise database, a development language, and middleware services. Opinion: We currently find ORCL stock relatively expensive. Why so? Have a look at the full story. Read Buy or Sell ORCL Stock to see what drives our current opinion. Risk: That said, Oracle isn’t immune to big drops. It plunged nearly 77% in the Dot-Com Bubble and slid over 41% during the Global Financial Crisis. The Inflation Shock wasn’t kind either, with a 40% dip. Even the smaller events — 2018 Correction and Covid Pandemic — pushed it down around 19% and 29% respectively. Solid fundamentals matter, but when sell-offs hit, Oracle can see serious pullbacks. Picking winners on a consistent basis is not an easy task - especially given the volatility associated with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: H-1B visa crackdown not an existential threat to TCS; CEO Krithivasan says firm 'can survive'
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/h1b-visa-crackdown-not-an-existential-threat-to-tcs-ceo-krithivasan-says-firm-can-survive-11760337946989.html
Time Published: 2025-10-13T07:08:48Z
Full Content:
Amid the uncertainty around H-1B visas, Tata Consultancy Services' (TCS) K Krithivasan has opened up about the IT giant's view on the work visa, restrictions on which, introduced by US President Donald Trump, have rocked the industry. Krithivasan's comments take on particular importance, with TCS being the second-biggest beneficiary of the H-1B programme in 2025 after Amazon, with over 5,000 H-1B visas approved in 2025 alone. In an interview with Business Standard, Krithivasan addressed not just concerns regarding the work visa, but also spoke about the company's recent move to lay off 12,000 people globally. On the back of the layoffs, US Senators Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin had raised questions about the company hiring over 5,500 H-1B workers, which the tech CEO addressed directly in the interview. Commenting on facing questions from US Senators, Krithivasan said, "I was neither happy nor unhappy. It gave me an opportunity to articulate our positions more clearly and to address the Senators’ questions about the H-1B issue." Explaining that the "figure of 5,500" pertained to people amending or renewing their H-1B petitions, the TCS CEO said that fresh applications were much lower, "probably around 2,500". "We have 31,000 to 32,000 employees in the US, of whom only 11,000 to 12,000 are on H-1B visas, while the rest are on other types of visas. We have been progressively increasing local workforce participation, which will continue because the way of work has changed with new kinds of projects and AI coming into play, where you need to work closely with the customer and need different skill sets," Krithivasan was quoted as saying. "It is not just about engineering skills anymore; there is a growing demand for creative thinking and prompt engineering skills. In FY26, we sent just 500 people from India to the US on H-1B visas, which means we can survive without them (H-1B visas). There is no dependence on H-1B visas," the TCS CEO, most notably, said. "There was a time when this was a significant retention policy, but over the past four-five years, it has been on a declining trend. It is now far less of a retention policy than it once was, and we should not be assessing today’s scenario through yesterday’s lens," he added. When quizzed about the mass layoffs at TCS, Krithivasan explained that only two categories of employees had been affected: those on the bench for three to six months, and those who were underperforming. "I don’t believe the Tata group, while humane, would have retained employees with performance issues," the chief of the IT giant was quoted as saying. He also explained that a "skill mismatch" also contributed to some of the layoffs. "We have relieved individuals where we see a skill mismatch for the future. The company is pivoting to be future-ready and a big player in the AI ecosystem. If someone doesn’t fit into the scheme of things, we need to exit them gracefully. This approach, I believe, does not conflict with our ethos," Krithivasan said. The Trump administration, which has described the H-1B programme as the one of the "most abused visa" systems in the US' immigration framework, recently slapped a $100,000 ( ₹88 lakh) fee on fresh applications, sending shockwaves across firms that rely on the programme to employ highly-skilled talent from around the world.

October 13, 2025 – OpenAI and Broadcom have announced a landmark strategic collaboration to co-develop and deploy 10 gigawatts of OpenAI-designed AI accelerators and Broadcom Ethernet-based networking systems, setting the stage for the next generation of large-scale AI infrastructure. Under this multi-year partnership, OpenAI will design custom AI accelerators and systems, while Broadcom will manufacture and deploy the hardware across global data centers. The deployment is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2026 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2029. This partnership combines OpenAI’s frontier AI research and model expertise with Broadcom’s industry-leading semiconductor and networking technology, enabling the creation of scalable, power-efficient AI clusters. The systems will utilize Broadcom’s end-to-end Ethernet, PCIe, and optical connectivity solutions, providing the foundation for OpenAI’s next generation of large-scale AI workloads. “Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI’s potential and deliver real benefits for people and businesses,” said Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI. “Developing our own accelerators adds to the broader ecosystem of partners all building the capacity required to push the frontier of AI to provide benefits to all humanity.” “Broadcom’s collaboration with OpenAI signifies a pivotal moment in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence,” said Hock Tan, President and CEO of Broadcom. “We are thrilled to co-develop and deploy 10 gigawatts of next-generation accelerators and network systems to pave the way for the future of AI.” The initiative marks a significant shift in how OpenAI approaches infrastructure design. By creating its own chips, OpenAI gains direct control over the optimization of hardware for its models, integrating lessons learned from developing GPT models and other frontier systems. “Our collaboration with Broadcom will power breakthroughs in AI and bring the technology’s full potential closer to reality,” said Greg Brockman, co-founder and President of OpenAI. “By building our own chip, we can embed what we’ve learned from creating frontier models and products directly into the hardware, unlocking new levels of capability and intelligence.” Broadcom emphasized that the collaboration highlights the importance of Ethernet as the backbone of AI data center scalability, providing flexibility and efficiency across massive distributed clusters. “Our partnership with OpenAI continues to set new industry benchmarks for the design and deployment of open, scalable, and power-efficient AI clusters,” said Charlie Kawwas, Ph.D., President of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group. “Custom accelerators combine remarkably well with standards-based Ethernet scale-up and scale-out networking to provide cost and performance-optimized next-generation AI infrastructure.” The collaboration arrives as demand for AI compute infrastructure continues to surge worldwide. With over 800 million weekly active users across ChatGPT and other OpenAI products, and strong adoption from enterprises and developers, the new accelerator systems aim to future-proof OpenAI’s global infrastructure and advance its mission of ensuring artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.

He's just written a book called "1929" about the market crash a century ago. We wondered if he'd run out of news to cover, or is he alerting us that what's been happening in the markets lately – is a replay of what led to the most devastating financial collapse in our history? Imagine the New York Stock Exchange back then: the crush of frightened traders dumping stocks, investors losing their shirts, businesses, their homes, sweeping away the Roaring '20s, walking that same but transformed floor today. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Everything's digital. Lesley Stahl: Well, yeah, OK. Andrew Ross Sorkin says we're in our own roaring '20s: the 2020s. with stocks climbing for months, just like then. Andrew Ross Sorkin: The crazy part about this is, from 1928 to September of 1929, the stock market was up 90%! Lesley Stahl: When you say the stock market was way up, immediately I think of now. Are you scared? Andrew Ross Sorkin: I'm anxious. I'm anxious that we are at prices that may not feel sustainable. And what I don't know is we are either living through some kind of remarkable boom and part of that's artificial intelligence and technology and all of that, or everything's overpriced. Lesley Stahl: Or we're reliving-- Andrew Ross Sorkin: 1929. Andrew Ross Sorkin: There was so much anxiety. Sorkin has covered the markets for two decades. He joined the New York Times after college, soon founding the DealBook newsletter covering finance. He also co-hosts "Squawk Box" on CNBC, runs the DealBook Summit, where he interviews the high and mighty, he co-created "Billions" the TV show, wrote a bestseller about the 2008 crash, and now, a book about 1929. Lesley Stahl: We're always being undone by bubbles. There was the internet bubble in 2000, the housing in 2008. Are we in another bubble? An AI bubble or something like that? Andrew Ross Sorkin: I think it's hard to say we're not in a bubble of some sort. The question is always when is the bubble going to pop? Lesley Stahl: One symptom of a bubble is when the market goes up and up, but the underlying economy – the real economy - goes soft. And that appears to be happening right now. Andrew Ross Sorkin: I would argue to you that the economy is being propped up, almost artificially, by the artificial intelligence boom. There are hundreds of billions of dollars that are being invested today in artificial intelligence. This is either a gold rush or a sugar rush and we probably won't know for a couple of years which one it is. 1929 was a sugar rush caused by speculation and debt. People who didn't really have much money were lured by Wall Street bankers to invest using a newfangled concept to take on debt, called credit. You only had to put down 10% of the stock price, borrowing the rest from your broker. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Prior to 1919, most people did not take on credit or debt at all. It was a sin. It was a moral sin to use credit– Lesley Stahl: Oh, really? Andrew Ross Sorkin: --to buy anything. And it was really General Motors that basically came up with the idea that we're gonna lend you money so you can afford to buy our cars. Lesley Stahl: Brilliant. Andrew Ross Sorkin: And then the bankers realize what's happening, and they realize that they can lend out money so that more folks can buy stocks. It was all sort of wrapped in the flag of democratizing access. And in good times, when the stock is going up, it's like free money. In bad times, you're on the hook, and you're on the hook in a very bad way. Since then, laws, regulations, and agencies have been put in place to protect investors - especially the less affluent - from being exploited. Lesley Stahl: We put up barriers after 1929. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Yes. Lesley Stahl: Protections. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Yes. Lesley Stahl: So those are coming down. They're tumbling down one -- the SEC rules aren't as stringent anymore. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Yes. The Consumer Protection Bureau practically doesn't exist anymore. Lesley Stahl: Correct. Andrew Ross Sorkin: That's what concerns me. It's not that we're going off a cliff tomorrow. It's that there's speculation in the market today, there's an increasing amount of debt in the market today, and all of that's happening against the backdrop of the guardrails coming off. Including guardrails that allow only the wealthy to invest directly in private companies that have fewer regulations, like AI startups before they go public. Andrew Ross Sorkin: So over the last 20 or 30 years, folks who had access to, who could invest in private equity, in venture capital, clearly outperformed folks who didn't. And so– Lesley Stahl: That's how you really made money. But you have to remember that these kind of assets are gambles. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Public companies, after the SEC was created, were required to have all sorts of disclosure rules so that the public could understand what's going on inside them. Private companies don't have that. But historically, the average ordinary American wasn't really allowed to invest in the private companies. But in this flag of democratizing finance, there's a lot of people who want access to that. Lesley Stahl: Wow. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Isn't this something? Lesley Stahl: This is spectacular. Sorkin took us to the Fifth Avenue mansion of one of the big bankers back then, who pushed democratization. Lesley Stahl: If this idea of bringing a regular guy into buying stock, if that was a big problem back in 1929 why are we going there again? Doesn't it defy some kind of logic? Andrew Ross Sorkin: There is a view that it's been only the elites that have had access to these investments, Facebook before it ever went public, Uber before it went public. So there is this idea that it's unfair, actually, to the ordinary investor because we haven't allowed them to get access to some of these investment opportunities early. And there is a real push, partially by the Trump administration, partially by the industry itself, which wants to– Lesley Stahl: Get more money. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Get more money in-- to open up the market to more and more people. Lesley Stahl: So we have these guardrails for a reason. I mean, they're there to protect, and they have protected. Andrew Ross Sorkin: They have protected a lot of people, but some people would say they protected people from getting rich. Larry Fink: Many people don't believe in capitalism anymore. And I think a lot of it is because they were not a part of the growth of the economy. We went to Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, the world's biggest money manager, handling $12.5 trillion in assets, like pension funds. His annual letter to investors is a kind of industry roadmap. This latest one he suggested opening our retirement 401(k)s – bastions of caution – to riskier private investments in the name of, wait for it: democratizing investing. Larry Fink: As I wrote, there are many great opportunities to be investing in the s- in startup companies, to invest in AI or data centers. Right now, we're precluded to put those type of assets in many retirement products. And the Trump administration has now said we're going to allow in our 401(k) products the opportunity to invest in these private markets. Lesley Stahl: But, they are risky. Aren't they? Larry Fink: Yes. But everything is risky other than keeping your money in a bank account overnight. Lesley Stahl: But we're talking about 401(k)s. Larry Fink: Yes. Lesley Stahl: Investing out of retirement accounts. Larry Fink: Yes. Lesley Stahl: You're risking the nest egg or part of the-- a little part of the nest egg. Larry Fink: But what the markets will teach you over the last 100 years, even at the worst moments, if you have the ability to persevere and you have a long-term horizon, you're going to do fine. And a diversified portfolio is essential. We're not suggesting, you know, one shoe fits all. We are suggesting the opportunity to have that ability to invest in these private market investments. He also believes we should be investing in crypto. Lesley Stahl: It wasn't that long ago that the big bankers, Jamie Dimon and Larry Fink, were saying that crypto was stupid and a fraud. Larry Fink: I did say Bitcoin, because we were talking about Bitcoin then, was the domain of money launderers and thieves. But you know, the markets teach you, you have to always relook at your assumptions. There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold, that is it's an alternative. For those looking to diversify this is not a bad asset, but I don't believe that it should be a large component of your portfolio. But Sorkin says some crypto can be abused in ways similar to 1929. Take meme coins: cryptocurrencies that can be manipulated by speculators who pumped them up, then let them crash. Andrew Ross Sorkin: There are a number of examples where it felt like there was an inside group of people who were colluding to pump up some of these cryptocurrencies, and other things. I'll give you a bizarre story of my own. I was on television with Larry Fink, and he makes a joke, I think, about how there should be a Sorkin coin. Well, two hours later, somebody makes a Sorkin coin. And all of a sudden, this Sorkin coin is now worth millions of dollars. And I'm watching it. Lesley Stahl: Are you serious? Andrew Ross Sorkin: Go up, and up, and up, and up, and up. The sorkin coin peaked at $170 million worth of trading in a day. Andrew Ross Sorkin: And I think today it does something like $20 or $21 a day, so… Lesley Stahl: [makes spiral noise] Sorkin is trusted by the world's top business leaders, who talk to him often exclusively. Lesley Stahl: What role do you think these business leaders should be playing now? Andrew Ross Sorkin: My own view is that most CEOs in America today are very scared to speak out publicly about anything. They are so worried that they are going to be potentially attacked by the administration, or regulated. They're gonna have a merger in front of some agency that's not gonna be allowed to go through. They are so nervous about criticizing anything that's going on with this administration. Lesley Stahl: There are some economists who suggest that because Mr. Trump ties his success to the success of the market, that he's not gonna let anything like what happened in 1929 happen. And that we should feel secure because of that. Andrew Ross Sorkin: I think it's hard to know how things get out of control. When confidence disappears, it happens like this. [SNAP] Lesley Stahl: So, you spent nearly 10 years on this book. The inevitable question is: do you think that we will have a crash or not? Andrew Ross Sorkin: The answer is we will have a crash; I just can't tell you when, and I can't tell you how deep. But I can assure you, unfortunately, I wish I wasn't saying this, we will have a crash. Produced by Shachar Bar-On. Associate producer, Jinsol Jung. Broadcast associate, Aria Een.

October 12, 2025 19:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Oct. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “Welcome to the 24th issue of our Weekly Report. Sorry for showing up in a cap today. I’ve been dealing with a very serious case of shingles on my head these past few days, which has affected my condition a bit. Everyone, please also take good care of your health and get enough rest. On EAI Flywheel this week, starting with S1 User Ecosystem: This week, FX signed a deposit agreement for 1,000 units of FX Super One with ZEVO, the pioneer of peer-to-peer EV sharing platform in the U.S. The agreement includes non-refundable deposits and non-binding preorders, and the non-refundable deposit has already been received. The signing of this agreement not only marks that FX’s Co-Creation Ecosystem Online Direct Sales model has expanded into Texas, the second-largest EV market in the United States. It also represents another innovative breakthrough in our B2B2C sales model. Following the car rental, FX Par, real estate brokerage, and MCN agencies, FX has now also entered the rapidly growing peer-to-peer car-sharing market. Based in Dallas, ZEVO not only allows individual car owners to list their own EVs for user-to-user sharing but also provides flexible short-term rental programs for ride-hailing and instant-delivery drivers. Its business has now expanded to core cities in Texas, California, Arizona, Florida, and Nevada. Through the cooperation with ZEVO, FX not only further expands the sales and use cases of FX Super One, but is also expected to speed up the implementation of our co-creation and sharing ecosystem. At the same time, when the car-sharing business and CXC10’s Three Growth Engines spark meta-chemistry — especially through the EAI + Crypto Dual-Bridge RWA products — new possibilities will emerge. The value of real-world mobility will be redefined and expanded in Web3 scenarios. This meta-chemistry could greatly accelerate the convergence of Web2 and Web3, and of EAI and Crypto, creating the greatest value for our stockholders. This week, we also held a "Car Home Crypto Co-Creation" delivery event with Pinnacle. Calvin Gong is our first Co-Creation Officer since we announced the “EAI + Crypto” Dual Flywheel & Dual Bridge Eco-Strategy. We look forward to creating meta-chemistry between real estate, automotive, and crypto together with industry leaders like Pinnacle. This could help us co-create greater value and enable users to share more benefits. Now going to S2-4 Product & Technology, Supply Chain, Production & Delivery: The FX Super One U.S. year-end vehicle off-line target has officially entered the final two-month sprint stage. This week, the company established a dedicated project team to coordinate and drive the work. Key areas — including engineering, supply chain, homologation, manufacturing and so on— are all accelerating across the board. On S6 Middle East: Our global teams are working across three locations in full force to prepare for the October 28th UAE Super One Product Final Launch. As the strategic third pole, the UAE will host its major Super One product launch for the first time and take the lead in initial vehicle deliveries — a milestone of great significance for FF and FX’s global strategic layout. The experience gained through this event will also help ensure the smooth progress of the upcoming vehicle off-line and final launch activities in the U.S. Going to S7, Capability and System Build-Up: This week, members of our government affairs team were invited to attend a gala in Washington D.C. that brought together political, media and entrepreneurial leaders from across the U.S. We continue to strengthen our government affairs capabilities, and they are making progress assisting the company in public sector engagement, policy incentives, tariff strategy, and more. Now let’s look at the Crypto flywheel: Following the completion of the strategic investment in Qualigen (QLGN), the Crypto team has been advancing its business operations while accelerating the transition work. The special meeting of QLGN stockholders is currently scheduled for November 2025. If the transaction is approved, QLGN is expected to be rebranded as CXC10, marking the beginning of a new chapter in Crypto and AI operations for that company. Next week, we will announce a major milestone related to the first FX Super One vehicle off-line target in the United States. Please stay tuned for the update. Okay, I'll see you later.” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

Title: The Digital Asset Treasury Playbook: How to Print, Buy and Compound to ‘Alchemise’ mNAV into a Market Engine

Time Published: 2025-10-12T20:21:00Z

About us Copy link Just a couple months ago, digital asset treasuries were crypto’s hottest trade. Spurred by soaring valuations, hundreds of companies raced to accumulate Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital assets. The mania has cooled in recent weeks. Companies that saw their stock soar after announcing multimillion-dollar crypto purchases are now trading at a discount relative to that crypto. Still, some are holding strong, with their mNAV — short for market-cap-to-net-asset-value multiple — comfortably in the black. How do the do it? In the LlamaU article below, pseudonymous DefiLlama analyst Meta explains the drivers of mNAV premiums, as well as examples where the logic behind those premiums “breaks.” (Read Meta’s previous article: What is mNAV? How to calculate and trade it? Your DefiLlama guide to the metric for digital asset treasuries) DATs are no longer just holding crypto — they’re leveraged to actively expand their own holdings and valuations. They aren’t just ‘hodl’ing tokens; it has become a competitive game of accumulation. DATs are trading their own market caps against themselves, turning investor sentiment into capital and capital into narrative fuel. This new species of equity, known as Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), sits at the intersection of corporate finance and crypto reflexivity. Their fundamentals are blockchain-based, their premiums narrative-driven, and their strategies systematic: print, buy, compound, repeat. What began as an experiment with MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation model has evolved into a broader movement spanning Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and beyond. Today, SBET, BMNR, and others have creatively applied the same reflexive mechanics to staking yield, token diversification, and capital recycling; transforming what used to be static balance sheets into market engines. mNAV = Fully Diluted Market Cap ÷ Treasury Value (USD) 1.0x → equity equals treasury value (fair) > 1.0x → investors pay a premium for leverage, yield, or access < 1.0x → the stock trades at a discount to its underlying crypto If you’re new to mNAV or want a step-by-step breakdown of how it’s calculated, “HYPE DAT Ecosystem: A Clean Case Study for mNAV” is where you want to start. A premium can be narrative-driven, structural, engineered, or yield-supported. When these align, mNAV becomes less a ratio and more a reaction: a positive feedback loop between equity and treasury that refines sentiment into capital. MicroStrategy pioneered the quintessential DAT model; they codified, refined, and evolved their procedure making them the gold standard. Below is the company’s official equity guidance slide from Exhibit 99.1 (August 2025): MSTR Equity Guidance screenshot MicroStrategy pioneered the quintessential DAT model. Its strategy slide divides valuation into mNAV zones, each dictating a different capital playbook: - Active: issue equity aggressively to buy more Bitcoin - Opportunistic: issue selectively during favorable sentiment - Tactical: issue sparingly for debt or liquidity needs - Defensive: may use credit to repurchase stock Active issuance expands Bitcoin holdings through ATMs (At-the-Market equity offering, where companies sell newly issued shares directly on to the open market), convertibles, and secondary offerings. Opportunistic issuance occurs briefly, often above 3x mNAV, allowing controlled compounding with minimal dilution. Tactical issuance covers debt or dividends without selling BTC. Defensive stance slows issuance or uses credit to repurchase shares, supporting the stock’s floor and resetting the flywheel. This structure turns capital markets into a feedback engine. When mNAV rises, MicroStrategy issues to buy BTC. When it falls, issuance tightens or reverses through buybacks. Dilution becomes reflexive compounding. The simplest catalyst for premiums or discounts is positioning versus entry cost. When a DAT’s treasury sits above its average purchase price, the market usually assigns a premium (>1x mNAV). Below cost, the market discounts it. Across the DeFiLlama Digital Asset Treasuries dashboard, profitable treasuries consistently trade higher while underwater ones remain cheap. Examples include: - MSTR (MicroStrategy) — BTC Treasury, Above Basis → Premium (mNAV ~1.5x) - KIDZ (Classover) — SOL Treasury, Above Basis → Premium (mNAV 2.1x–3.5x) - UPXI (Upexi) — SOL Treasury, Max FD lens → mNAV ~1.5x - MARA (Marathon Digital) — BTC + Infrastructure Premium (1.2x–1.7x) - NAKA (Nakamoto Holdings) — High BTC Entry → Discount (0.5x–0.8x) - BTBT (Bit Digital) — ETH Treasury w/ Yield → Premium (>1x) Premiums also form along jurisdictional and regulatory lines — where access or taxation changes valuation dynamics. Metaplanet Inc. (OTC: MTPLF, TSE: 3350.T) is Japan’s flagship Bitcoin treasury and one of the clearest cases of jurisdictional alchemy. Under Japan’s tax code, corporations must mark crypto holdings to market annually and pay tax on unrealized gains. In contrast, capital gains on listed shares are taxed separately at an effective 20.315% (Japan National Tax Agency). This makes Metaplanet (MTPLF) a tax-deferred Bitcoin proxy, letting investors gain BTC exposure through equity. By holding Bitcoin through equity rather than directly, Metaplanet turns that asymmetry into a structural advantage, maintaining a 1.8x–2.0x mNAV with it at its peak having maintained >8x mNAV for weeks on end. A textbook case of tax alchemy: turning friction into premium. DATs in regulated markets can tap capital barred from direct token exposure. MicroStrategy succeeded because it epitomized this: a compliant, levered Bitcoin wrapper for institutions. Formerly CEA Industries, BNB Network Co. (BNC) is one of the few public DATs with direct BNB exposure. With no BNB ETF or trust in the U.S., it serves as a listed proxy for Binance’s ecosystem; similar to how MSTR fulfilled the role early on as the only institutional onramp for BTC exposure. It trades near 1.87x mNAV. Given that it is publicly endorsed and heavily invested into BNB DAT by the venture capital entity YZI Labs, formerly Binance Labs, which is officially funded and partnered with Binance itself. Until a formal BNB ETF exists, that scarcity alone supports the premium. Together, Metaplanet and BNB Network Co. show the geography of premium. Where Metaplanet turns Japan’s crypto tax disadvantage into equity advantage, BNC leverages America’s regulatory bottleneck on BNB exposure. Both convert policy friction into scarcity. Metaplanet provides the purest example of geopolitical arbitrage in the DAT playbook. SBET and BMNR pioneered ETH-based treasuries that generate yield natively. By staking directly on Ethereum, both earn validator-level returns (~3–5% APY) that continuously expand NAV. That yield compounds through feedback: staking generates rewards, NAV expands, the market reprices equity upward, and higher valuations reinforce the premium. The difference lies in the ingredients: mindshare, leadership, and visibility. SBET, with Joseph Lubin, cofounder of Ethereum, and Joseph Chalom, former Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, has top tier pedigree however BMNR’s Tom Lee has a very public presence with his appearances on CNBC. This ends up likening Tom Lee to MSTR’s legendary Saylor whose loud, consistent, charismatic bullishness were undeniable variables in the success of establishing MicroStrategy as a household name. BMNR paralleled this best for the Ethereum DATS by staying on top via a combination of buybacks, retail engagement, and visible leadership. BTCS also earns ETH staking yield but trades below parity lending proof that yield alone can’t ignite the flywheel without narrative and conviction. Ultimately, yield is the base metal, and narrative, leadership, and timing are the reagents that determine whether it compounds or burns off. Some DATs diversify through moonshot allocations: small, high-beta bets meant to amplify upside or hedge decay. GameSquare (mNAV = ~1.11x) holds ETH, a CryptoPunk, and ANIME token positions. It trades slightly above parity, a modest premium for narrative diversification. BMNR allocated $20M into ORBS (formerly OCTO), a Worldcoin (WLD) DAT, at $1.46/share. By October 2025, ORBS traded above $10, a 6x gain. Clearly, these moonshots can convert asymmetric exposure into subtle mNAV leverage through optionality. Not all DATs follow the “profit = premium” or “association = value” logic. TRON (Ticker: TRON) – Despite profitable reserves and close ties to the TRON blockchain, the stock trades at a steep discount. TRON, which is the only TRX DAT treasury, trades at a 0.53x max fully diluted mNAV, Despite TRX hosting ~$77.5B in stablecoins, composed of ~98% USDT (DeFiLlama), and dominating transfers across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in the West, it’s viewed as a transactional rail, not an investable asset, keeping its mNAV deeply discounted. Contrast this with BNB Network Co. (BNC). BNB’s exchange linkage and predictable revenue burns make it behave like equity. Binance uses a share of revenue to buy and burn BNB: a deliberate, showy, aggressive mechanism versus TRX’s passive gas burns. Traditional finance investors quickly recognize the pattern as an equity-like feedback loop, sustaining BNC’s 1.87x mNAV whereas TRX’s gas burning blockchain hasn’t attracted attention to TRON treasury keeping it below parity. Simply put: BNB’s burn program mirrors corporate buybacks, while TRX’s gas burns are passive and minor in comparison. BNC maintains premium; TRON does not. In numerical terms, the contrast between the two when examining max mNAV is astronomical: a difference of over 300%! BTCS, one of the first ETH staking firms, trades around 0.88x mNAV. SBET and BMNR captured attention with clear messaging and buybacks; BTCS remained quieter, focused on infrastructure over narrative. It delivers on-chain results but lacks social reflexivity; proof that legitimacy without visibility still prices like a discount. These cases show DAT premiums are behavioral, not mechanical. Narrative clarity, investor access, and perceived intentionality decide whether association becomes valuation. TRX dominates usage but not mindshare translating to a discount for TRON; BNB’s engineered burn loop mirrors equity translating to a premium for BNC as if accounting for revenue generation; and BTCS shows substance alone isn’t enough. In this market, numbers matter but narratives are the driver for positive multiples. In the DAT ecosystem, premiums aren’t random; they’re engineered. Every successful treasury blends fundamentals, narrative, and structure into a reflexive loop: fundamentals anchor value, narrative amplifies it, and capital strategy turns that feedback into growth. MicroStrategy utilizes financial wizardry to convert sentiment into Bitcoin. Metaplanet and BNC alchemize geography into premium through geopolitical arbitrage. BMNR, SBET, and GAME merge yield and narrative momentum. TRON and BTCS remind us that usage without story rarely sustains a premium. In this financial alchemy, fundamentals are the lead, narrative is the spark, and regulation is the catalyst that determines how brightly it burns.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.5 trillion market cap company. The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI. Nvidia has participated in 50 venture capital deals so far in 2025, already surpassing the 48 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 21 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round. This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to The New York Times invested $1.3 billion. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the chipmaker announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in the company over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September. Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Nscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project. Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees. Commonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August 2025. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in November 2024, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Cohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise LLM provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. CoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Firmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received an AU$330 million (approximately $215 million) in funding at an AU$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient “AI factory” in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining. Sakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Nuro: In August, Nvidia participated in the $203 million funding round for the self-driving startup focused on delivery. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Weka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway’s $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in since 2023. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Reka AI: In July, AI research lab Reka raised $110 million in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia. The deal tripled the startup’s valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg. Update: The post has been updated to reflect that Nvidia is one of several meaningful investors in Reflection AI. This post was first published in January 2025.

Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Weka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway’s $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in since 2023. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Reka AI: In July, AI research lab Reka raised $110 million in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia. The deal tripled the startup’s valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg.

Title: Are US stocks overvalued? What investors should know about the rally

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. One company is more valuable than all the listed companies in Canada, or the UK, or Germany, writes Mark Lister. THE FACTS It’s been a fantastic run for the United States sharemarket. The S&P 500 index is up 18% in the past 12 months, and 83% over three years. Even Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has commented on this, noting that “equity prices are fairly highly valued” during a recent speech. To be fair, he was responding to a question, rather than feeling the need to proactively offer an opinion. For the record, I don’t believe US stocks are in a bubble. I do, however, agree they’re looking pricey. That means investors need to tread carefully, and think a little harder about how they spread their exposures. Valuations for the US market are at the highest levels we’ve seen in some time. The widely used price/earnings (PE) ratio is 22.8, well above the average since 1990 of 16.6 and the 18.7 average of the last decade. The only time it’s been higher was in the late 1990s, in the days that preceded the dotcom boom and bust. Things are eerily similar today, with the market strength being driven largely by companies associated with AI trends. The big three – Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple – together make up more than one-fifth of the S&P 500. Last month Deutsche Bank produced a fascinating chart to really put this into perspective. It showed how Nvidia’s market value had surpassed the total value of every country in the world’s entire listed stock exchange apart from the US, China, Japan and India. Let that sink in. One company is more valuable than all the listed companies in Canada, or the UK, or Germany. The US market is more concentrated than we’ve seen in decades and while that’s a risk, it also makes those PE comparisons less useful. The tech behemoths of 2025 have increasingly dominant positions, high margins and very profitable business models. Can you really compare them with the biggest companies of 20 years ago? In 2005 Exxon Mobil was the largest stock on the market, while Citigroup, General Electric and Walmart were in the top five. The earnings power of this class of 2025 is hugely exciting, if you’re a believer in the productivity growth potential of AI. It can’t be overstated how important this is, because it’s earnings growth that ultimately drives share prices (at least in the longer term). Earnings for the US tech sector grew 23% in the June quarter, relative to a year ago. The communication services sector (where the likes of Meta and Alphabet reside) saw an even larger gain of 46%. Looking ahead to 2026, analysts are projecting earnings growth for the S&P 500 index of almost 14%, double the long-term average of about 7%. The so-called Magnificent 7 are expected to contribute as much as two-thirds of this. Even if the earnings tailwinds can justify the higher valuations and keep pushing the US market higher, there’s a strong case for diversification right now. Other sharemarkets look more reasonable when we compare current valuations to long-term averages. The UK and Europe are trading in line with history, emerging market shares are only slightly higher, while Japan looks cheaper. Even within the US itself, there are sectors which have lagged and look better value. Healthcare, energy and real estate are trading in line with their longer-term average PE, while utilities and consumer staples are only at a modest premium. Each of those regions and sectors will be facing its own unique backdrop, and valuation alone isn’t an indicator of where prices will go in the next year or two. However, for investors feeling uneasy about the ongoing strength of American equities, there are plenty of ways to hedge your bets. Valuations across the US sharemarket are indeed high, but it could keep performing well if the economy remains resilient, the Fed keeps reducing interest rates and the tech sector keeps delivering solid earnings. At the same time, it would be unwise to ignore the risk things are a little overdone. The astute investor is probably ensuring they have an exposure to markets outside the US, while maintaining a healthy foothold in the world’s biggest economy.

Title: 5 High Yield CEFs With Steep Discounts Right Now
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/10/12/5-high-yield-cefs-with-steep-discounts-right-now/

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Closed-end funds (CEFs) are the last bargains left on the board. CEFs are often confused with mutual funds and ETFs, but they are different because they often trade at discounts to their net asset values (NAVs). For contrarians like us looking for deals, this is key. CEF trading is relatively thin. This created inefficiencies, such as select CEFs trading for as cheap as 95 or even 90 cents on the dollar. Plus, some of them dish big dividends—like these five. Let’s start with the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Dividend Income Fund (EVT)—a CEF that buys not just common stocks, but also preferred stocks, that distribute qualified dividends. Qualified dividends are taxed at the more favorable long-term capital gains tax rates; non-qualified dividends, like those paid by most real estate investment trusts (REITs), face less favorable short-term capital gains rates. EVT’s four managers currently hold an 80/20 blend of common and preferred stocks, with the traditional equity “sleeve” made up of about 80 predominantly large-cap stocks. Names like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and NextEra Energy (NEE) would be right at home in a bog-standard dividend fund. But while that fund would likely pay 2% or so, EVT delivers 4x that number, at 8% currently. (And it’s a monthly dividend payer, no less.) Part of that high yield we can chalk up to leverage—management borrows additional funds to invest even more money in their picks, which amplifies yields and gains if we’re fortunate, and amplifies losses if we’re not. Leverage currently sits at about 20% of assets. But the other part of it is the nature of those distributions. When Eaton Vance’s fund sends out a monthly distribution, dividend income is only a (small) portion of that. The rest is capital gains, usually of the long-term variety. It’s a “managed” distribution, too—the typical dividend fund’s income will vary from one period to the next, but EVT’s monthly payout hasn’t changed since April 2024, when the CEF raised its distribution by about 11%. The strategy doesn’t give us much of an edge over basic dividend funds, however—at least not longer-term. Right now, valuation is on EVT’s side, as the fund trades at a roughly 8% discount to NAV that’s wider than its longer-term 5% average. Options strategies are popular in CEFLand. Sometimes they’re complementary to the primary strategy, but sometimes they’re the whole point. The latter is the case with the Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Opportunities (ETV). It holds a portfolio of 150, mostly large-cap stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), then sells covered calls on a few major market indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to generate income, which it distributes to its shareholders monthly. Funds that sell covered calls—especially those where the strategy revolves around it—are designed to limit downside and provide income. On that front, actively managed covered-call strategies like ETV are better than comparable plain-vanilla index ETFs. Better still? We can sometimes buy that protection on the cheap; while ETV tends to trade on par with its NAV, we can buy the fund and its monthly distributions at 94 cents on the dollar. BlackRock Enhanced Global Dividend Trust (BOE) is like a mix of ETV and EVT, with global exposure (read: U.S. and international stocks) mixed in. Management has built a roughly 50-stock portfolio that’s currently split 65/35 across U.S. and international stocks, but that blend can and will change over time. When I’ve looked at this fund in past years, I’ve seen it hold as much as half of assets in international stocks, which is higher than the typical global fund. But like ETV and EVT, everything revolves around blue chips. It holds U.S. mega-caps like Microsoft and Broadcom (AVGO), but also developed-market names like AstraZeneca (AZN) and even emerging-market giants like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Alibaba (BABA). International stocks might pay more than domestics, but BOE still yields roughly 3x more than most global ETFs. It’s not leverage, which is vanishingly thin, but a covered call strategy—one that helps fund a monthly distribution north of 8%. We’re not expecting to outperform a basic index over time, but we do expect less volatility and smaller drawdowns. An 8.7% discount to NAV would seem to give us an edge right now, but it’s a shallower markdown than its longer-term 11% average. Many sector ETFs and mutual funds are usually faithful to one slice of the market. We buy technology funds for technology stocks, and bank funds for bank stocks. But CEFs like the BlackRock Resources & Commodities Strategy Trust (BCX) aren’t afraid to “cross the streams.” BCX primarily invests in stocks “issued by commodity or natural resources companies,” meaning that the portfolio straddles the energy and materials sectors. The management team has assembled a tight portfolio of just 45 companies including integrated energy majors like Shell (SHEL) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), but also metals and minerals specialists like Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM) and Freeport McMoRan (FCX). The fund also may invest in derivatives, and it also sells covered calls to enhance its dividend yield. The result? It’s not always that way. Longer-term, BCX has struggled to capture some of the biggest moves in metals, at least in part because of its covered-call strategy. Like with many CEFs, the best chance for success is buying while the fund is cheap. We can currently buy BlackRock’s fund for a 6% discount, but it’s not really a deal compared to its long-term average discount of 10%. We get a more targeted energy play (and the highest yield of the bunch, at nearly 10%) from the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund (EMO). Co-Managers Peter Vanderlee and Patrick McElroy own just 20 companies. But it’s a who’s who of midstream companies (firms that operate pipelines, storage, terminals and other energy assets), including regular stocks such as Targa Resources (TRGP) and ONEOK (OKE), as well as master limited partnerships (MLPs) such as Energy Transfer LP (ET) and Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD). Unlike with the other CEFs mentioned above, EMO’s holdings do a lot of the talking as it pertains to the monthly distribution. MLPs are among some of the highest-yielding securities in the stock market. But the fund still pays more than most MLP ETFs thanks to high leverage of nearly 30%. EMO trails its benchmark, the Alerian MLP Index—represented in the chart below by the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP)—by 30 percentage points since inception in 2011. But since 2023 EMO has nearly doubled the return of AMLP, thanks to its aggressive leverage. EMO has the deepest discount on this list—we currently can buy shares at 91 cents on the dollar. But thanks to its hot performance, it’s actually expensive in historical terms, trading well above its longer-term 15% average discount.

After Friday’s big selloff as President Trump fired back at China’s tightening of rare earths export curbs with higher tariffs, investors will be watching closely for the latest trade policy developments. An ongoing federal government shutdown may delay the release of several economic reports, but investors can look forward to a full slate of corporate earnings from big banks and mainstays in the semiconductor industry. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and American Express are on the list of major financial firms set to report this week, while reports from TSMC, Johnson & Johnson, and United Airlines will also be in focus. Without a resolution to the budget dispute, the government shutdown will enter its third week, likely delaying the release of data on wholesale inflation, retail sales, housing starts, and jobless claims. Homebuilder confidence and small business optimism surveys are still scheduled, and several Federal Reserve speakers are expected to deliver remarks, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The bond market is closed on Monday for the Columbus Day holiday (observed in some places as Indigenous Peoples Day), while major stock exchanges are open. The Federal Reserve system, major financial institutions, and many federal, state, and local government offices will be closed on Monday. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. This week is set to bring third-quarter updates from some of the world's biggest banks and top financial institutions, starting with Tuesday's release from JPMorgan Chase. The world’s largest bank by market capitalization has reported better-than-expected revenue in the year’s first two quarters, even as sales declined and net interest income came up short in its most recent report amid CEO Jamie Dimon’s warnings about "turbulence" in the economy. Others expected to release quarterly financials Tuesday include Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and CitiGroup. Reports from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are due to follow Wednesday, while Charles Schwab, Bank of New York Mellon, and U.S. Bancorp are scheduled for Thursday. Earnings from American Express, Truist Financial, and State Street are slated for Friday. The world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC, is set to report its results Thursday, after growing its revenue by 40% in the first half of 2025 on strong sales of AI chips. Chipmaking equipment maker ASML looks to report Wednesday after the Dutch firm raised worries about future growth amid tariff pressures. Also this week, cloud computing giant Oracle will host a three-day AI World conference beginning on Monday, and customer relationship management software firm Salesforce's Dreamforce event starts Tuesday. With the federal government shutdown heading into its third week, the blackout on economic data releases is likely to continue. The Thursday reports on U.S. retail sales and initial jobless claims and Friday’s update on housing starts could be delayed by the shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said last week it plans to release on Oct. 24 the Consumer Price Index inflation report for September that was originally scheduled for release on Wednesday. Several Federal Reserve officials are also scheduled to speak, coming as the central bank is set to release its Beige Book economic update on Wednesday. Chair Jerome Powell is due to give an economic update on Tuesday, with remarks also expected this week from Fed Governor Stephen Miran, Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman and Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Some data releases are still expected, including a survey of small business optimism on Tuesday and report on homebuilder confidence on Thursday.

After Friday’s big selloff as President Trump fired back at China’s tightening of rare earths export curbs with higher tariffs, investors will be watching closely for the latest trade policy developments. An ongoing federal government shutdown may delay the release of several economic reports, but investors can look forward to a full slate of corporate earnings from big banks and mainstays in the semiconductor industry. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and American Express are on the list of major financial firms set to report this week, while reports from TSMC, Johnson & Johnson, and United Airlines will also be in focus. Without a resolution to the budget dispute, the government shutdown will enter its third week, likely delaying the release of data on wholesale inflation, retail sales, housing starts, and jobless claims. Homebuilder confidence and small business optimism surveys are still scheduled, and several Federal Reserve speakers are expected to deliver remarks, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The bond market is closed on Monday for the Columbus Day holiday (observed in some places as Indigenous Peoples Day), while major stock exchanges are open. The Federal Reserve system, major financial institutions, and many federal, state, and local government offices will be closed on Monday. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. This week is set to bring third-quarter updates from some of the world's biggest banks and top financial institutions, starting with Tuesday's release from JPMorgan Chase. The world’s largest bank by market capitalization has reported better-than-expected revenue in the year’s first two quarters, even as sales declined and net interest income came up short in its most recent report amid CEO Jamie Dimon’s warnings about "turbulence" in the economy. Others expected to release quarterly financials Tuesday include Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and CitiGroup. Reports from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are due to follow Wednesday, while Charles Schwab, Bank of New York Mellon, and U.S. Bancorp are scheduled for Thursday. Earnings from American Express, Truist Financial, and State Street are slated for Friday. The world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC, is set to report its results Thursday, after growing its revenue by 40% in the first half of 2025 on strong sales of AI chips. Chipmaking equipment maker ASML looks to report Wednesday after the Dutch firm raised worries about future growth amid tariff pressures. Also this week, cloud computing giant Oracle will host a three-day AI World conference beginning on Monday, and customer relationship management software firm Salesforce's Dreamforce event starts Tuesday.

Title: I was laid off by Microsoft and can't find a job. I'm weeks away from giving up my apartment and moving across the country to live with family.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ian Carter, a 33-year-old job seeker in Redmond, Washington, who previously worked as a technical program manager at Microsoft. It has been edited for length and clarity. On May 13, I was getting lunch at a Panera Bread when I just happened to check my email. When I read it, it felt like a gut punch. I'd been laid off from my Microsoft job. My mind started racing. Could I have done something different? Could I have been better? However, I eventually realized it was simply a business decision. I'd seen the company lay off a lot of people in recent years, and it felt like it didn't matter if you were a great worker or not — everybody was at risk. When I was laid off, I was on medical leave for a personal health issue and had been planning to return to work in the coming days. I collected my last paycheck in mid-July and then received some severance pay, but I started applying for jobs almost immediately. My mindset was "I can cry while I apply." I decided to share that I'd been laid off on LinkedIn, and the post received over 115,000 impressions. I began receiving messages from recruiters about opportunities, and I've landed interviews at companies that include Disney and Nintendo. But it's now been five months since my layoff, and I'm still looking for a job. I've been drawing on my savings to pay the bills and renting my one-bedroom apartment on a month-to-month lease for about $2,700 — all while crossing my fingers that I land a role soon. My lease ends the week of October 20, and if I don't have a job offer by then, I'm planning to move across the country to Florida to live with my family and save money until I find a job. Rent is expensive, but rent without income coming in is doubly expensive. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: If I had to guess why I, along with many others at Microsoft and other Big Tech companies, have been laid off in recent years, I'd point to two factors: overhiring during the pandemic and massive investments in AI. Whatever the reason, it's clear that finding a job in tech has become significantly more difficult. Before my layoff, I regularly heard from college students struggling to break into the industry. The market already seemed tougher than when I graduated — and now, I'm seeing that firsthand. I'm in a spot where I have nearly four years of full-time experience — not quite a new grad, but not senior level, either. I think some companies are looking for one or the other, which has made my search harder. Others are seeking very specific skill sets, while mine can sometimes be viewed as more generalist. As I've searched for work, I've been trying to develop my AI skills, as job postings suggest that companies are increasingly valuing this expertise. Working at Microsoft also gave me insight into the value of AI skills. During my last year, I didn't personally feel that my performance expectations had risen too much, but I did feel some pressure to find ways to incorporate AI into my work. During my job search, I've tried to replicate the strategies that got me to this point in my career. I dropped out of high school in 2009 for health-related reasons, but I eventually earned my GED and enrolled at a community college, where I earned my associate degree and then went on to attend Florida State University. During this period, I built my network on LinkedIn — I now have more than 8,700 followers — which helped me secure interviews and ultimately land an internship at Salesforce. A company recruiter reached out to me, which is how I learned about the role and landed an interview. Having the internship on my résumé helped me land full-time interviews after graduation. I had a list of dream companies — including Microsoft, Amazon, and Netflix — and I applied to a program manager role at Microsoft without a referral. After an interview, I eventually received a job offer. In 2021, I graduated from Florida State with a bachelor's degree in computer science and began working remotely for Microsoft due to the pandemic. In 2022, I moved to Redmond, Washington — where the company is headquartered — and before I was laid off, I had a six-figure salary. As I've searched for work — targeting program manager, project manager, and product management roles — I've tried to rely on my existing network and make new connections. When I see a role that interests me, I reach out to the recruiter or someone with a similar job title at the company and ask what they think their company is looking for in a candidate. I then tailor my résumé accordingly. Since I have a LinkedIn Premium account, I have more visibility into who views my profile. If they have an interesting job title, I'll send them a message. Most of the time, they respond because they recall visiting my page, which leads to a conversation. When I connect with people, I usually ask for advice rather than a referral. But if someone offers to give me one, I gladly accept. While these connections have helped me land some interviews, I'm still looking for a job offer. Going forward, my plan is to continue doing what I'm doing — applying for jobs, networking as much as possible, and developing my AI skills. However, if my job search drags on, I might consider pursuing a graduate degree, such as an MBA or a degree related to AI. In addition to networking for job opportunities, I've also reached out to others who've been laid off to discuss our shared experiences. Layoffs take a mental toll, and it's nice to talk to people who can relate. I sometimes visit the private "MSFT Survivors" Facebook group, which includes people who've been laid off throughout the company's history. It's always interesting to read about what others are going through and their stories. It makes me feel like I'm not alone. Your daily guide to what's moving markets — straight to your inbox.

Title: Let’s give the ‘fired’ label a rest
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/11/why-its-time-move-on-from-the-word-fired-restructuring-layoffs/
Time Published: 2025-10-11T13:10:00Z
Full Content:
Here are some eye-opening numbers: Last year, nearly 20 million Americans got pink slips. By June of this year, 10 million employees had been dismissed from a range of industries and companies, including blue-chip tech firms like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, as well as once secure federal agencies. A whopping 1.6 million workers are laid off each month. Losing your job is a perpetually looming threat: 40% of American workers report being terminated at least once in their careers; most of them were taken by surprise. Those numbers are just as bad — and often worse — for those at the top. Recruiters tell us an estimated 40%-60% of senior executives are forced out, in part due to today’s record high turnover of CEOs. Regardless of title or income, the same label is applied (and self-applied) to people who’ve lost their jobs: You’ve been “fired.” Words matter. And the word “fired” implies fault — your fault. While some employees are let go for performance or behavior, millions more are caught in restructurings, downsizings, and strategic shifts spurred by investor and marketplace pressures. This cuts across corporate America, whether you’re on the shop floor, in middle management, or in the C-suite. No one is immune. We live in a churn economy of routine mass layoffs and restructurings that didn’t plague the generations of workers who retired before the 1980s. Leanne’s parents collectively spent over 40 years at Boeing; Nina’s father spent 30 years at Hughes Aircraft. Our parents’ generation could count on stability, security, predictability — and profound corporate loyalty that cut both ways. One study found that 58% of Fortune 100 companies announced layoffs in 2023, while in 1979 only 5% did. Back then, being “fired” was shorthand for showing unproductive, ill-fitting, or unethical workers the door — preferably before they stole the stapler. There are still plenty of employees who earned their pink slip fair and square. Performance and integrity issues? That’s on them. We shouldn’t shy away from holding employees accountable. But in today’s turbulent economy, the vast majority of displaced workers aren’t fired because of personal failure. More than ever before in modern times, people’s careers are fragile, unpredictable, and subject to pressures beyond their control. The personal toll of job loss is enormous. We’ve been fortunate to work with some of the most exceptionally talented and visionary business leaders around. And even among these super achievers, a job loss shakes confidence and self-worth, threatening to erase in their own minds years of well-earned impact and success. “Executives know the exit isn’t really about them,” says executive coach Nicole Didda. “They’ve got the performance, the reviews, the credibility. Still, the word ‘fired’ hits hard. Especially for women, it undermines confidence, making them feel ‘less than’ even when they know better.” That damaging psychic weight of insecurity and self-blame seeps into our society and politics, where polls show a stubborn and longtime trend of declining faith in a better future. No wonder, when 81% of workers in 2025 fear job loss. With an unsettling sense that control has slipped away, there’s a tendency for even the most talented and accomplished employees to self-identify as “fired” — even when the cause of their dismissal is a slowdown in the market. Poking fun at oneself for being let go may build connection, but it also undermines confidence, credibility, and faith in a better future. These economic forces aren’t going to change, especially with AI bringing its own uncertainty and job disruption. All the more reason we need to reframe the narrative around job loss. If almost half the workforce has experienced a job elimination, shouldn’t we give the word “fired” a rest? Let’s be more thoughtful — and understanding — in the way we treat our colleagues (and ourselves) when describing workplace departures. Let’s replace “fired” with something like: “freed for what’s next.” Let’s make the increasingly frequent business of moving on less dramatic, and a whole lot more human.

Title: Why International Stocks Are Surging And What US Investors Should Know
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/10/11/why-international-stocks-are-surging-and-what-us-investors-should-know/

ByBill Stone, Contributor. In aggregate, American business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so. – Warren Buffett After several years of underperformance, international stocks are outperforming the US, igniting a discussion about whether investors should increase their exposure to foreign stocks. A broad measure of international stock performance is the MSCI ACWI, excluding the US, which has a total return of 26.7% year-to-date through the third quarter. The MSCI ACWI index includes both developed and emerging markets. In comparison, the US’s S&P 500 has risen 14.8%. The MSCI EAFE is a subset of developed international markets, while the MSCI EM covers the stock markets of emerging countries. While past performance is not necessarily an indicator of future returns, investors in international stocks have been quite disappointed relative to US-centric investors over the past five, ten, and twenty years. Over the past twenty years, the S&P 500 has achieved a total return of 700.6%, significantly outperforming the 233.3% return from broad international markets. More about this later, but one of the major drivers for US stocks was the tremendous performance of the US technology sector, which soared by 2,053.8% over the last twenty years. An additional variable for US-based investors owning international stocks is the impact of foreign currencies. US investors experience higher returns from their international holdings when the US dollar depreciates relative to the foreign currency of the international stocks they own. Given the weakness of the US dollar relative to many currencies this year, this has juiced the returns of foreign stocks. In fact, the year-to-date move in currencies provided 9.3 percentage points of the 11.9 percentage points of outperformance of the MSCI ACWI Ex-US over the S&P 500. The year-to-date boost to international investments is unlikely to be repeated if history is any guide. In fact, foreign exchange has reduced the returns of US-based investors in foreign stocks over the past twenty years. Even the emerging market stock index that benefited the most from currency tailwinds only gained 68.7% over twenty years, due to foreign currency exposure, which equates to a 3% annualized gain resulting from currency translation. Despite the currency help, the S&P 500 outpaced emerging markets stocks by a wide margin. While some might extoll the virtues of currency diversification, most US investors have their liabilities almost exclusively in US dollars. Thus, an extensive currency mismatch between assets and liabilities should be viewed as a risk, not a positive attribute. Diversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing. – Warren Buffett Many academics and some practitioners argue that US investors suffer from a home country bias, as they do not own a sufficient number of international stocks to aid in diversification. They consider a market capitalization-weighted allocation to be a proper baseline, which suggests that US stocks should comprise 49% of a stock portfolio, according to their calculations. Beyond ignoring the foreign exchange risk, this argument overlooks the reality that the US occupies a privileged position relative to most countries. The US benefits from an embrace of capitalism and the rule of law. Furthermore, our markets are already fully diversified across sectors, which is not the case for all countries. Because many of our US companies are global leaders and competitors, over 40% of the revenues for the S&P 500 are sourced internationally, allowing investors to gain international exposure by holding large-cap US stocks. Another lens to consider is that an allocation to international indexes is a bet against technology. The S&P 500 is 35% technology, while the foreign markets' tech weighting is 14%. Instead, the international markets have a significantly higher exposure to financial companies and banks than the US. It is fair to argue that focusing solely on the technology sector overlooks the actual impact of technology leaders in the US. Adding Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Alphabet (GOOGL) to the mix increases the technology-related US exposure to 46%. The US is fortunate to be home to many of the world's leading technology companies. While it can be debated whether technology is where you want to be overweight at the moment, those considering international index investing should be aware of the inherent wager in making that move. Another argument used by some advocates for international investing is that valuations are cheaper than in the US. The forward estimated price-to-earnings ratio is 14.7 times for international stocks versus the US's 22.1 times. While the valuation is lower, US stocks should trade at a higher valuation due to a superior return on equity, which measures the earnings that a company produces from the capital provided by shareholders. US companies also have superior profit margins, which is the percentage of revenue that ends up as bottom-line profits. The US technology sector is a crucial reason why the S&P 500 boasts exceptional profitability. There can be reasonable disagreements about the size of the valuation premium appropriate for US stocks. Still, the mere fact that international stocks as a whole are cheaper is necessary but not sufficient to argue for sustained outperformance from them. The five very successfully operate in a manner somewhat similar to Berkshire itself. – Warren Buffett referring to Berkshire Hathaway’s investment in the Japanese trading companies. Although the US has a large share, there are well-managed and dominant companies domiciled outside the country. Rather than a predetermined percentage allocation of a stock portfolio with international stocks, investors should seek specific opportunities worldwide, while being mindful of the additional risks associated with foreign currencies and particular locales. Even though he primarily invests in US securities, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) can provide a good example. Berkshire Hathaway initially announced the acquisition of about 5% of five Japanese trading companies at the end of August 2020. These holdings are Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co. Ltd., and Sumitomo Corp. In Buffett's 2024 annual letter, he noted that all five companies had agreed to relax the previously agreed-upon 10% ownership ceiling. At the recent annual meeting, Buffett said he "won't give a thought" to selling them and expects Berkshire to own them for fifty years or more. Berkshire now owns around 10% of each of these trading companies. Interestingly, Buffett mitigated the foreign exchange risk associated with these companies being traded in Japanese Yen by having Berkshire Hathaway issue Yen-denominated bonds, thereby better currency-matching assets and liabilities. While individual investors can't issue foreign-currency-denominated bonds, currency-hedged investments are available to mitigate currency risk. For example, WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity ETF (DXJ) provides exposure to dividend-paying Japanese stocks, currently including most of Buffett's Japanese trading houses, while hedging the currency to remove as much of the Yen-currency risk as possible. Alternatively, a non-currency-hedged individual foreign stock position can be perfectly reasonable if it presents an attractive opportunity, even when considering the currency, political, legal, and regulatory risks of the country.

The alarm clock reads 3:47 AM when Margaret checks her phone for the third time tonight. The headlines are relentless: inflation stubbornly above 4%, geopolitical tensions escalating, and her retirement account balance fluctuating wildly with each market session. At 58, she’s watching decades of careful savings slowly erode, not from market crashes, but from something far more insidious—the silent theft of currency debasement. Margaret’s story is the same across millions of American households in 2025. While the stock market reaches new nominal highs, the purchasing power of the dollar continues its relentless decline. A gallon of milk that cost $3.50 five years ago now costs over $5.00. The house she bought for $200,000 in 2010 is now “worth” $400,000, but the dollars she would receive are worth significantly less than the dollars she originally spent. This is the reality of living in a fiat currency system where central banks can create money at will, and governments can spend without meaningful constraints. However, throughout this monetary chaos, two assets have maintained their purchasing power for over 5,000 years: gold and silver. These precious metals represent more than mere investments—they are sound money, the ultimate hedge against the systematic debasement of paper currencies. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore why buying physical gold and silver has become not just prudent, but essential for wealth preservation in 2025. We will examine the fundamental differences between owning physical metals versus paper proxies, provide a step-by-step guide for secure purchasing, and explain why working with a trusted dealer like Miles Franklin Precious Metals can make the difference between success and costly mistakes in your precious metals journey. The concept of currency debasement is as old as money itself, but the modern version operates with unprecedented scale and sophistication. When the Federal Reserve creates new dollars through quantitative easing or when Congress authorizes massive spending programs, they are effectively diluting the value of every existing dollar in circulation. This process transfers wealth from savers to debtors, from the prudent to the profligate, and from the middle class to those who receive the newly created money first. Since the abandonment of the gold standard in 1971, the U.S. dollar has lost over 85% of its purchasing power [1]. What could be purchased for $1 in 1971 now requires approximately $6.50 in today’s debased currency. This represents the largest wealth transfer in human history, conducted not through taxation or confiscation, but through the subtle manipulation of the monetary system itself. The acceleration of this process in recent years has been breathtaking. The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet expanded from less than $1 trillion in 2008 to over $9 trillion at its peak in 2021 [2]. While some of this expansion has been reversed, the precedent has been established: when faced with economic challenges, central banks will create money rather than allow natural market corrections to occur. Inflation, the visible manifestation of currency debasement, has returned with a vengeance in 2025. Despite official statistics suggesting inflation is “under control,” anyone who purchases food, energy, or housing knows the reality is far different. The Consumer Price Index, heavily manipulated through hedonic adjustments and substitution effects, significantly understates the true rate of price increases experienced by ordinary Americans. This environment creates an urgent need for inflation hedges—assets that maintain or increase their value as the purchasing power of currency declines. While stocks, bonds, and real estate can provide some protection, they all exist within the same financial system that creates the problem. Only physical gold and silver offer complete independence from the monetary system that is systematically destroying the value of paper assets. Gold has demonstrated its effectiveness as an inflation hedge throughout history. During the inflationary 1970s, gold rose from $35 per ounce to over $800, providing investors with returns that far exceeded the rate of currency debasement. In the current environment, with gold trading above $3,950 per ounce, the metal continues to fulfill its historical role as the ultimate store of value. The decision between gold and silver investment represents one of the most important choices facing precious metals investors. While both metals serve as monetary assets and inflation hedges, they possess distinct characteristics that make them suitable for different investment objectives and risk tolerances. Gold serves as the ultimate monetary metal, recognized and accepted worldwide as a store of value. Central banks hold gold as their primary reserve asset, with 43% of central banks planning to increase their gold reserves in 2025 [3]. This institutional demand provides a floor under gold prices and ensures continued recognition of gold’s monetary role. The investment case for gold rests on its unparalleled track record as a wealth preservation tool. Gold does not corrode, tarnish, or decay. It cannot be created or destroyed through human action. These physical properties, combined with its historical role as money, make gold the ultimate insurance policy against monetary system failure. Silver offers a more complex investment proposition, serving dual roles as both a monetary metal and an essential industrial commodity. The industrial demand for silver has exploded in recent years, driven by the green energy transition, electric vehicle production, and advanced electronics manufacturing. Solar panels alone consume over 100 million ounces of silver annually, and this demand is projected to double by 2030 [4]. The gold-to-silver ratio, currently trading around 81:1, provides insight into silver’s relative value. Historically, this ratio has averaged approximately 16:1, suggesting that silver may be significantly undervalued relative to gold. When this ratio contracts during precious metals bull markets, silver typically outperforms gold by substantial margins. Silver’s lower price per ounce makes it accessible to investors with smaller budgets, allowing for more flexible purchasing strategies. A single ounce of silver costs less than $50, compared to nearly $4,000 for an ounce of gold. This affordability enables investors to make regular, small purchases through dollar-cost averaging strategies. However, silver’s industrial demand also creates additional volatility. Economic recessions can reduce industrial consumption, putting downward pressure on silver prices even as monetary demand increases. Conversely, supply disruptions or technological breakthroughs can create explosive upward price movements that far exceed gold’s performance. For most investors, a balanced approach incorporating both metals provides optimal diversification. A typical allocation might include 70-80% gold for stability and wealth preservation, with 20-30% silver for growth potential and industrial exposure. This combination captures the benefits of both metals while managing the unique risks associated with each. The distinction between physical vs. paper gold represents perhaps the most critical decision facing precious metals investors. While paper alternatives like ETFs, futures contracts, and mining stocks offer convenience and liquidity, they introduce counterparty risks and systemic vulnerabilities that can prove devastating during the very crises that precious metals are meant to protect against. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) like GLD and SLV provide easy exposure to precious metals prices through traditional brokerage accounts. However, these funds hold metal on behalf of shareholders, creating a layer of intermediation between the investor and the actual asset. During periods of extreme market stress, ETF shares may trade at significant discounts to their underlying metal value, and redemption mechanisms may fail to function properly. More concerning is the practice of fractional reserve precious metals, where multiple claims exist against the same physical metal. The London Bullion Market Association estimates that paper claims against physical gold exceed actual metal availability by ratios of 100:1 or higher [5]. In a crisis scenario where multiple investors simultaneously demand physical delivery, the system would collapse, leaving paper holders with worthless claims. Futures contracts and other derivatives create even greater risks, as they are settled primarily in cash rather than physical metal. These instruments serve the financial system’s need for price discovery and speculation but provide no protection against monetary system failure. During the 2008 financial crisis, numerous commodity funds collapsed despite rising underlying asset prices, demonstrating the dangers of derivative-based exposure. Physical bullion ownership eliminates these counterparty risks entirely. When you hold physical gold or silver, you possess direct ownership of a tangible asset that exists independently of the financial system. No bank failure, brokerage collapse, or government decree can eliminate your ownership of physical metal stored securely under your control. The peace of mind that comes with physical ownership cannot be quantified in financial terms. During the 2008 financial crisis, investors with physical precious metals slept soundly while those holding paper proxies worried about the solvency of their counterparties. This psychological benefit alone justifies the additional costs and complexities associated with physical ownership. Storage and insurance costs represent the primary disadvantages of physical ownership, typically ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% annually depending on the storage method chosen. However, these costs pale in comparison to the potential losses from counterparty failure or the inability to access your metals during a crisis. The famous phrase “if you don’t hold it, you don’t own it” has become a rallying cry among precious metals investors for good reason. History is littered with examples of paper claims becoming worthless while physical assets retained their value. The choice between physical and paper precious metals is ultimately a choice between true ownership and convenient exposure—a choice that may determine your financial survival during the next monetary crisis. Purchasing physical precious metals requires careful planning and attention to detail. Unlike buying stocks or bonds through a brokerage account, acquiring physical gold and silver involves considerations of authenticity, storage, insurance, and dealer selection that can significantly impact your investment success. The precious metals industry includes dealers ranging from highly reputable, long-established firms to fly-by-night operations that prey on inexperienced investors. The difference between working with a trusted dealer and falling victim to a scam can mean the difference between successful wealth preservation and devastating financial loss. Miles Franklin Precious Metals exemplifies the gold standard in precious metals dealing. Founded in 1989 by David and Andy Schectman, this family-owned business has built an impeccable reputation over more than three decades in the industry. With over $12 billion in precious metals sales and an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau with zero complaints on record, Miles Franklin has earned the trust of investors nationwide [6]. What sets Miles Franklin apart from competitors is their commitment to education and personalized service. Rather than employing high-pressure sales tactics, their experienced brokers take time to understand each client’s unique situation and investment objectives. This consultative approach ensures that investors make informed decisions aligned with their long-term financial goals. The company’s extensive product selection includes investment-grade gold and silver bullion, numismatic coins, and specialty items from major mints worldwide. Their relationships with primary distributors ensure competitive pricing and reliable product availability, even during periods of high demand when other dealers may experience shortages. “In an industry where trust is paramount, partnering with a dealer like Miles Franklin Precious Metals ensures you are getting authentic products at fair prices, with expert guidance to support your precious metals journey.” The choice between coins and bars represents a fundamental decision that affects liquidity, recognizability, premiums, and storage considerations. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each format enables investors to make informed decisions based on their specific needs and circumstances. Government-minted coins like American Gold Eagles, Canadian Gold Maples, and Austrian Philharmonics offer several advantages for precious metals investors. These coins are produced by sovereign mints with guaranteed purity and weight, making them instantly recognizable and highly liquid worldwide. The government backing provides additional assurance of authenticity and quality. The premium over spot price for government coins typically ranges from 3% to 8% for gold and 15% to 25% for silver, depending on market conditions and product availability. While these premiums represent additional upfront costs, they often provide better resale value and easier liquidation compared to generic products. Privately minted bars and rounds offer lower premiums, typically 1% to 3% over spot price for gold and 5% to 15% for silver. These products maximize the amount of precious metal acquired for each dollar invested, making them attractive for investors focused purely on metal accumulation rather than numismatic value. However, private mint products may face greater scrutiny during resale, as buyers must verify the reputation and authenticity of lesser-known manufacturers. Some private mint products also carry lower liquidity, particularly in smaller markets or during periods of market stress. Size considerations affect both premiums and practicality. Larger bars typically carry lower premiums per ounce but may be more difficult to sell in smaller quantities. One-ounce coins and bars provide optimal flexibility for most investors, allowing for partial liquidation without breaking larger positions. The purchasing process with a full-service dealer like Miles Franklin begins with a consultation to determine your investment objectives, budget, and timeline. Experienced brokers can explain the advantages and disadvantages of different products, helping you make informed decisions based on current market conditions and your specific needs. Pricing transparency is crucial in precious metals transactions. Reputable dealers provide real-time pricing based on current spot prices plus clearly disclosed premiums. Miles Franklin’s brokers explain all costs upfront, including any shipping, insurance, or handling fees, ensuring no surprises at the time of purchase. Payment methods vary among dealers, with most accepting wire transfers, checks, and credit cards. Wire transfers typically offer the best pricing, as they eliminate credit card processing fees that may be passed on to customers. Some dealers offer price protection programs that lock in pricing for a specified period, allowing time for payment processing without market risk. Delivery and insurance are handled professionally by established dealers. Products are shipped via insured, signature-required delivery services, with full insurance coverage from the dealer’s vault to your doorstep. Tracking information is provided, and most dealers maintain insurance coverage until successful delivery is confirmed. Secure storage represents one of the most important aspects of physical precious metals ownership. The storage method you choose affects not only the safety of your investment but also its liquidity and your peace of mind. Home storage offers maximum privacy and immediate access to your metals but requires significant security measures. A high-quality safe, preferably fireproof and waterproof, represents the minimum security requirement. The safe should be bolted to the structure and concealed from casual observation. Home insurance policies may require additional coverage for precious metals, and some insurers impose limits on coverage amounts. Bank safe deposit boxes provide professional security at reasonable cost, typically $50 to $200 annually depending on box size and location. However, access is limited to banking hours, and some experts question whether safe deposit box contents are fully protected during banking crises or government emergencies. Professional vault storage offers the highest level of security and insurance coverage. Established dealers like Miles Franklin can facilitate secure, audited storage solutions through partnerships with premier vault facilities across North America and internationally. These facilities provide segregated storage, regular audits, and comprehensive insurance coverage, ensuring your metals are protected against theft, damage, and loss. The choice of storage method depends on factors including the size of your holdings, your comfort level with home security, and your need for regular access. Many investors employ a combination of storage methods, keeping a small amount at home for immediate access while storing the majority in professional facilities for maximum security. The proliferation of sophisticated counterfeiting techniques has made the ability to spot fake gold coins and silver bars an essential skill for precious metals investors. While purchasing from reputable dealers like Miles Franklin virtually eliminates the risk of receiving counterfeit products, understanding basic authentication methods provides additional confidence and protection. The magnet test represents the simplest method for detecting fake precious metals. Gold and silver are not magnetic, so any attraction to a strong magnet indicates the presence of ferrous metals. However, this test is not foolproof, as sophisticated counterfeits may use non-magnetic base metals like copper or tungsten. Weight and dimension verification provides more reliable authentication. Genuine precious metals coins and bars have precise specifications for weight, diameter, and thickness. A digital scale accurate to 0.1 grams and a set of calipers can verify these specifications against published standards. Significant deviations indicate potential counterfeits. The ping test utilizes the unique acoustic properties of precious metals. When struck gently, genuine gold and silver produce a clear, sustained ringing sound, while base metals create a dull thud. This test requires practice and experience to interpret accurately but can be effective for detecting obvious fakes. Professional testing equipment like electronic gold testers and acid test kits provide more definitive results but require training and experience to use safely and accurately. These tools are typically used by dealers and coin shops rather than individual investors. Visual inspection can reveal obvious counterfeits through examination of details like mint marks, edge lettering, and surface quality. Genuine government coins exhibit sharp, clear details and consistent quality, while counterfeits often show blurred features, incorrect fonts, or poor surface finish. The most effective protection against counterfeit precious metals is purchasing exclusively from highly reputable, long-established dealers. Companies like Miles Franklin Precious Metals, with over 30 years in business and an impeccable reputation, have rigorous authentication procedures and relationships with primary distributors that virtually eliminate the risk of counterfeit products reaching customers. When purchasing from secondary markets, private parties, or online auctions, the risk of encountering counterfeits increases dramatically. The potential savings from these sources rarely justify the risks involved, particularly for inexperienced investors who may lack the knowledge and equipment necessary for proper authentication. The gold price prediction for 2025 from major financial institutions reflects unprecedented bullish sentiment among professional analysts and institutional investors. Goldman Sachs has set a target of $4,000 per ounce by mid-2026, with potential upside to $4,300 by year-end [7]. UBS has raised its forecast to $3,800 by end-2025, while JPMorgan projects an average of $3,675 in the fourth quarter of 2025, climbing toward $4,000 by mid-2026 [8]. These forecasts represent more than mere speculation—they reflect fundamental changes in the global monetary system that are driving unprecedented demand for precious metals. Central bank gold purchases have reached historic levels, with 43% of central banks planning to increase their reserves in 2025, up from just 29% in the previous year [9]. This institutional demand provides a powerful floor under gold prices and signals growing concerns about currency stability among monetary authorities worldwide. Geopolitical tensions continue to escalate, creating additional safe-haven demand for precious metals. The ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, combined with rising tensions between major powers, have investors seeking assets that exist outside the traditional financial system. Gold and silver provide this independence, maintaining their value regardless of political developments or sanctions regimes. Monetary policy uncertainty adds another layer of support for precious metals prices. Despite efforts to combat inflation through interest rate increases, central banks face the impossible task of maintaining price stability while supporting heavily indebted governments and financial systems. This policy contradiction virtually guarantees continued currency debasement and inflation, driving demand for real assets like gold and silver. The silver price forecast appears even more bullish, with some analysts predicting the metal could reach $50 per ounce in 2025, challenging its previous all-time high [10]. Silver’s unique position as both a monetary metal and essential industrial commodity creates multiple demand drivers that could propel prices significantly higher. Industrial demand for silver continues to accelerate, driven by the green energy transition and technological advancement. Solar panel production alone consumes over 100 million ounces annually, while electric vehicle manufacturing, 5G infrastructure, and advanced electronics create additional industrial consumption. This demand is largely inelastic, meaning it continues regardless of price levels. Supply constraints add urgency to the silver investment thesis. Unlike gold, which is primarily mined for monetary purposes, silver is largely produced as a byproduct of base metal mining. This means silver supply cannot easily respond to price increases, creating the potential for explosive price movements when demand exceeds available supply. The gold-to-silver ratio, currently around 81:1, suggests significant upside potential for silver relative to gold. Historical analysis shows this ratio typically contracts to 40:1 or lower during precious metals bull markets, implying silver could outperform gold by 100% or more if historical patterns repeat. These fundamental drivers create a compelling case for precious metals ownership in 2025 and beyond. While short-term price movements remain unpredictable, the long-term trajectory appears clearly upward, driven by monetary debasement, geopolitical uncertainty, and structural supply-demand imbalances that show no signs of resolution. The ability to hold physical precious metals within tax-advantaged retirement accounts represents one of the most powerful wealth preservation strategies available to American investors. A Precious Metals IRA allows individuals to diversify their retirement savings beyond traditional stocks and bonds while maintaining the tax benefits associated with qualified retirement plans. The Internal Revenue Service permits IRA ownership of specific precious metals products that meet minimum fineness requirements. For gold, the minimum fineness is 99.5%, while silver must be 99.9% pure. Approved products include American Gold and Silver Eagles, Canadian Gold and Silver Maples, Austrian Gold Philharmonics, and various bars produced by approved refiners. Self-directed IRAs provide the vehicle for precious metals ownership within retirement accounts. Unlike traditional IRAs that limit investment options to stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, self-directed IRAs allow investment in alternative assets including real estate, private businesses, and precious metals. This flexibility enables sophisticated investors to create truly diversified retirement portfolios. The process of establishing a Precious Metals IRA involves several steps, beginning with the selection of a qualified custodian who specializes in alternative asset IRAs. The custodian handles all administrative requirements, including IRS reporting, while working with approved depositories to store the physical metals in segregated accounts. Miles Franklin Precious Metals has developed expertise in facilitating Precious Metals IRAs, working with qualified custodians and depositories to streamline the process for their clients. Their experienced team can guide investors through the setup process, explain the various options available, and ensure compliance with all IRS requirements. Funding options for Precious Metals IRAs include direct contributions, transfers from existing IRAs, and rollovers from employer-sponsored plans like 401(k)s. Each method has specific rules and timelines that must be followed to avoid tax penalties. Professional guidance from experienced dealers like Miles Franklin can help navigate these requirements successfully. The storage requirement for IRA precious metals mandates that all metals be held by an approved depository rather than in personal possession. This requirement ensures proper segregation and insurance while maintaining the tax-advantaged status of the account. Approved depositories provide regular statements and audit reports, giving investors confidence in the security and authenticity of their holdings. Distribution options from Precious Metals IRAs include taking physical delivery of the metals or selling them and receiving cash distributions. The choice depends on individual circumstances and market conditions at the time of distribution. Required minimum distributions beginning at age 73 can be satisfied through either method. The combination of tax advantages and precious metals ownership makes Precious Metals IRAs particularly attractive for investors concerned about currency debasement and monetary system stability. By holding physical gold and silver within retirement accounts, investors can protect their retirement savings from both market volatility and currency devaluation while maintaining tax-deferred growth potential. The case for owning physical gold and silver in 2025 extends far beyond simple investment returns or portfolio diversification. These precious metals represent a fundamental choice between participating in a monetary system designed to transfer wealth from savers to debtors, or taking control of your financial destiny through ownership of real, tangible assets that have preserved wealth for millennia. The evidence supporting precious metals ownership has never been more compelling. Central banks worldwide are accumulating gold at historic rates, recognizing what individual investors are beginning to understand: fiat currencies are failing, and real assets provide the only reliable protection against monetary debasement. The forecasts from major financial institutions, predicting gold prices above $4,000 and silver approaching $50, reflect not speculation but recognition of fundamental economic realities. The distinction between physical ownership and paper proxies cannot be overstated. In a world where financial institutions hold multiple claims against the same assets, where government policies can freeze accounts and confiscate wealth, and where systemic risks threaten the entire financial system, physical precious metals provide independence and security that no paper asset can match. The process of acquiring physical gold and silver need not be complicated or intimidating. Working with established, reputable dealers like Miles Franklin Precious Metals ensures that your precious metals journey begins on solid ground. Their three decades of experience, impeccable reputation, and commitment to client education provide the foundation for successful precious metals investing. The time for action is now, while precious metals remain available at reasonable premiums and before the next monetary crisis makes acquisition difficult or impossible. Every day of delay represents another day of exposure to currency debasement, another day of watching your purchasing power erode, another day of depending on a financial system that serves its creators rather than its participants. Don’t wait for the next crisis to unfold. Protect your wealth and take a step towards financial sovereignty today. Contact the experienced brokers at Miles Franklin Precious Metals for a private consultation and learn how easy it is to add the timeless security of gold and silver to your portfolio. The choice is yours: continue participating in a monetary system designed to impoverish savers, or take control of your financial future through ownership of humanity’s oldest and most reliable forms of money. The precious metals are waiting. The question is whether you will act before it’s too late. [1] U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2025).

The center-left SPD, part of Germany's ruling coalition, says detaining failed asylum seekers indefinitely would be unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Germany is rolling out the EU's new Entry/Exit System. Follow DW for more. The Social Democrats (SPD) have censured a plan proposed by Germany's conservatives to detain rejected asylum seekers indefinitely, particularly when they have committed a crime or were deemed a security risk. Düsseldorf Airport is the first border entry point in Germany to introduce the EU's new Entry/Exit System for non-EU nationals. Germany's top trade unions have accused the government of hurting workers and warned employers not to make staff bear the cost of economic troubles. And while the far-right Alternative for Germany party retains the largest support among voters, the ruling coalition has seen a rise in approval ratings, according to a new poll. Below is a roundup of top headlines from Germany over the weekend of October 11 and 12: Germany's Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil said the government will re-examine a partial embargo on the supply of weapons to Israel. For more on Germany's policy toward arms exports to Israel, visit our Middle East blog. Germany is preparing to pledge at least €100 million ($116 million) to help in the reconstruction of Gaza, German Development Minister Reem Alabali-Radovan said Sunday. The exact amount is yet to be determined. Read more about Germany's pledge for the reconstruction of Gaza in DW's Middle East blog. German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil is seeking a consensus among the leaders of the ruling coalition on the multi-billion-euro savings plan needed to balance the 2027 federal budget. Klingbeil also serves as vice chancellor. "We have already started this process," he said in an interview to broadcaster ARD on Sunday, adding that he hopes a package of measures will be ready around the turn of the year. The coalition intends to present a comprehensive package that would achieve about €34 billion ($39.5 billion) in savings, according to the minister, who leads the junior coalition partner Social Democrats (SPD). Klingbeil emphasized that the package must be seen as fair. He said the plan will likely focus on social services, long-term care, pensions and healthcare. Chancellor Friedrich Merz's governing coalition is led by his conservative CDU/CSU alliance. In August, Merz said that Germany's welfare state "can no longer be financed." German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Sunday drew attention to the nearly 700 million people worldwide suffering from hunger. The United Nations has set the goal of a world without hunger by 2030 and, speaking at an event in Berlin marking Welthungerhilfe Week (World Hunger Aid Week), Steinmeier said: "We must not fail on the way there, despite all the setbacks that unfortunately exist." The aid week is an annual campaign organized in Germany by the humanitarian Welthungerhilfe (WHH) organization to raise awareness of global hunger. Ten years ago, the UN set the goal of a world without hunger for 2030, but this objective is unlikely to be met. According to a UN report published in July 2025, about 673 million people suffered from hunger last year, around 8% of the world's population. The report stated this was a slight decrease compared with 2023 (8.5%) and 2022 (8.7%). In his speech, Steinmeier pointed to the causes of hunger, citing wars and climate change. Steinmeier is a German politician who has served as Germany's president since 2017. Germany's president serves as the head of state, but the role is mainly ceremonial. Voters in the eastern German city of Frankfurt an der Oder chose an independent over the Alternative for Germany (AfD) candidate on Sunday, blocking what would have been the far-right party's first urban win in a mayoral election. Axel Strasser won with 69.8% of the vote against AfD candidate Wilko Möller, according to preliminary results. Turnout was 49.4%. In the first round on September 21, Strasser received 32.4% of the vote and Möller 30.2%, while candidates from the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SDP) were eliminated. Frankfurt an der Oder is in the eastern German state of Brandenburg, located directly on the border with Poland. It is distinct from Frankfurt am Main, the much larger financial hub in western Germany. Frankfurt an der Oder is the fourth-largest city in Brandenburg with around 57,000 residents. The AfD is classified as right-wing extremist by the Brandenburg Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Slightly fewer people attended this year's Cannstatter Wasen Volksfest in Stuttgart, with about 4.2 million visitors recorded over 17 days compared to 4.6 million last year, organizers said Sunday. The drop followed a record turnout in 2023. "We had a festival with less-than-ideal weather conditions," said Andreas Kroll, managing director of the in.Stuttgart events company. Despite the cool, variable weather conditions, he said the atmosphere remained positive and the safety plan worked well. On October 3 and again on Saturday, police briefly closed access to the grounds due to overcrowding. Police described the festival as largely peaceful, even though reported crimes rose by about 20% compared to last year. "We saw more offenses against emergency personnel but fewer thefts and property damage," said Jörg Schiebe of the Bad Cannstatt police. He added that while there was "a higher level of aggression," incidents remained low given the large crowds. The Cannstatter Volksfest is widely considered to be the second-largest beer celebration in the world after the Munich Oktoberfest. Police in northeastern Germany said they have received new leads into the disappearance of an 8-year-old boy who went missing two days ago. The youngster, who was identified by his first name, Fabian, went missing from the town of Güstrow in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on Friday. According to the police, the boy had left his mother's house with permission, possibly to see his father, who lives in another town. He did not return afterward. A police spokeswoman told DPA news agency that they had received additional tip-offs overnight into Sunday, adding they were examining bus video footage among other potential evidence. "There is no indication of a crime," the spokeswoman said. Police planned to conduct further interviews in the boy's neighborhood on Sunday, having used sniffer dogs the previous day to trace the boy's steps. Güstrow, a town with a population of 30,000, is located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Rostock. The European Union began the gradual rollout of a new border entry system for non-EU nationals, which could lead to longer processing times at border entry points. From Sunday, non-EU nationals will be required to register their biometric data, including fingerprints and facial images when entering the bloc. The so-called Entry/Exit System (EES) will be required once every three years. The rule doesn't affect EU nationals or those holding residence cards for member states. Amid concerns that the new process could lead to long delays at border checkpoints, several EU countries have opted for a phased roll-out. Germany, for example, will introduce the EES at the northwestern Dusseldorf Airport first, before the system is expanded to larger airports in Frankfurt and Munich and later to external sea borders. The EES is the first step in a new EU border system. In late 2026, a paid travel authorization is to become mandatory for non-EU nationals who do not require a visa. Germany's ruling coalition of CDU/CSU conservatives and left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD) has seen a modest rebound in approval ratings, according to a new poll. Some 28% of respondents said they were satisfied with the government's performance, up five points from three weeks ago. Approval for Chancellor Friedrich Merz personally rose to 27%, a gain of four points. The poll was conducted by Insa this week for Bild am Sonntag newspaper. Even so, a majority (63%) of Germans surveyed expressed dissatisfaction with the government and 62% disapproved of Merz himself. If a parliamentary election were held on Sunday, the governing coalition would collectively reach just 38%, short of a majority in parliament. The moderate conservative bloc would gain 24% of the vote, while the SPD would reach 14% The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) retains the largest single-party support at 26%. The center-left Social Democrats (SPD) have hit out at a proposal by their conservative coalition partners to reform deportation procedures for failed asylum seekers in Germany. The plan by Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt would allow authorities to detain rejected asylum seekers for an unlimited period, especially those who have committed crimes or pose a threat to security. Dobrindt's proposal comes as the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, seeks to speed up deportations across the 27-member bloc. Andy Grote, the SPD's Interior Senator for the state of Hamburg, told Welt am Sonntag newspaper that "an indefinite detention without the prospect of actual deportation would undoubtedly be unconstitutional." The interior ministries of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Lower Saxony also raised constitutional concerns.

Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported that Dobrindt's proposal also includes the deportation of Syrian nationals whose asylum applications had been rejected. They would be banned from returning to Germany for social visits. The proposal was, however, backed by Siegried Lorek, Baden-Württemberg's State Secretary for Migration, who said: "When it comes to repatriation, we are particularly focused on repeat and intensive offenders, as well as those who pose a threat."

Several people were injured in a shooting in a marketplace in the town of Giessen in the state of Hesse in central Germany, according to reports. Read more about the incident here. Berlin police have launched an investigation after two cases of graffiti vandalism were reported early on Saturday in the city's government district. Around 6:50 a.m. (0450 UTC), officers discovered orange paint markings — including a circle with a dot and an overturned euro symbol — on a low wall outside a Bundestag office building on Unter den Linden. While police were documenting the damage, Bundestag security reported similar graffiti on a construction site banner near the Brandenburger Tor S-Bahn station. The State Security Division of Berlin's criminal police is leading the investigation into both incidents. A roughly 2,000-year-old Roman silver treasure has been revealed near Borsum in the Hildesheim district of northern Germany, the Hildesheimer Allgemeine Zeitung has reported. According to the paper, a metal detectorist found the hoard in 2017 but kept it hidden for years before turning it over to police in April. Sebastian Messal, an archaeologist and regional director at the Lower Saxony State Office for Monument Preservation, said the discovery is of "enormous scientific importance." So far, about 450 silver coins, several silver bars, a gold ring and a gold coin have been recovered. The items are believed to date from the first century AD, Germany's DPA news agency said. Messal said the size of the hoard puts it "among the top five, perhaps top three, finds in Lower Saxony." Prosecutors in Hildesheim had opened an embezzlement investigation against the 31-year-old finder but later dropped the case due to the statute of limitations. The man said he initially hid the treasure at home out of fear of legal consequences. Archaeologists have since excavated the site and uncovered additional coins. Messal's team hopes the find will shed new light on life and trade in the Hildesheim region during the early Roman Empire. It remains unclear whether the treasure was buried by Romans or looted by Germanic tribes. Prosecutors are seeking a venue change for a possible new rape trial against the German man suspected in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. The Braunschweig public prosecutor's office has asked the Federal Court of Justice to overturn the man's October 2024 acquittal and hold a new trial at the Göttingen regional court, spokesman Hans Christian Wolters told the DPA news agency. The goal, he said, is to ensure an impartial handling of the case. Last year, a Braunschweig court acquitted the 48-year-old of multiple sexual assaults in Portugal, citing insufficient evidence. Prosecutors have appealed the decision, and Germany's highest civil and criminal court is now reviewing it for legal errors. The defense has called the acquittal the only correct outcome. Prosecutors had sought a 15-year prison sentence with subsequent preventive detention. The Göttingen court has not previously been involved in the case. It remains unclear when the Federal Court of Justice in Leipzig will issue a ruling. The man, a convicted sex offender, has drawn international attention because German investigators suspect him of involvement in the 2007 disappearance of three-year-old British girl Madeleine McCann in Praia da Luz, Portugal. He has not been charged in that case and is presumed innocent. The 48-year-old was released from prison last month after serving a separate sentence for rape in Portugal.

Title: Stablecoins on the march: Government green light and AI drive growing enterprise interest in digital currency

UPDATED 23:51 EDT / OCTOBER 10 2025 by Mark Albertson A major shift in U.S. government sentiment toward cryptocurrencies combined with innovation from AI are making the stablecoin market an emerging force in the digital asset economy. Indeed, there is mounting evidence that crypto is having its “ChatGPT moment” and stablecoins are leading some of the largest companies in the world into programmable finance. Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., X Corp., Airbnb Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Google LLC and Uber Technologies Inc. are all reportedly exploring the integration of stablecoins on their platforms. Ten major banks, including Bank of America and Deutsche Bank, are also investigating whether to issue stablecoins as part of their offerings. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to the value of fiat currency, often the U.S. dollar. “It seems like everyone is launching a stablecoin,” said Amy Kalnoki, co-founder and chief operating officer of Bitwave Inc. “Investing in digital assets has gone mainstream. It’s no longer a question of whether enterprises will adopt digital assets, but when.” Kalnoki spoke Thursday at the BuildETH Conference in San Francisco, a gathering of leaders in the Ethereum decentralized blockchain community. She noted that stablecoin transfer volume now exceeds that of global credit issuers Visa and Mastercard, reaching $27 trillion last year. A major reason for the tailwind behind stablecoins is the emergence of a U.S. law establishing the first comprehensive regulatory framework for the fledgling currency. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act was signed by President Donald Trump in July and reduced regulatory uncertainty for financial institutions, issuers and investors. The GENIUS Act, coupled with a “Project Crypto” initiative by the Securities and Exchange Commission to modernize rules and regulations that will enable crypto trading, have infused real financial power in the issuance and settlement of digital currencies, according to Gary Yang, founding partner at Eureka Finance. “The GENIUS Act and Project Crypto are redefining the rules of the financial game,” Yang told the BuildETH audience. “If everyone can print money, then you have to build up the pricing power of your money. This is what the GENIUS Act is doing.” Missing from this recent wave of regulatory permissiveness is the answer to a key question: How will consumers be able to use stablecoins as a ubiquitous currency if they are dependent on each issuer’s platform? This question of interoperability has not been resolved by the U.S. government, and it’s a prime topic of interest to those in the crypto world today. Amy Kolnaki of Bitwave described the growth of stablecoin adoption. “The key question is will stablecoins be interoperable or will they be siloed?” Kalnoki noted. “It is a really interesting time of how fractioned things are right now. It’s an interesting time to see who will win the stablecoin race.” The influence of AI in the crypto industry may push digital currency providers to build interoperable models for stablecoins. This is currently playing out as major players grapple with implementing a consistent payments standard, potentially using the x402 open protocol that has existed on the internet for decades. The x402 protocol is a “payment required” status code that sits on top of HTTP. Last month, Cloudflare Inc. and Coinbase Inc. launched the x402 Foundation to further the development of an open internet standard for payments. There is some urgency behind this initiative, as enterprises continue to adopt and implement AI agents. It’s expected that agents ultimately will shop, make buying decisions and execute payments on behalf of users. The x402 standard, along with the Agents Payment Protocol or AP2 under development by Google, provide early looks at how AI will automate consumer purchases. Kevin Leffew of Coinbase highlighted enterprise interest in the x402 standard. “The goal for x402 is to be something analogous to Kubernetes,” Kevin Leffew, go-to-market lead for the Coinbase Developer Platform, told the BuildETH gathering. “It’s driving value across platforms.” For the x402 standard to succeed as the agentic payment protocol, it has to be fast. This is not a simple problem to solve inside the crypto world which was built on the often-cumbersome application of per transaction settlement fees called “gas.” At the software company Edge & Node, developers are working on an enhancement for x402 that will allow for deferred payment schemes via signed vouchers that reduce gas costs and settle micropayments on-chain. The company previously built the Graph infrastructure for indexing on-chain data and views the agent payment protocol as a significant next step. “Trillions of dollars will flow agent to agent,” according to Edge & Node CEO Rodrigo Coelho. “We’ve got to surf this wave rather than being inundated by it.” The current momentum behind stablecoins and the crypto world has also brought renewed scrutiny on the industry’s privacy and security. If the floodgates open for agentic payments in decentralized finance, there is also a risk that users will end up disclosing far more than they bargained for. The blockchain uses a “mempool,” a public queue of unconfirmed transactions waiting in line for addition to the next available block. Malicious actors can exploit this process, known as a MEV or Maximal Extractable Value exploit, by remining blocks for theft or leveraging the visibility and force victims to sell at a lower price. Losses in this category are beginning to pile up. There have been reports that Coinbase lost $300,000 to MEV bots in August, and one user was victimized by a MEV exploit for $1 million in stablecoin last month. SKALE Labs Inc. has developed a BITE Protocol designed to encrypt blockchain transaction details before they are sent to the chain. It’s what co-founder and CEO Jack O’Holleran called passing the “Barista Test.” You want to buy coffee from your friendly barista, but you don’t want to expose all of your financial details in the process. “There’s so much innovation happening, but at some point you’ve got to deliver and reach the masses,” O’Holleran explained. “You are going to have a lot of robot baristas. We need to live in a world where you can buy things with stablecoins and not expose what you own.” Social engineering attacks and inadvertent disclosure of private keys have also exposed new vulnerabilities in the crypto world. That was reinforced in February when alleged hackers from North Korea stole $1.5 billion from an Ethereum wallet controlled by Bybit Technology Ltd., an exploit believed to be the largest cryptocurrency heist to date. Yevheniia Broshevan of Hacken outlined security risks confronting the crypto world. “Getting access to private keys is something we keep seeing over and over,” said Yevheniia Broshevan, co-founder and CEO of Hacken. “Be really cautious what you are clicking and who it is coming from.” Despite setbacks and ongoing risk in the cryptocurrency market, enthusiasm for stablecoins and mainstream growth in decentralized finance continues to grow. The optimism is fueled by a desire to become a force in “forex” or the foreign exchange market, which has a daily trading volume of $9.6 trillion and a total value range of $3.4 quadrillion to $3.9 quadrillion. By any measure, that’s real money. “The foreign exchange market is ultimately the only market these stablecoins are going after,” said Matthew Chruscielski, ecosystem lead at ZetaChain Inc. “Who wouldn’t want to be a part of $3.9 quadrillion?” Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.
