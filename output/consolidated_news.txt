Title: Marshmallow, the UK insurance startup for migrants, raises $90M at a $2B+ valuation

Now, with a million drivers insured and a profitable annual revenue run rate of $500 million, Marshmallow has raised a fresh $90 million to expand. Marshmallow plans to use the funding to move into financial services, as well as more insurance products that it hopes will appeal to a population of people that — despite the chilling effects of Brexit — is growing. “We think of migration as a huge opportunity,” CEO Oliver Kent-Braham said in an interview. He noted that in the U.K., there are more people coming out of the workforce than there are going in, with 1.2 million migrants recorded coming to the U.K. in 2024 alone. “We need migration to put more people into work, and we want to help people move and integrate into the U.K.” In Marshmallow’s view, that integration comes with being able to drive your own insured vehicle and soon, the startup hopes, buying home insurance and taking out loans. Marshmallow plans to launch its first lending product later this year, Kent-Braham said, en route to building a “one-stop shop” for everything financial and insurance that a new arrival to the U.K. might need to adjust to life. This round is roughly split 50-50 between equity and debt, according to Kent-Braham, and it is coming at a valuation of just over $2 billion. To put that into context, Marshmallow last raised funding at $1.25 billion in 2021. The startup has seen considerable growth on the business front in that time. In 2021, Marshmallow had insured just 100,000 people. Now, in cities like London, the one-million insured number is bolstered with a pink outdoor ad campaign that is hard to miss. Portage Capital is leading the round, with participation from BlackRock and Columbia Lake Partners. Previous backers of the company have included Passion Capital, Investec, and Scor. Marshmallow has raised around $220 million to date. Notably, the new round has been in the works since at least January, and Kent-Braham noted that one part of the equity was convertible debt raised in 2023. Marshmallow’s funding is coming at a complex moment for insurance startups in Europe. On one side, there is the grim story of WeFox. Backed by SoftBank, Omers, Salesforce, and dozens of others, WeFox’s valuation rose to as much $4.5 billion by 2023. Just two years later, after years of losses and complications in its distributed/broker-based business model, WeFox has fallen on hard times. The company has been selling off parts of its business and picking up lifeline financing to stay afloat. Yet there are also some brighter signs of insurtech startups building more sustainable businesses. And those that can demonstrate a strong technology story are getting attention from investors. Just last week, Ominimo — a new startup out of Poland — picked up a major strategic investor that invested $10 million at a valuation of over $200 million. It was Ominimo’s first time raising outside money after becoming profitable while bootstrapped. Like Marshmallow, the startup started off with car insurance and is rethinking actuarial formulas and using AI to make new inroads into risk prediction. While data science and AI are quickly becoming table stakes for insurance startups, there are other details about Marshmallow that set it apart from the pack — and even some of its bigger competitors (like the price-busting mega-retailer Tesco). The ideas of inclusivity and diversity that underpin how Marshmallow is approaching its target customer base run deep at the startup. Kent-Braham co-founded London-based Marshmallow with his identical twin, Alexander, and David Goaté. The twins really do look a lot alike. “You could actually be talking to Alexander right now!”, Oliver joked when we spoke for this story. More seriously, though, the startup is an underrepresented rarity in another way, too. It is one of what appears to be only two “unicorn” startups in the U.K. from a Black founder, the other being WorldRemit. The statistics are not hugely encouraging outside the U.K. either; one 2024 study found that across the U.K. and the U.S., only 3% of startups with valuations of over $1 billion have Black founders. At a time when diversity, equity, and inclusion programs are being dismantled in the U.S., it’s notable that Marshmallow’s investors see particular strength precisely because of its diverse leadership. “This is a very strong founding team,” Devon Kirk, GP and co-head of Portage Capital Solutions, said in an interview. “We think that financial services benefits from different perspectives and leaders coming up with innovative solutions to address those needs.” Topics Europe Editor Ingrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.

Title: Applied Materials becomes largest shareholder of advanced packaging firm BESI

Business FILE PHOTO: A smartphone with a displayed Applied Materials logo is placed on a computer motherboard in this illustration taken March 6, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Applied Materials has bought a 9 per cent stake in BE Semiconductor industries (BESI), the U.S.-based computer chip equipment supplier said on Monday. The transaction makes it the largest shareholder of the Dutch company making advanced semiconductors packaging tools, above Blackrock Institutional Trust, according to LSEG data. BESI's shares rose 9 per cent in early trade and could see their largest one-day rise in more than a year if the gains hold. It produces the world's most accurate hybrid bonding tool, a critical chip technology allowing two chips to be bonded directly on top of each other. "I think that this is an astute move by (Applied Materials) to foster closer collaboration between the two companies," Timm Schulze-Melander, analyst at Redburn Atlantic, said in an email. The purchase makes it clear Applied is not developing an alternative to BESI's hybrid bonding tech, he added. Unlike most semiconductor packaging steps, hybrid bonding occurs much closer to the chip's production line and work together with Applied Materials' tools. "I think shareholders will be extremely excited and will assume that Applied will eventually want to buy the entire company," Michael Roeg from Degroof Petercam said in an emailed comment. The world's second largest computer chip equipment maker said it did not intend to seek board representation at BESI. BESI said last November it remained committed to its independence, amid rumours involving a strategic deal with the company. Hybrid bonding is used on the world's most advanced chips, like AMD's X3D line, where the memory chip is bonded onto the processor at TSMC.

Title: Approved retirement funds: What is an ARF and how much will it cost me?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2025/04/15/approved-retirement-funds-what-is-an-arf-and-how-much-will-it-cost-me/
Time Published: 2025-04-15T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
It’s the pension drawdown product that more and more of us are opting for and, yet, getting a fix on how much this product is going to cost us can confuse. While shopping around can help with cutting costs when it comes to an approved retirement fund (ARF), you need to understand just what you have to pay for and how different options work, before you can make the best decision for you. An ARF is a Revenue-approved financial vehicle that allows you to keep your pension fund invested after you retire. This means that the capital can continue to grow (hopefully) – although there is a mandatory withdrawal each year of at least 4 per cent, rising to 5 per cent once you reach the age of 71. Mandatory at least in the sense that Revenue will assess you for income tax on the basis that you are withdrawing that amount so you might as well. One advantage of an ARF is that you can pass it on, tax free, in the event of your death to your spouse. “Most people now won’t have defined benefit pensions, it’s mostly defined contribution, so when it comes to drawdown, many people will be taking a lump sum and putting the balance into an ARF,” says John Tuohy, chief executive of Acuvest. “So, understanding and managing them are important for people.” The alternative for those retiring is an annuity, which provides for a guaranteed income for life. This has been less popular in recent years due to lower interest rates, which means your pension pot delivers a lower annual income. [ Annuities or ARFs: what’s the correct decision?Opens in new window ] These days, annuity rates have fallen back again to around 4.5 per cent (which means it pays out an annual income of €4,500 on every €100,000), so an ARF will be the choice for many. But how much is this investment product going to cost you? If you have been a member of an occupational pension, you probably haven’t had to worry too much about such things. But once you retire, you are going out on your own via an ARF. That will inevitably mean higher costs – and the higher the costs, the lower the return to you. After all, this fund will have to last your lifetime and, while investment performance may be uncertain, fees and charges are a definite. [ Half a million euro for a ‘moderate’ retirement? The lump sums you need to saveOpens in new window ] When you retire, the company managing your occupational pension provider will likely offer you an ARF. But this doesn’t mean you have to jump into it. Better to consider all your options before making such a big decision. “People shouldn’t shop for product until they decide what their investment strategy is,” says Tuohy. “What’s my strategy? Am I doing it myself? Am I getting advice? Have I got a plan?” So what do you need to know? “With an ARF, consumers need to understand there are three elements to it,” says Tuohy. First up is the qualified fund manager or product provider, which is typically a life insurance company – Aviva, New Ireland, Irish Life, Standard Life, Zurich Life or Royal London – or a company regulated under the EU’s MiFID directive. This is the ARF platform, and takes on the custody, payroll, tax-deduction functions etc of the ARF. The next element is the fund manager with whom your retirement savings will be invested, and this includes the likes of Vanguard, Blackrock etc. Finally, you have a financial broker or adviser, who advises and arranges on the set-up of an ARF, “and I’d like to think advisers provide ongoing advice in helping to manage the ARF”, adds Tuohy. All three of these have costs. But how much? When it comes to the ARF platform, you can expect to pay around 0.4 per cent of the fund every year for this service. Next up is your investment. As Tuohy notes, “most people in ARFs will invest in funds, cash or passive equity or bond funds”. These will typically cost from upwards of about 0.2 per cent a year in management charges – but it will depend on the complexity of such products. “If you pick more expensive funds, you should expect to pay more,” says Tuohy. On top of this there will be ongoing fund costs, which may be of the order of about 0.06 per cent. Then you have the financial adviser charges. Your adviser may charge a flat fee for setting up an ARF – figures of about €7,000 have been quoted – or they may earn commission from the fund manager. This can reduce your allocation to the ARF so watch out for this. “There should always be a minimum 100 per cent allocation,” says, Ken O’Gorman, a director of One Quote Financial Brokers, adding that a recent client was offered an ARF with a 99 per cent rate. If you do opt to pay a flat fee for set-up, remember that your adviser may also be earning commission on this transaction, so make sure this is added as a bonus allocation to your fund. There may also be a clawback if you move your ARF within a specified period. Your financial adviser will also charge an annual fee, of about 0.5 per cent – although this can be less or more – for offering an ongoing advice service. [ Choosing a financial adviser: The last thing you want to do is risk losing your savingsOpens in new window ] “In my view, many brokers may overcharge,” says, O’Gorman, who adds that charges should be dependent on the level of service on offer. “You need to get what you’re being charged for,” he says, adding: “Unfortunately you will find brokers selling products. They think that’s the solution”. O’Gorman charges between 0.2 per cent and 0.25 per cent a year for ongoing advice, depending on the size of the ARF. “It’s about constructing ARFs in a more nuanced way to protect the client,” he says, adding that buying an ARF should not be “a rush job”, and that a typical approach will see him construct a portfolio that blends different managers. All in then, your ARF can cost between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent or so a year. This is not insignificant; if your ARF is worth €100,000, it will cost you between €1,000 and €1,500 a year, increasing to between €5,000 and €7,500 for an ARF valued at €500,000. “Everything is negotiable, especially if the ARF is particularly large,” advises O’Gorman. The larger your ARF, the lower you can expect your potential charges to be – at least as a percentage, if not in value terms. For example, with Cantor Fitzgerald, you’ll pay 1.25 per cent a year on a portfolio that is smaller than €100,000 on an execution only basis, rising to 1.5 per cent for an advisory option. Portfolios in excess of €1 million have a fee of 0.5 per cent execution only, or 0.75 per cent with advice. Transactional charges may also reply. Once you understand the different elements of an ARF, you can then consider your options. If you just want a standard ARF, and are happy to take this out without ongoing financial advice, you could look for an execution-only standard product. [ Women, take control to ensure you have enough income in retirementOpens in new window ] Broker Gerard Sheehy of execution-only.ie, for example, offers low cost options with providers including Standard Life, Royal London and Zurich Life. With Standard Life for example, you’ll pay annual charges of 0.65 per cent, which includes broker commission. Additional charges apply related to the specific funds you choose, but there are low-cost options here too – if you pick the Vanguard Global Stock Index tracking fund, for example, that 0.65 per cent would increase to 0.67 per cent. Going through an adviser to buy your ARF from a life company – and getting the associated financial advice – will push the cost north of about 1 per cent. Such products offer a lot of choice “but you’re going to have to accept limitations” says Tuohy, in terms of investment opportunities and choices. If you want “a much fuller window on to the market”, you’ll be looking at a more sophisticated option, such as that offered through Conexim, a subsidiary of Irish Life. You can only get access to this through an adviser (so remember to add in the cost of this too), but for a fee of about 0.4 per cent, you’ll be able to access a much wider range of investment choices (it has more than 9,000 funds on its platform). And fees on these funds may be lower than those offered through the standard life company option. If neither of these options (ie a standard ARF with advice, or execution only) suits you, you can also consider managing your ARF yourself. A self-directed option allows you to access a much wider range of investment options, such as structured products, property, private equity and gold, as well as traditional equity funds. And it gives you greater control over your investment decisions. But should you opt for self-directed, you may find you have to pay more. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Total Control 24 (TC24) Under Review: Best Prostate Health Supplement for Men in 2025

April 14, 2025 20:14 ET | Source: Total Control 24 (TC24) Total Control 24 (TC24) New York City, April 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 1. Introduction: Prostate Health in Men Over 40 Prostate health is one of the most overlooked yet critical areas of concern for aging men. As men enter their 40s and beyond, hormonal shifts, inflammation, and lifestyle changes begin to impact the health of the prostate gland—a small but vital organ that supports urinary function and reproductive health. Recent studies reveal that nearly 50% of men in their 50s and up to 90% of men in their 80s suffer from symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an age-associated enlargement of the prostate. These symptoms include: For many, these symptoms emerge gradually and are often dismissed as a regular part of aging. However, untreated BPH can significantly reduce quality of life. It disrupts sleep, causes anxiety in social settings, and contributes to chronic fatigue and low mood. Most men are unaware that the underlying triggers are often tied to an overproduction of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), declining testosterone levels, and elevated oxidative stress that inflames the prostate tissue. These biological shifts reduce urinary flow efficiency, disrupt bladder function, and can impact overall male vitality. While prescription medications like alpha-blockers or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are commonly used, they often come with unwanted side effects such as dizziness, low libido, or sexual dysfunction. That's why more men are turning to natural prostate supplements to regain control of their health—without harsh chemicals. This brings us to Total Control 24 (TC24), a revolutionary prostate support supplement that is being recognized as a top-rated formula for prostate health in men over 40. Designed to support normal prostate size, healthy urinary flow, and hormonal balance, TC24 combines clinically researched, bioavailable ingredients into a powerful daily solution. In this in-depth review, we will examine how Total Control 24 works, explore the top prostate health ingredients, evaluate the science behind its formula, compare it with other popular prostate supplements, and outline the pricing, return policy, and customer satisfaction guarantee. If you are seeking the best prostate health supplement that delivers results naturally, Total Control 24 deserves your attention. 2. Understanding the Problem: Why You're Experiencing Prostate Symptoms As men age, prostate-related discomfort becomes increasingly common—and it's not just about getting older. Several interconnected biological and environmental factors contribute to the gradual decline of prostate function. Understanding these causes is the first step toward lasting relief and better health. Hormonal Shifts and DHT Accumulation One of the primary drivers behind prostate enlargement is the hormonal imbalance that occurs with age. Testosterone levels begin to decline in a man's 40s, while dihydrotestosterone (DHT)—a more potent derivative of testosterone—often remains elevated. DHT can cause the cells in the prostate to multiply excessively, leading to an enlarged gland that puts pressure on the urethra. This creates frustrating urinary issues, including weak stream, urgency, and nighttime urination. Oxidative Stress and Inflammation Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body. In the prostate, this can lead to inflammation and cellular damage. Chronic inflammation is a key factor in the development of BPH and may even contribute to more serious conditions if not addressed. Antioxidant-rich nutrients, like those found in TC24, help reduce this inflammation and protect the prostate against cellular breakdown. Lifestyle Factors That Exacerbate Symptoms In addition to biological changes, lifestyle habits also influence prostate health. Poor diet, lack of physical activity, alcohol consumption, and chronic stress can all worsen urinary symptoms and hormone imbalances. Additionally, high body fat can lead to increased estrogen production in men, further throwing off the delicate balance of male hormones. The Emotional Toll of Prostate Problems The daily struggle of dealing with frequent bathroom trips, poor sleep, or sexual dissatisfaction is more than a physical burden—it can affect self-confidence, work performance, and relationships. Many men report feeling embarrassed or isolated due to their symptoms, which in turn can lead to anxiety or even depression. Prostate issues are not just an inconvenience; they are an actual quality-of-life issue. The good news is that men do not have to live with these challenges. Addressing the root causes of prostate issues—hormonal imbalance, inflammation, and oxidative stress—can deliver lasting relief. This is precisely where Total Control 24 excels, providing a natural and comprehensive approach to restoring prostate health. Learn More About Total Control 24 Ingredients and How They Support Prostate Wellness 3. What is Total Control 24 (TC24)? Total Control 24 (TC24) is a next-generation prostate health supplement created by Adem Naturals. Designed specifically for men over 40 who are struggling with the signs of prostate enlargement and urinary discomfort, TC24 offers a multi-action formula targeting the key root causes of prostate decline. Rather than simply masking symptoms, TC24 works to support: This advanced supplement is manufactured in the USA in an FDA-registered, GMP-certified facility. TC24 uses a clean-label formula that is non-GMO, free of gluten and soy, and contains no artificial additives or fillers. Each capsule delivers a potent dose of herbal extracts, minerals, and antioxidants—all of which are selected for their ability to support long-term prostate health. Its formula includes several clinically backed ingredients such as Pygeum Africanum, Lipophytol®, Boron, and Myrciaria Jaboticaba, which work synergistically to promote urinary comfort and hormonal harmony. What makes Total Control 24 unique is its strategic formulation: the combination of time-tested herbs and patented nutrients designed for bioavailability, precision dosing, and comprehensive coverage of prostate and urinary functions. Whether you're just starting to notice changes in your urinary habits or have been living with BPH-related discomfort for years, TC24 presents a compelling, natural solution worth considering. The Science Behind Total Control 24 Ingredients Myrciaria Jaboticaba (Jaboticaba) Myrciaria jaboticaba is a Brazilian superfruit known for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is rich in polyphenols such as ellagic acid and anthocyanins, which play a central role in modulating inflammation—a key contributor to prostate enlargement and discomfort. Recent research from the Federal University of Alfenas (2024) demonstrated that jaboticaba peel extract significantly reduces markers of oxidative stress and cellular inflammation. Additionally, a 2020 study published in the journal Food & Function found that its polyphenolic compounds protect DNA from oxidative damage, a critical factor in preventing cellular aging and potential mutation in prostate cells. Further evidence published in Food Chemistry (2025) and ScienceDirect highlights jaboticaba's role in reducing nitric oxide overproduction, which is often elevated in inflamed prostate tissue. This makes jaboticaba an essential component of natural prostate health formulas, helping maintain cellular integrity, reduce swelling, and support normal prostate function. Lipophytol® (Phytosterol Complex) Lipophytol® is a patented microencapsulated phytosterol complex that delivers enhanced bioavailability of beta-sitosterol and related plant sterols. These compounds are known to inhibit 5-alpha-reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone closely associated with prostate growth and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Studies confirm that beta-sitosterol can improve urinary flow, reduce post-void residual volume, and alleviate symptoms like urgency and weak stream. Lipophytol®'s advanced encapsulation ensures better stability and absorption, allowing for more consistent and reliable results. As a DHT blocker and bladder support agent, Lipophytol® helps address hormonal imbalances and urinary discomfort, two common issues affecting men with aging prostates. Pygeum africanum (African Plum Tree Bark Extract) Pygeum africanum has been used for decades in European herbal medicine to treat prostate-related urinary symptoms. Its bioactive compounds—phytosterols, triterpenes, and ferulic acid esters—exhibit both anti-inflammatory and anti-androgenic effects. According to a Cochrane meta-analysis and studies published in The American Journal of Medicine, Pygeum extract consistently reduces the frequency of nighttime urination, increases peak urine flow, and lowers the volume of residual urine. It also helps regulate hormonal activity within the prostate, contributing to symptom relief in men with enlarged prostates. With extensive clinical support, Pygeum provides multidimensional benefits, targeting inflammation, supporting hormone regulation, and improving quality of life through enhanced urinary function. Boron Boron is a trace mineral that plays a significant role in maintaining prostate health, particularly through its effects on hormone metabolism and inflammation. Research in Cancer Causes & Control (2007) and other peer-reviewed journals have shown that men with higher boron intake have a lower incidence of prostate cancer. Boron helps balance testosterone and estrogen levels, lowers prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and enhances vitamin D metabolism—all of which are beneficial for prostate tissue maintenance. It also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by modulating cytokines and reducing oxidative stress markers. In the context of Total Control 24, boron acts as a foundational mineral that enhances hormonal balance and supports prostate health at the cellular level, especially in aging men. Discover Why Total Control 24 Is One of the Best Prostate Supplements for Men Over 40 5. What Makes Total Control 24 the Best Prostate Health Supplement in 2025 With a saturated market full of over-the-counter remedies, herbal blends, and pharmaceutical options, choosing a prostate supplement can be overwhelming. What sets Total Control 24 (TC24) apart is its combination of ingredient quality, formulation integrity, clinical rationale, and consumer-focused transparency. These attributes collectively make TC24 one of the most advanced and trusted prostate support supplements currently available. Superior Ingredient Sourcing and Formulation TC24 stands out by leveraging patented, high-quality ingredients like Lipophytol® and Myrciaria Jaboticaba, which are not found in generic prostate pills. These ingredients are selected based on rigorous scientific evidence supporting their roles in DHT regulation, inflammation reduction, and urinary support. Unlike many supplements that hide behind proprietary blends, TC24 offers transparency in its formulation. Additionally, the supplement is manufactured in a GMP-certified, FDA-registered facility in the USA, ensuring pharmaceutical-grade standards and consistent potency. The clean-label promise—no gluten, soy, artificial binders, or GMOs—further demonstrates the product's commitment to purity and safety. Multi-Pathway Mechanism of Action TC24 doesn't rely on a single mechanism. Instead, it addresses prostate health on multiple fronts: This multi-pronged strategy ensures that users experience relief from both acute symptoms (like frequent urination) and long-term risks (like unchecked prostate growth). Favorable Comparison to Leading Brands Compared to other high-profile prostate formulas such as Super Beta Prostate, ProstaGenix, and Prost-P10x, TC24 excels in ingredient diversity and synergy. While others rely heavily on saw palmetto alone, TC24 integrates a broad spectrum of targeted compounds that work together more effectively. It also offers more excellent value with precision dosing, clinical-grade ingredient selection, and better bioavailability via Lipophytol® delivery. Many competitors overlook absorption optimization, a crucial element when dealing with fat-soluble nutrients like phytosterols. Clean Label and Consumer Safety TC24 is designed for long-term use without dependency or dangerous interactions. Users can feel confident knowing they are taking a supplement that is: For aging men looking for a reliable, comprehensive, and well-formulated solution to support prostate health and urinary comfort, Total Control 24 delivers on every front. 6.

How to Use TC24 for Best Results Consistency is key when it comes to achieving and maintaining the best results with any natural supplement—and Total Control 24 (TC24) is no exception. This section offers clear usage guidelines to help you get the most out of your investment in prostate health. Recommended Dosage Each bottle of Total Control 24 contains 60 capsules. The standard dosage is two capsules daily, taken preferably with a meal and a full glass of water. This allows for maximum nutrient absorption and ensures the active ingredients begin working effectively without causing stomach upset. Many users opt to take one capsule in the morning and one in the evening, which helps sustain consistent ingredient levels in the body throughout the day. When to Expect Results While some men may begin to notice improvements in urinary flow, frequency, and comfort within the first 7–10 days, optimal results typically become evident after 30–60 days of continuous use. This allows time for hormonal balancing, reduced inflammation, and cellular support to take hold. Results vary depending on individual health conditions, lifestyle, and the severity of prostate symptoms. However, most users report a steady and noticeable reduction in nighttime urination, urgency, and residual bladder sensation after one to two months. Can You Take It With Other Supplements or Medications? TC24 is made with natural, well-tolerated ingredients and is generally safe to take alongside other supplements. However, you are currently taking prescription medications for prostate issues, blood pressure, or hormone therapy.

Long-Term Use and Safety Total Control 24 is designed for ongoing use and does not create dependency or tolerance. In fact, many men choose to take TC24 as part of their long-term wellness plan to proactively maintain healthy prostate size, urinary comfort, and hormonal balance well into their 60s, 70s, and beyond.

Title: Small businesses take it on chin in Trump’s tariff war — here’s how they’re trying to weather storm

Prestident Trump’s tariffs are socking US businesses across the board — but it’s the smaller companies that are really taking it on the chin. Small and midsize firms account for $868 billion, or about a third, of yearly US imports, according to the Census Bureau. While these companies are tiny compared to the likes of Microsoft, Amazon or Lululemon, they still rely on Chinese manufacturing — and they’re far less equipped to handle punishing financial disruptions like this. Nearly one in five small-to-midsize firms are pessimistic about their chances of survival over the next five years, according to a new report from PYMNTS Intelligence report. Just under 7% of all firms surveyed — and 13% of those without access to financing — believed they were unlikely to survive the next two years. The heads of some of these small businesses spoke to The Post about their fears: Isaac Larian, chief executive MGA Entertainment, voted for President Trump in November — but lately, he’s not so sure he made the right decision. “Frankly, I’m getting angry,” said the toymaker of Bratz dolls, L.O.L. Surprise and other wildly popular items. In just two weeks, the Los Angeles-based company has paid nearly $10 million in tariffs to import its merchandise to the US from China. That has crimped plans for MGA’s Little Tikes line of toddler toys — among the few US toy makers that owns a factory here — to expand a factory in Hudson, Ohio that currently employs 700 workers. Instead, MGA could be laying off some of those workers, Larian told The Post. “We were going to break ground later this year, but we have to put it on hold,” Larian said. Meanwhile, Bratz dolls that cost $15 right now will likely cost as much as $30 in time for Christmas. At that rate, the company will lose up to 40% of its sales and 40% of its profit this year, Larian said. The toy industry has been lobbying for an exemption to the 145% tariff on goods made in China and sees the carve out for tech companies over the weekend as unfair, he added. “Big companies like Apple have the money and clout to get Mr. Trump’s ear,” Larian said. His message to President Trump? “You are a great man and you love the USA. I am a big supporter of you,” Larian began. “We have invested tens of millions of dollars to expand and plan to do the same and make more toys in the USA. “We have now put that on hold because of tariffs, as our sales are declining big time because of them. Please come and visit” the company’s factory in Ohio. “It will be a great honor,” he continued before uttering a final plea. “Please exempt toys from tariffs. We only have 255 days left till Christmas.” Before the tariff wars, Wonderstate Coffee was on track to grow 15% this year. The java distributor was also getting ready to invest $300,000 in new packaging equipment and open its fourth cafe, in Madison, Wis. Now, the company, which supplies supermarkets and restaurants across the Midwest, is talking to bankers to expand a line of credit so it can pay an extra $20,000 in tariffs on a shipment of choice beans coming from Ethiopia. “We have a fear that we’ll be in a cash crunch,” Wonderstate TJ Semanchin told The Post. “You start to question whether it’s the time to invest in growth.” While Semanchin is not planning to lay off employees, he said he may have to slash an employee profit-sharing program. The 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs last week didn’t spare the importer, which is still stuck paying an extra 10% for everything it brings in from coffee producers overseas. “A 10% increase on all of our costs is still a massive disturbance for us,” Semanchin said. “These swings of tens of thousands of dollars from day to day are making us less hopeful. It’s sinking in on how it will hit our actual costs.” On top of the $20,000 in tariffs, Wonderstate will have to pay approximately $4,000 in interest to borrow the money for the duties, Semanchin said. Tarptent Inc. — a Nevada City, Calif.-based company that makes lightweight tents and other outdoor and camping gear — relies on three manufacturing facilities. One is in Hong Kong, another is in Vietnam and a third is in Seattle. “As of today, because of tariff rates, we have had to suspend all operations” at the Hong Kong factory, Tarptent President Henry Shires told The Post. “I don’t know where we’re going next.” With the recent increase in the tariff rate to 37.5% from 7.5%, Shires said that the company recently had to pay more than $51,000 in levies — up from around $10,000 that he would have paid previously. The company generates around $2.5 million per year, he added. If there is no change on the tariff front, that number will drop to under $1 million, Shires said. Shires told The Post that the company currently has enough inventory to sell through the summer, but “we won’t have enough stock to stay open” going into the fall if the tariffs remain in place. At that point, Tarptent will “either shut down or severely redefine what it is we support in the industry,” Shires said. Vikre Distilling is waiting to hear back from vendors that supply it with everything from corks, labels and bottles. The Duluth, Minn., distiller has been making vodka, gin and whiskey for the past decade and struggled to raise prices during the height of inflation over the past couple of years. “We saw a huge drop in sales,” said owner Emily Vikre, noting that bar, restaurant and retail customers alike have drastically cut back on orders. “Since the start of this year, we have seen a pullback because consumers are being more conservative about their spending,” Vikre told The Post. “But now our retail customers have stopped ordering. They are worried about being stuck with a bunch of inventory.” Vikre is bracing for vendors to hike prices again because of the tariffs. Her label maker, for example, relies on imports from China to make their labels adhere to the glass bottles. If the price hikes are unmanageable, Vikre is considering returning some of her warehouse and retail space to her landlord. Sarah McDonald, co-owner of apparel store Out There Outfitters in Wayne, Pa., told The Post that she’s concerned she may need to lay off some of the 15 people she employs. “Honestly when the tariffs were announced I felt like basically every small business in America was told they will probably have to go out of business,” McDonald said. She added that the tariffs will likely mean higher prices, which will be passed on to the consumer. Adding to the uncertainty is whether the tariffs will be implemented, at what rate and when, she said. “It was so extreme how high the tariffs were,” McDonald said, adding: “Things have changed, numbers are changing, dates are changing.” “I understand the rationale behind the tariffs. There’s been an imbalance,” said Jay Kamhi, founder of Clearwater, Fla.-based Kamhi World, which sells the Mr. Predictor fortune-telling toy. The Amazon seller, which exclusively imports all of its custom toys from a facility in China, has temporarily halted all overseas manufacturing. That’s because the tariffs could send the cost of his fall and holiday deliveries, currently pegged at about $1 million, to as much as $1.5 million. “If we have to pay $1.5 million in penalties, or tariffs . . . we make no profit. We lose money. It’s not sustainable by any stretch of the imagination, and we’ve got nowhere to go,” Kamhi told The Post. The company is looking into a production shift to Vietnam or Mexico, but “you got these big, expensive molds that are sitting in China, and you’ve got to find a way to transport them. You’ve got to find a factory that will do it. A lot of factories, for Vietnam, for example, we’re told, ‘We don’t have space for you. Every person is trying to come to our factory right now. We don’t have room for you.’ ” Kamhi said he’s looked into US manufacturing in the past and would love to do it — but the specialized molds and electronics that go into his toys are only available overseas. Even if there was capacity at US facilities, it would cost about 10 times more, he said. Layoffs are not an option for Kamhi. The head of marketing at Kamhi World is engaged to Kamhi’s daughter; his operations employee is married to his other daughter. The company’s executive director — whose father is good friends with Kamhi — has been with Kamhi World for 15 years. “Each one of these people – their families depend on this company doing well,” Kamhi told The Post. “Literally overnight all these people now are terrified that they’re not gonna have money to support their families. My daughter called me up two weeks ago crying, going, ‘Dad, how are we going to get through this?’ ” Advertisement

Title: Reflections from Columbia’s Forum on Climate-Related Fiduciary Duty
URL: https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2025/04/14/reflections-from-columbias-forum-on-climate-related-fiduciary-duty/

As the physical and economic harms of climate change accumulate, corporate managers have faced increasing pressure to reduce their companies’ greenhouse gas emissions and adapt their businesses to climate-related risks. In parallel, civil society organizations and activist investors have increasingly sought to compel private sector action on climate change, while the “anti-ESG” political movement has sought to prevent financial managers from considering climate risks entirely. These discussions have frequently centered on one key element of corporate governance: fiduciary duties. Broadly, fiduciary duties arise when one person entrusts another with discretion over their financial affairs. For decades, legal scholars have recognized that fiduciary duties under corporate law may force private companies to address climate change. Writing in 2002, Professor Perry Wallace argued that both the physical threats of climate change and the legal and economic impacts of society’s response to those threats will inevitably implicate “the heart of corporate governance.” In recent years, as the impacts of climate change and the energy transition have become more apparent, boards and courts have faced a challenging question: what fiduciary duties do corporate directors and officers owe around climate change? On February 21, 2025, the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law and the Millstein Center for Global Markets and Corporate Ownership, in partnership with the European Corporate Governance Institute, hosted a colloquium exploring that question. This blog offers reflections on the Colloquium and highlights areas for future research and action around climate-related fiduciary duties. The New Climate Fiduciaries Colloquium, held at Columbia Law School, brought together approximately three hundred participants who explored whether, and how, corporate directors and officers are obligated to respond to climate change. The Colloquium intentionally gathered a diverse set of panelists and participants, and was not intended to produce consensus about the scope or direction of climate-related fiduciary duties. See here for the Colloquium agenda; video recordings of the keynote addresses and panels are available on the Sabin Center’s YouTube channel and linked below. The Colloquium revealed several key dynamics that will shape the development of climate-related fiduciary duties. This section discusses three core takeaways from the Colloquium, which reflect the interpretation of the authors, and may not align with the opinions of every panelist or attendee. The Colloquium highlighted a core problem: a significant portion of corporate law commentary suffers from a lack of exposure to climate science and policy. Corporate scholars addressing climate change frequently understate or ignore the imminence and economic significance of climate change. While the Colloquium’s panelists and the attendees offered a sophisticated grasp of climate change, some influential corporate scholars like Professor Stephen Bainbridge frame climate change as an issue of social responsibility rather than an economic threat. Scholars like Bainbridge argue that climate change should trigger no fiduciary obligations because the duty of corporate directors and officers is to understand and oversee “the corporation’s business,” not to conform to “emerging social norms.” And while other recent scholarship finds that fiduciary duties extend to “mission-critical” risks to corporations, including “ESG” risks, this work assesses climate change as a reputational and liability concern for major emitters, and does not focus on the material supply chain and market disruptions that many corporations face due to climate change. And as several Colloquium panelists highlighted, courts are often ill-informed about the economic risk that companies face from the changing climate. Even academics with a sophisticated understanding of climate risks sometimes shorthand the terminology that distinguishes between corporate climate mitigation (the process of reducing greenhouse gas emissions), and corporate climate adaptation (the process of responding to the changing physical, legal, and economic landscape caused by climate change). This imprecision can undercut promising lines of debate. For example, during panel discussions focused on climate mitigation, the debate revolved around whether fiduciary law implied any broad duty to for fiduciaries to monitor the impact of corporate activities on the wider world. However, several panelists also raised when, and whether, corporate fiduciaries could owe a duty to preserve the long-term value of firm or portfolio investments through climate adaptation, even if that adaptation is not immediately rewarded by the capital markets. Because the distinction between mitigation and adaptation was rarely clarified, several attempts to discuss fiduciary duties related to long-term corporate climate adaptation fell flat. This ambiguity in conversations among highly informed experts is likely mirrored and magnified in boardroom discussions. “Fiduciary duty” describes a category of legal obligation, but fiduciary duties arise in different, and legally distinct, contexts. Board members owe their corporations different obligations than asset managers owe their clients, for example. The different silos of fiduciary duty law are easily confused in judicial decisions and broader commentary. For example, in the weeks leading up to the Colloquium, a Texas District Court ruled in Spence v. American Airlines, that American Airlines, Inc. had breached its fiduciary duty to its pension beneficiaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by allowing its investment manager, BlackRock, to consider certain ESG issues. While this decision has not been affirmed by any higher court, and is one among many “anti-ESG” cases that have been heavily criticized by corporate and antitrust scholars, several panelists and participants in the Colloquium noted that it has already impacted their discussions with corporate directors and officers. This should be somewhat surprising, as the fiduciary duties owed by pension fund managers under the federal statute ERISA are similar to, but distinct from, the similarly-named duties owed by corporate directors and officers that arise from state statutes and common law. Setting aside the merits of the decision, there is no reason to think that the ERISA-focused ruling in Spence should directly affect the decisions of judges assessing fiduciary duties that arise under other legal schemes. But the distinctions are muddled, boards and officers may respond by being overly cautious, or by adhering to the wrong set of obligations. Discussions at the Colloquium highlighted that there is important legal analysis to be done clarifying the different sources of obligations for fiduciaries. Debates at the Colloquium also suggest that corporate climate action will continue to be shaped by litigation. Panelists discussed emerging litigation theories that seek to force corporations to respond to climate change, or to protect the discretion of directors and officers to independently assess climate risks. There was also concern about the potential for anti-climate litigation to preclude corporations from acting on climate risks. Experts debated whether competing standards would create a “Brussels effect” around climate corporate fiduciary duties, if multi-jurisdictional companies are pressured into a “race to the top” to operate in jurisdictions with high regulatory standards. In response to rising international standards and the increasing legal salience of climate change, plaintiffs may seek to bring fiduciary duty claims against directors and officers who fail to oversee corporate compliance with climate change laws in other jurisdictions. Corporations also face legal action from anti-ESG politicians and fossil fuel interests seeking to prevent corporate compliance with climate change-related laws in other jurisdictions. For example, Texas House Bill 4049, introduced on April 9, 2025, purports to ban companies doing business in Texas from complying with greenhouse gas reporting laws in other jurisdictions. This bill has not passed, and its legality and practical impact are highly suspect. But it reflects a troubling trend opposing corporate responses to climate change. Some panelists observed that this anti-environmental activism may, somewhat ironically, prompt fiduciary litigation from climate advocates defending corporations, in an effort to establish that fiduciary duty law gives directors and officers the right to consider climate risks, even if it does not necessarily mandate that they do so. The 2025 Colloquium on Climate-Related Fiduciary Duties suggests several new avenues to advance private sector responses to climate change. As discussed above, corporate law scholars and climate change experts sometimes lack a shared expertise and terminology. A body of neutral, educational research and “primer” resources would be valuable to reduce confusion about the legal status of climate-related fiduciary duties. This material could educate researchers, practitioners, commentators, and the public about the different silos of fiduciary duty law, with analysis of the climate-related rules and caselaw applicable to each. This would both inform the public discourse around climate-related fiduciary duties, and, importantly, help corporate decision-makers and their counsel to understand the range of permitted corporate climate action. Interdisciplinary scholarship is also vital to address areas where climate-related fiduciary duties intersect with other bodies of law. Participants in the Colloquium are already conducting groundbreaking research at the intersection of fiduciary duty and transactional law, religious freedom, and antitrust, among other areas. Greater resources are necessary to support these efforts and generate scholarship that responds to the pressures and exigencies of climate change across all sectors and practice areas. The Colloquium also highlighted key areas where researchers can respond to legal developments that are undermining climate action. It is clear that courts, commentators, and corporate legal decisionmakers often use flawed assumptions about the physical, economic, and societal impacts of climate change. Elsewhere, judicial decisions around fiduciary duty are often laden with assumptions drawn from Law and Economics literature that do not necessarily reflect the reality of markets or the full impact of climate change. For example, consider when courts are asked to use the present value of shares as a metric of corporate harm: this seemingly neutral approach depends on a version of the efficient markets hypothesis, which presumes that markets incorporate important information into the price of stocks. However, many studies suggest that climate change-related risk is imperfectly priced by capital markets. There is a significant need for research and scholarship that identifies the underlying assumptions of corporate law, and assesses where such assumptions may fail under the physical, economic, and societal pressures of climate change. Through its the Initiative on Climate Risk and Resilience Law (ICRRL), the Climate Law & Finance Initiative (CLFI), the Sabin Center is committed advancing this research and building on the complex discussions raised during Colloquium.

Title: Report: Crypto Firm Anchorage Digital Bank Investigated by Homeland Security

Crypto company Anchorage Digital Bank is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The nature of the investigation is not known, but the DHS organization that is running it — the El Dorado Task Force — is dedicated to combating money laundering and other financial crimes, Barron’s reported Monday (April 14), citing unnamed sources. As part of its investigation, the task force has contacted former Anchorage Digital Bank employees and asked about the firm’s practices and policies, according to the report. Neither Anchorage Digital Bank nor the Department of Homeland Security immediately replied to PYMNTS’ request for comment. Anchorage Digital Bank offers asset safeguarding and trading services to financial institutions and governments, according to the Barron’s report. The bank was flagged by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in April 2022 for failing to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) mandates and violating rules for monitoring suspicious activity. The OCC said at the time that Anchorage Digital Bank failed to adopt a compliance program that met Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and AML protocols after being granted a conditional charter in January 2021. “The OCC holds all nationally chartered banks to the same high standards, whether they engage in traditional or novel activities,” then-Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu said in an April 2022 press release. “When institutions fall short, we will take action and hold them accountable to ensure compliance with federal laws and regulations.” Anchorage Digital Bank, which didn’t admit or deny the OCC’s findings, agreed to correct the issues, the OCC said at the time. In a January 2023 press release, the Anchorage Digital Bank said it had strengthened its team and revamped its BSA/AML and compliance programs. “We’ve also taken specific steps to enhance technology capabilities to enable monitoring transactions in a programmatic, scalable way,” the release said. “With our new technology platform, these hires and our continuous investment in staff, we will ensure that our institutional platform continues to maintain the security-first approach that has differentiated us from the beginning.” On Tuesday (April 8), Anchorage Digital Bank said it deepened its relationship with BlackRock to provide digital custody, becoming an additional custodian eligible to support spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) and other BlackRock funds providing exposure to crypto.

Title: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Says Tariffs Could Spook International Clients

Time Published: 2025-04-14T18:58:06Z

In recent days, Wall Street CEOs have offered various predictions about how the Trump administration’s tariff policy could impact their business abroad. Some have cautioned unavoidable fallout, while others claim their international dealings won’t be impacted. David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs (GS), appears to fall somewhere in the middle. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. “What we’re hearing from clients, particularly clients in Europe and other places around the world, is they don’t like the level of uncertainty,” said Solomon during the investment bank’s first-quarter earnings call today (April 14). When it comes to how this sentiment will play out for a global financial institution like Goldman Sachs, “it’s early to call heads or tails,” noted the CEO. Markets have been reeling since April 2, when President Donald Trump unveiled the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs—an across-the-board 10 percent levy, with additional “reciprocal” duties targeting countries based on their trade deficits. China, notably, has seen its tariffs raised to 145 percent, while most of the other reciprocal levies have been paused for 90 days. But tariff-induced anxieties remain. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), warned last week that his bank “will be in the crosshairs” as international clients and countries begin to feel differently about American financial institutions. Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick had a more positive take last week, saying he remains “bullish” on his firm’s global business. Solomon, meanwhile, believes it’s too soon to tell. While the executive told analysts today that international clients are currently “extremely engaged” with the bank and there isn’t a decline of business on the horizon, Solomon noted that short-term concerns are particularly pronounced outside of the U.S. In some ways, recent market volatility has been beneficial to Goldman Sachs. Heightened levels of uncertainty have spurred a rise in trading, driving up the bank’s equity trading revenue to $4.19 billion in the first three months of this year—a 27 percent year-over-year increase. Total revenue climbed 6 percent to $15.06 billion for the quarter, and profit rose 15 percent to $4.74 billion. Both figures beat estimates. Goldman shares rose 2.3 percent on the results today. At the close of 2024, Solomon predicted a surge in mergers and acquisitions under a renewed Trump administration. So far, the reality has been the opposite. Goldman Sachs’ latest earnings reveal a clear slowdown in dealmaking, with investment banking fees dropping 8 percent year-over-year to $1.91 billion. The bank’s deal backlog has grown for the fourth consecutive quarter, Solomon noted, though he added that “our ability to execute on these transactions will, of course, be dependent on market conditions.” Solomon, like other Wall Street leaders, has become increasingly worried about said market conditions leading to a broader economic downturn. During today’s earnings call, he warned that slowing economic activity around the globe means that “the prospect of a recession has increased.” Dimon echoed similar concerns last week, putting the odds of a recession this year at 50/50. Other finance titans, like Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock (BLK), have declared that the U.S. might already be in one. For the time being, Solomon is urging calm. “My guess is, over time, this level of uncertainty will come down,” he said. “My general message to people is to go slow and take a pause here until we have more clarity around a lot of these issues.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: MSC Founder Emerges as Key Player in $19B Global Ports Deal

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network MSC ships at the Port of Long Beach. Photo courtesy Port of Long Beach By Alessandra Migliaccio and Tara Patel Bloomberg) — Gianluigi Aponte, the secretive Italian billionaire who founded MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co SA, has emerged as a powerful broker in a $19 billion port deal with Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing. Aponte and his family-controlled Terminal Investment Ltd., known as TiL, are the main investors in a consortium that has proposed a $19 billion accord to buy 43 ports from Li’s CK Hutchison Holdings, people familiar with the matter have said. The grouping includes BlackRock Inc. and its Global Infrastructure Partners unit, which will control two of the ports in Panama. GIP also has a minority stake in TiL. The deal has thrust the 84-year-old Aponte into an uncharacteristically high-profile position while underscoring his firm’s increasingly dominant role in worldwide shipping. MSC has grown to control about a fifth of global shipping capacity, and Aponte has a net worth of $25.6 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The low-key Aponte, silver-haired and slight of build, rarely speaks in public or gives interviews. His closely held company doesn’t publish financial reports or strategy updates. Still, he’s a member of the exclusive club of ultra-wealthy European shipping magnates who earned huge windfalls during the pandemic, and who’ve been expanding their empires ever since. The group includes the Maersk-Uggla family behind Danish container line AP Moller-Maersk A/S, Klaus-Michael Kuehne, Germany’s richest man, who has a 30% stake in Hapag-Lloyd AG, and Rodolphe Saade and his family, who control CMA CGM SA. The Aponte family traces its seafaring roots back to 1675, according to its corporate website. Gianluigi Aponte was born near the Bay of Naples, where the family traditionally ferried goods and passengers. He trained as a ship’s captain and later operated ferries shuttling wealthy tourists to island resorts like Capri and Ischia. It was on one of those trips that he met his future wife, Rafaela Diamant, the daughter of a Swiss banker. Aponte started MSC in 1970 after purchasing an old German break-bulk ship, and the following year he bought a second vessel, naming it after his wife. He soon began buying secondhand container ships, some from scrapyards, as he looked to break into a business dominated by Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd. After carving out a niche on under-served routes, MSC eventually distinguished itself by emphasizing price over delivery speed. In the late 1980s Aponte made the jump into the leisure segment, and MSC Cruises became the world’s third-largest cruise brand. Like his European shipping peers, Aponte pushed heavily into ports and logistics. MSC’s pandemic-era profits fueled a further rapid expansion drive, and by 2022 it had achieved its founder’s goal of becoming the world’s biggest container carrier, dropping Maersk into second place. Aponte’s son Diego became MSC’s group president in 2014. Still, the senior Aponte remains highly active in MSC’s management as group chairman, with decision-making closely concentrated among the extended family, according to industry executives. Diego Aponte also heads the board of Geneva-based TiL where his father is a director, according to its website, which lists its shareholders as MSC, BlackRock’s GIP and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Italian tycoon — not BlackRock — emerges as lead investor in Panama ports deal: report

Italian tycoon Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run business – not BlackRock – will be the lead investor of a group trying to buy 43 global ports, including key Panama Canal locations, from a Hong Kong business magnate, according to a report. BlackRock, however, will gain control of the two Panama ports included in the roughly $19 billion deal, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Terminal Investment Ltd., or TiL – the Aponte family’s Geneva-based firm – will take over all but two of the ports from CK Hutchison, a Hong-Kong based conglomerate controlled by billionaire Li Ka-shing, according to the report. The sale, which is facing steep opposition from Beijing, is reportedly set to be made to a group including TiL, BlackRock and investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners. GIP, which BlackRock acquired last year, has a minority stake in the Aponte firm. TiL, BlackRock and CK Hutchison did not immediately respond to The Post’s requests for comment. However, the deal has faced considerable roadblocks as China pushes Li to scrap the sale, which offers desirable access to the Panama Canal — which President Trump has his eye on. Earlier this year, before BlackRock swooped in with a prospective deal, Trump suggested he would consider using military force to take control of the canal from Panama, arguing it’s “vital” for national security. His administration has since cheered the planned sale as a victory that will “take back” the waterway from Beijing. Meanwhile, an auditor employed by Panama’s government this month accused CK Hutchison of failing to renew its contract to operate the ports, claiming it owed the government $300 million. As for the deal, talks are still ongoing and details on the final structure may still change, sources told Bloomberg. BlackRock’s GIP will own 51% of the two Panama ports, while TiL will take 49%, according to Bloomberg. These facilities account for about 4% of the total value of the deal, sources said. BlackRock and GLC Pte, a Singaporean sovereign wealth fund, have a combined minority ownership of about 30% in TiL, sources told the outlet. The Aponte business was chosen for the deal, which had been open to several bidders, in part because of the family’s close ties to Li, sources told Bloomberg. CK Hutchison thought the ports would be in good hands with TiL, which operates more than 70 container terminals across 31 countries, they added. The port deal is still pending due diligence, tax and accounting checks, as well as approval from regulators, according to Bloomberg. And it has already faced delays. BlackRock was scheduled to sign an agreement by April 2, which has been postponed. Advertisement

Brian Witte, Associated Press Brian Witte, Associated Press Barbara Ortutay, Associated Press Barbara Ortutay, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — A historic antitrust trial began Monday for Meta Platforms Inc. in a case that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The trial is bringing Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg into federal court in Washington to testify. In opening statements, Federal Trade Commission attorney Daniel Matheson said Meta has used a monopoly to generate enormous profits as consumer satisfaction has dropped. He said Meta was “erecting a moat” to protect its interests by buying the two startups because the company feared they were a threat to Meta’s dominance. Zuckerberg and other Meta witnesses will testify during the trial. “We’re going to give them their chance to tell their side of the story,” Matheson said. Mark Hansen, an attorney for Meta, said the FTC was making a “grab bag” of arguments that were wrong. He said Meta has plenty of competition and has made improvements to the startups it acquired. “This lawsuit, in summary, is misguided,” Hansen said, adding: “anyway you look at it, consumers have been the big winners.” The trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump’s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. READ MORE: Meta agrees to pay $25 million settlement to Trump over Jan. 6 suspension lawsuit Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s strategy, “expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. “Unable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company’s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,” the FTC says. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750 million after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta’s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. “The FTC already has the difficult task, whether it’s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we’re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,” said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. “And I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.” Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC’s lawsuit “defies reality.” “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,” the company said in a statement. In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC “must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.” This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta’s fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta’s request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. Boasberg “seems to be skeptical” of the FTC’s narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a “fact question,” which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it’s forced to spin off Instagram. Meta isn’t the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google’s case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August. “A big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it’s an open question whether the judge-made developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing — these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,” Swanson said. “And this will be a case that speaks directly to that.” Your tax-deductible donation ensures our vital reporting continues to thrive.

Title: More than 60% of CEOs expect a recession in the next 6 months as tariff turmoil grows, survey says

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time A growing majority of America’s top executives now expects the U.S. economy to enter a recession in the near future, according to a survey released Monday. Of the more than 300 CEOs polled in April, 62% said they forecasted a recession or other economic downturn in the next six months, according to Chief Executive, an industry group that runs the survey. That’s up from 48% who said the same in March. Chief Executive’s data underscores the growing concern within corporate America around the future of the U.S. economy. Fears about a forthcoming recession hit a boiling point in the last two weeks, as President Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again tariff policy ratcheted up volatility in financial markets and stirred panic among some consumers. Indeed, around three-fourths of CEOs surveyed said tariffs would hurt their businesses in 2025. About two-thirds said they did not support Trump’s proposed levies, many of which are currently on pause. The monthly survey, which has run since 2002, includes several data points that paint a concerning picture of how America’s foremost business leaders view the economy. An index of CEOs’ views on current business conditions tumbled 9% in April, continuing its decline after plunging 20% in the prior month. The measure now sits at its lowest level since the early months of the pandemic in 2020. When forecasting business conditions a year out, CEOs held their view steady from March. Still, these readings were the lowest since late 2012 and have tanked around 29% from the end of 2024. The survey found that more than four out of five chief executives project costs spiking this year, which is no surprise given the ongoing negotiations over import taxes between the White House and foreign countries. Around half forecast their percentage increases in expenses to be in the double digits. In this vein, just 37% said they believe their companies’ profits will increase. That’s a steep drop from the 76% who gave this response in January. To be sure, Chief Executive’s data set included a few bright spots. Slightly over half of respondents said they foresee business conditions bettering over the next year, an increase from the 39% share seen a month earlier. Many CEOs may be getting some tariff relief as well. Trump late Friday announced that smartphones and PCs would be exempt from duties, though Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that these exemptions would be temporary. Chief Executive’s data comes as U.S. business leaders have started flashing warning signs on the country’s economic future. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Friday that he expects earnings estimates for S&P 500 firms to fall due to the uncertainty around Trump’s levies. Also on Friday, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warned that the U.S. economy may have already weakened to the point of growth coming in negative. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Fink said on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Share this article The US Department of Homeland Security’s El Dorado Task Force has launched an investigation into Anchorage Digital Bank, the first and only chartered digital asset bank in the US, Barron’s reported Monday, citing sources with knowledge of the matter. The task force, which focuses on combating money laundering and other financial crimes, has contacted former Anchorage employees as part of its investigation. However, the details of the probe are currently unknown. Anchorage Digital is a recognized name in the digital asset space, having partnered with major institutions like Cantor Fitzgerald, previously headed by Howard Lutnick, who currently serves as commerce secretary under the Trump administration, and also with BlackRock. Last November, Cantor Fitzgerald established a partnership with Anchorage and Copper to act as collateral managers and custodians for its new global Bitcoin financing business. The collaboration aims to offer top-tier digital asset custody services, starting with $2 billion in initial financing. BlackRock has recently tapped the bank for its spot crypto ETF custody. The fund management giant offers two spot ETFs tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the IBIT and ETHA funds. As of March 31, BlackRock’s spot crypto ETFs had around $50 billion in assets under management, according to its Q1 earnings report. This isn’t the first time Anchorage Digital has encountered regulatory scrutiny. In 2022, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) took action against its banking arm for failing to meet BSA/AML obligations under its operating agreement.

Title: OpenAI Is a Systemic Risk to the Tech Industry

Before we go any further: I hate to ask you to do this, but I need your help — I'm up for this year's Webbys for the best business podcast award. I know it's a pain in the ass, but can you sign up and vote for Better Offline? I have never won an award in my life, so help me win this one. Soundtrack: Mastodon - High Road I wanted to start this newsletter with a pithy anecdote about chaos, both that caused by Donald Trump's tariffs and the brittle state of the generative AI bubble. Instead, I am going to write down some questions, and make an attempt to answer them. Last week, OpenAI closed "the largest private tech funding round in history," where it "raised" an astonishing "$40 billion," and the reason that I've put quotation marks around it is that OpenAI has only raised $10 billion of the $40 billion, with the rest arriving by "the end of the year." The remaining $30 billion — $20 billion of which will (allegedly) be provided by SoftBank — is partially contingent on OpenAI's conversion from a non-profit to a for-profit by the end of 2025, and if it fails, SoftBank will only give OpenAI a further $20 billion. The round also valued OpenAI at $300 billion. To put that in context, OpenAI had revenues of $4bn in 2024. This deal values OpenAI at 75 times its revenue. That’s a bigger gulf than Tesla at its peak market cap — a company that was, in fact, worth more than all other legacy car manufacturers combined, despite making far less than them, and shipping a fraction of their vehicles. I also want to add that, as of writing this sentence, this money is yet to arrive. SoftBank's filings say that the money will arrive mid-April — and that SoftBank would be borrowing as much as $10 billion to finance the round, with the option to syndicate part of it to other investors. For the sake of argument, I'm going to assume this money actually arrives. Filings also suggest that "in certain circumstances" the second ($30 billion) tranche could arrive "in early 2026." This isn't great. It also seems that SoftBank's $10 billion commitment is contingent on getting a loan, "...financed through borrowings from Mizuho Bank, Ltd., among other financial institutions." OpenAI also revealed it now has 20 million paying subscribers and over 500 million weekly active users. If you're wondering why it doesn’t talk about monthly active users, it's because they'd likely be much higher than 500 million, which would reveal exactly how poorly OpenAI converts free ChatGPT users to paying ones, and how few people use ChatGPT in their day-to-day lives. The Information reported back in January that OpenAI was generating $25 million in revenue a month from its $200-a-month "Pro" subscribers (it still loses money on every one of them), suggesting around 125,000 ChatGPT Pro subscribers. Assuming the other 19,875,000 users are paying $20 a month, that puts its revenue at about $423 million a month, or about $5 billion a year, from ChatGPT subscriptions. This is what reporters mean when they say "annualized revenue" by the way — it's literally the monthly revenue multiplied by 12. Bloomberg reported recently that OpenAI expects its 2025 revenue to "triple" to $12.7 billion this year. Assuming a similar split of revenue to 2024, this would require OpenAI to nearly double its annualized subscription revenue from Q1 2025 (from $5 billion to around $9.27 billion) and nearly quadruple API revenue (from 2024's revenue of $1 billion, which includes Microsoft's 20% payment for access to OpenAI's models, to $3.43 billion). While these are messy numbers, it's unclear how OpenAI intends to pull this off. The Information reported in February that it planned to do so by making $3 billion a year selling "agents," with ChatGPT subscriptions ($7.9 billion) and API calls ($1.8 billion) making up the rest. This, of course, is utter bollocks. OpenAI's "agents" can't do even the simplest tasks, and three billion dollars of the $12.7 billion figure appears to be a commitment made by SoftBank to purchase OpenAI's tech for its various subsidiaries and business units. Let's say out the numbers precisely: We can assume, in this case, that OpenAI likely has, in the best case scenario, access to roughly $16 billion in liquidity at any given time. It's reasonable to believe that OpenAI will raise more debt this year, and I'd estimate it does so to the tune of around $5 billion or $6 billion. Without it, I am not sure what it’s going to do. As a reminder: OpenAI loses money on every single user. When I wrote "How Does OpenAI Survive?" and "OpenAI Is A Bad Business," I used reported information to explain how this company was, at its core, unsustainable. Let's refresh our memories. It seems, from even a cursory glance, that OpenAI's costs are increasing dramatically. The Information reported earlier in the year that OpenAI projects to spend $13 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2025, nearly tripling what it spent in total on compute in 2024 ($5 billion). This suggests that OpenAI's costs are skyrocketing, and that was before the launch of its new image generator which led to multiple complaints from Altman about a lack of available GPUs, leading to OpenAI's CEO saying to expect "stuff to break" and delays in new products. Nevertheless, even if we assume OpenAI factored in the compute increases into its projections, it still expects to pay Microsoft $13 billion for compute this year. This number, however, doesn't include the $12.9 billion five-year-long compute deal signed with CoreWeave, a deal that was a result of Microsoft declining to pick up the option to buy said compute itself. Payments for this deal, according to The Information, start in October 2025, and assuming that it's evenly paid (the terms of these contracts are generally secret, even in the case of public companies), this would still amount to roughly $2.38 billion a year. However, for the sake of argument, let's consider the payments are around $198 million a month, though there are scenarios — such as, say, CoreWeave's buildout partner not being able to build the data centers or CoreWeave not having the money to pay to build them — where OpenAI might pay less. To be clear, and I’ll explain in greater detail later, this wouldn’t be a good thing, either. While it would be off the hook for some of its payments, it would also be without the compute that’s essential for it to continue growing, serving existing customers, and building new AI models. Cash and compute are both essential to OpenAI’s survival. OpenAI has dedicated somewhere in the region of $19 billion to the Stargate data center project, along with another $19 billion provided by SoftBank and an indeterminate amount by other providers. Based on reporting from Bloomberg, OpenAI plans to have 64,000 Blackwell GPUs running "by the end of 2026," or roughly $3.84 billion worth of them. I should also note that Bloomberg said that 16,000 of these chips would be operational by Summer 2025, though it's unclear if that will actually happen. Though it's unclear who actually pays for what parts of Stargate, it's safe to assume that OpenAI will have to, at the very least, put a billion dollars into a project that is meant to be up and running by the end of 2026, if not more. As of now, Stargate has exactly one data center under development in Abilene, Texas, and as above, it's unclear how that's going, though a recent piece from The Information reported that it was currently "empty and incomplete," and that if it stays that way, "OpenAI could walk away from the deal, which would cost Oracle billions of dollars." Though the article takes pains to assure the reader that won't be likely, even an inkling of such a possibility is a bad sign. Business Insider's reporting on the site in Abilene calls it a "$3.4 billion data center development" (as did the press release from site developer Crusoe), though these numbers don't include GPUs, hardware, or the labor necessary to run them. Right now, Crusoe is (according to Business Insider) building "six new data centers, each with a minimum square footage...[which will] join the two it is already constructing for Oracle." Oracle has signed, according to The Information, a 15-year-long lease with Crusoe for its data centers, all of which will be rented to OpenAI. In any case, OpenAI’s exposure could be much, much higher than the $1bn posited at the start of this section (and I’ll explain in greater depth how I reached that figure at the bottom of this section). If OpenAI has to contribute significantly to the costs associated with building Stargate, it could be on the hook for billions. Data Center Dynamics reports that the Abilene site is meant to have 200MW of compute capacity in the first half of 2025, and then as much as 1.2GW by "mid-2026." To give you a sense of total costs for this project, former Microsoft VP of Energy Brian Janous said in January that it costs about $25 million a megawatt (or $25 billion a gigawatt), meaning that the initial capital expenditures for Stargate to spin up its first 200MW data center will be around $5 billion, spiraling to $30 billion for the entire project. Or perhaps even more. The Information has reported that the site, which could be "...potentially one of the world's biggest AI data centers," could cost "$50 billion to $100 billion in the coming years." Assuming we stick with the lower end of the cost estimates, it’s likely that OpenAI is on the hook for over $5 billion for the Abilene site based on the $19 billion it has agreed to contribute to the entire Stargate project, the (often disagreeing) cost projections of the facility), and the contributions of other partners. This expenditure won’t come all at once, and will be spread across several years. Still, assuming even the rosiest numbers, it's hard to see how OpenAI doesn't have to pony up $1 billion in 2025, with similar annual payments going forward until its completion, and that is likely because the development of this site is going to be heavily delayed by both tariffs, labor shortages, and Oracle's (as reported by The Information) trust in "scrappy but unproven startups to develop the project." Based on reporting from The Information last year, OpenAI will spend at least $2.5 billion across salaries, "data" (referring to buying data from other companies), hosting and other cost of sales, and sales and marketing, and then another billion on what infrastructure OpenAI owns. I expect the latter cost to balloon with OpenAI's investment in physical infrastructure for Stargate. Based on previous estimates, OpenAI spends about $2.25 to make $1. At that rate, it's likely that OpenAI's costs in its rosiest revenue projections of $12.7 billion are at least $28 billion — meaning that it’s on course to burn at least $14 billion in 2025. Assuming that OpenAI has all of its liquidity from last year (it doesn't, but for sake of argument, let’s pretend it still has the full $10 billion), as well as the $10 billion from SoftBank, it is still unclear how it meets its obligations. While OpenAI likely has preferential payment structures with all vendors, such as its discounted rates with Microsoft for Azure cloud services, it will still have to pay them, especially in the case of costs related to Stargate, many of which will be up-front costs. In the event that its costs are as severe as reporting suggests, it’s likely the company will find itself needing to raise more capital — whether through equity (or the weird sort-of equity that it issues) or through debt. And yes, while OpenAI has some revenue, it comes at a terrible cost, and anything that isn’t committed to paying for salaries and construction fees will likely be immediately funnelled directly into funding the obscene costs behind inference and training models like GPT 4.5 — a "giant expensive model" to run that the company has nevertheless pushed to every user. Worse still, OpenAI has, while delaying its next model (GPT-5), promised to launch its o3 reasoning model after saying it wouldn't do so, which is strange, because it turns out that o3 is actually way more expensive to run than people thought. Reasoning models are almost always more expensive to operate, as they involve the model “checking” its work, which, in turn, requires more calculations and more computation. Still, o3 is ludicrously expensive even for this category, with the Arc Prize Foundation (a non-profit that makes the ARC-AGI test for benchmarking models) estimating that it will cost $30,000 a task. As of right now, SoftBank has committed to the following: SoftBank's exposure to OpenAI is materially harming the company. To quote the Wall Street Journal: While one might argue that SoftBank has a good amount of cash, the Journal also adds that it’s somewhat hamstrung in its use as a result of CEO Masayoshi Son's reckless gambles: Worse still, it seems, as mentioned before, that SoftBank will be financing the entirety of the first $10 billion — or $7.5 billion, assuming it finds investors to syndicate the first tranche, and they follow through right until the moment Masayoshi Son hits ‘send’ on the wire transfer . As a result, SoftBank will likely have to start selling off parts of its valuable holdings in companies like Alibaba and ARM, or, worse still, parts of its ailing investments from its Vision Fund, resulting in a material loss on its underwater deals. This is an untenable strategy, and I'll explain why. While we do not have much transparency into OpenAI's actual day-to-day finances, we can make the educated guess that its costs are increasing based on the amount of capital it’s raising. If OpenAI’s costs were flat, or only mildly increasing, we’d expect to see raises roughly the same size as previous ones. Its $40bn raise is nearly six times the previous funding round. Admittedly, multiples like that aren’t particularly unusual. If a company raises $300,000 in a pre-seed round, and $3m in a Series A round, that’s a tenfold increase. But we’re not talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions of dollars. We’re talking about billions of dollars. If OpenAI’s funding round with Softbank goes as planned, it’ll raise the equivalent of the entire GDP of Estonia — a fairly wealthy country itself, and one that’s also a member of Nato and the European Union. That alone should give you a sense of the truly insane scale of this. Insane, sure, but undoubtedly necessary. Per The Information, OpenAI expects to spend as much as $28 billion in compute on Microsoft's Azure cloud in 2028. Over a third of OpenAI's revenue, per the same article, will come from SoftBank's (alleged) spend.It's reasonable to believe that OpenAI will, as a result, need to raise in excess of $40 billion in funding a year, though it's reasonable to believe that it will need to raise more along the lines of $50 billion or more a year until it reaches profitability. This is due to both its growing cost of business, as well as its various infrastructure commitments, both in terms of Stargate, as well as with third-party suppliers like CoreWeave and Microsoft. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's statements around costs also suggest that they're increasing. In late February, Altman claimed that OpenAI was "out of GPUs." While this suggests that there’s demand for some products — like its image-generating tech, which enjoyed a viral day in the sun in March — it also means that to meet the demand it needs to spend more. And, at the risk of repeating myself, that demand doesn’t necessarily translate into profitability. As discussed above, SoftBank has to overcome significant challenges to fund both OpenAI and Stargate, and when I say "fund," I mean fund the current state of both projects, assuming no further obligations. The Information reports that OpenAI forecasts that it will spend $28 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2028. The same article also reports that OpenAI "would turn profitable by the end of the decade after the buildout of Stargate," suggesting that OpenAI's operating expenses will grow exponentially year-over-year. These costs, per The Information, are astronomical: SoftBank has had to (and will continue having to) go to remarkable lengths to fund OpenAI's current ($40 billion) round, lengths so significant that it may lead to its credit rating being further downgraded. Even if we assume the best case scenario — OpenAI successfully converts to a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and receives the full $30 billion — it seems unlikely (if not impossible) for it to continue raising the amount of capital they need to continue operations. As I’ve argued in previous newsletters, there are only a few entities that can provide the kinds of funding that OpenAI needs. These include big tech-focused investment firms like Softbank, sovereign wealth funds (like those of Saudi Arabia and the United Emirates), and perhaps the largest tech companies. These entities can meet OpenAI’s needs, but not all the time. It’s not realistic to expect Softbank, or Microsoft, or the Saudis, or Oracle, or whoever, to provide $40bn every year for the foreseeable future. This is especially true for Softbank. Based on its current promise to not borrow more than 25% of its holdings, it is near-impossible that SoftBank will be able to continue funding OpenAI at this rate ($40 billion a year), and $40 billion a year may not actually be enough. Based on its last reported equity value of holdings, SoftBank's investments and other assets are worth around $229 billion, meaning that it can borrow just over $57bn while remaining compliant with these guidelines. In any case, it is unclear how SoftBank can fund OpenAI, but it's far clearer that nobody else is willing to. Before we go any further, it's important to note that OpenAI does not really have its own compute infrastructure. The majority of its compute is provided by Microsoft, though, as mentioned above, OpenAI now has a deal with CoreWeave to take over Microsoft's future options for more capacity. Anyway, in the last 90 days, Sam Altman has complained about a lack of GPUs and pressure on OpenAI's servers multiple times. Forgive me for repeating stuff from above, but this is necessary. These statements, in a bubble, seem either harmless or like OpenAI's growth is skyrocketing — the latter of which might indeed be true, but bodes ill for a company that burns money on every single user. Any mention of rate limits or performance issues suggests that OpenAI is having significant capacity issues, and at this point it's unclear what further capacity it can actually expand to outside of that currently available. Remember, Microsoft has now pulled out of as much as 2GW of data center projects, walked away from a $1 billion data center development in Ohio, and declined the option on $12bn of compute from CoreWeave that OpenAI had to pick up — meaning that it may be pushing up against the limits of what is physically available. While the total available capacity of GPUs at many providers like Lambda and Crusoe is unknown, we know that CoreWeave has approximately 360MWavailable, compared to Microsoft's 6.5 to 7.5 Gigawatts, a large chunk of which already powers OpenAI. If OpenAI is running into capacity issues, it could be one of the following: Per The Information's reporting, Microsoft "promised OpenAI 300,000 NVIDIA GB200 (Blackwell) chips by the end of 2025," or roughly $18 billion of chips. It's unclear if this has changed since Microsoft allowed OpenAI to seek other compute in late January 2025. I also don't believe that OpenAI has any other viable options for existing compute infrastructure outside of Microsoft. CoreWeave's current data centers mostly feature NVIDIA's aging "Hopper" GPUs, and while it could — and likely is! — retrofitting its current infrastructure with Blackwell chips, doing so is not easy. Blackwell chips require far more powerful cooling and server infrastructure to make them run smoothly (a problem which led to a delay in their delivery to most customers), and even if CoreWeave was able to replace every last Hopper GPU with Blackwell (it won't), it still wouldn't match what OpenAI needs to expand. One might argue that it simply needs to wait for the construction of the Stargate data center, or for CoreWeave to finish the gigawatt or so of construction it’s working on. As I've previously written, I have serious concerns over the viability of CoreWeave ever completing its (alleged) contracted 1.3 Gigawatts of capacity. Per my article: However, even if I were to humour the idea, it is impossible that any of this project is done by the end of the year, or even in 2026. I can find no commitments to any timescale, other than the fact that OpenAI will allegedly start paying CoreWeave in October (per The Information), which could very well be using current capacity. I can also find no evidence that Crusoe, the company building the Stargate data center, has any compute available. Lambda, a GPU compute company that raised $320 million earlier in this year, and according to Data Center Dynamics "operates out of colocation data centers in San Francisco, California, and Allen, Texas, and is backed by more than $820 million in funds raised just this year," suggesting that it may not have their own data centers at all. Its ability to scale is entirely contingent on the availability of whatever data center providers it has relationships with. In any case, this means that OpenAI's only real choice for GPUs is CoreWeave or Microsoft. While it's hard to calculate precisely, OpenAI's best case scenario is that 16,000 GPUs come online in the summer of 2025 as part of the Stargate data center project. That's a drop in the bucket compared to the 300,000 Blackwell GPUs that Microsoft had previously promised. OpenAI is, regardless of how you or I may feel about generative AI, one of the fastest-growing companies of all time. It currently has, according to its own statements, 500 million weekly active users. Putting aside that each user is unprofitable, such remarkable growth — especially as it's partially a result of its extremely resource-intensive image generator — is also a strain on its infrastructure. The vast majority of OpenAI's users are free customers using ChatGPT, with only around 20 million paying subscribers, and the vast majority on the cheapest $20 plan. OpenAI's services — even in the case of image generation — are relatively commoditized, meaning that users can, if they really care, go and use any number of other different Large Language Model services. They can switch to Bing Image Creator, or Grok, or Stable Diffusion, or whatever. Free users are also a burden on the company — especially with such a piss-poor conversion rate — losing it money with each prompt (which is also the case with paying customers), and the remarkable popularity of its image generation service only threatens to bring more burdensome one-off customers that will generate a few abominable Studio Ghibli pictures and then never return. If OpenAI's growth continues at this rate, it will run into capacity issues, and it does not have much room to expand. While we do not know how much capacity it’s taking up with Microsoft, or indeed whether Microsoft is approaching capacity or otherwise limiting how much of it OpenAI can take, we do know that OpenAI has seen reason to beg for access to more GPUs. In simpler terms, even if OpenAI wasn’t running out of money, even if OpenAI wasn’t horrifyingly unprofitable, it also may not have enough GPUs to continue providing its services in a reliable manner. If that's the case, there really isn't much that can be done to fix it other than: The problem is that these measures, even if they succeed in generating more money for the company, also need to reduce the burden on OpenAI's available infrastructure. Remember: data centers can take three to six years to build, and even with the Stargate's accelerated (and I'd argue unrealistic) timelines, OpenAI isn't even unlocking a tenth of Microsoft's promised compute (16,000 GPUs online this year versus the 300,000 GPUs promised by Microsoft). Though downtime might be an obvious choice, capacity issues at OpenAI will likely manifest in hard limits on what free users can do, some of which I've documented above. Nevertheless, I believe the real pale horses of capacity issues come from arbitrary limits on any given user group, meaning both free and paid users. Sudden limits on what a user can do — a reduction in the number of generations of images of videos for paid users, any introduction of "peak hours," or any increases in prices are a sign that OpenAI is running out of GPUs, which it has already publicly said is happening. However, the really obvious one would be service degradation — delays in generations of any kind, 500 status code errors, or ChatGPT failing to fully produce an answer. OpenAI has, up until this point, had fairly impressive uptime. Still, if it is running up against a wall, this streak will end. The consequences depend on how often these issues occur, and to whom they occur. If free users face service degradation, they will bounce off the product, as their use is likely far more fleeting than a paid user, which will begin to erode OpenAI's growth. Ironically, rapid (and especially unprecedented) growth in one of OpenAI’s competitors, like xAI or Anthropic, could also represent a pale horse for OpenAI. If paid users face service degradation, it's likely this will cause the most harm to the company, as while paid users still lose OpenAI money in the end, it at least receives some money in exchange. OpenAI has effectively one choice here: getting more GPUs from Microsoft, and its future depends heavily both on its generosity and there being enough of them at a time when Microsoft has pulled back from two gigawatts of data centers specifically because of it moving away from providing compute for OpenAI. Admittedly, OpenAI has previously spent more on training models than inference (actually running them) and the company might be able to smooth downtime issues by shifting capacity. This would, of course, have a knock-on effect on its ability to continue developing new models, and the company is already losing ground, particularly when it comes to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. As part of its deal with SoftBank, OpenAI must convert its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit entity by December 2025, or it’ll lose $10 billion from its promised funding. Furthermore, in the event that OpenAI fails to convert to a for-profit by October 2026, investors in its previous $6.6 billion round can claw back their investment, with it converting into a loan with an attached interest rate. Naturally, this represents a nightmare scenario for the company, as it’ll increase both its costs and its outgoings. This is a complex situation that almost warrants its own newsletter, but the long and short of it is that OpenAI would have to effectively dissolve itself, start the process of forming an entirely new entity, and distribute its assets to other nonprofits (or sell/license them to the for-profit company at fair market rates). It would require valuing OpenAI's assets, which in and of itself would be a difficult task, as well as getting past the necessary state regulators, the IRS, state revenue agencies, and the upcoming trial with Elon Musk only adds further problems. I’ve simplified things here, and that’s because (as I said) this stuff is complex. Suffice to say, this isn’t as simple as liquidating a company and starting afresh, or submitting a couple of legal filings. It’s a long, fraught process and one that will be — and has been — subject to legal challenges, both from OpenAI’s business rivals, as well as from civil society organizations in California. Based on discussions with experts in the field and my own research, I simply do not know how OpenAI pulls this off by October 2026, let alone by the end of the year. OpenAI has become a load-bearing company for the tech industry, both as a narrative — as previously discussed, ChatGPT is the only Large Language Model company with any meaningful userbase — and as a financial entity. Its ability to meet its obligations and its future expansion plans are critical to the future health — or, in some cases, survival — of multiple large companies, and that's before the after-effects that will affect its customers as a result of any financial collapse. The parallels to the 2007-2008 financial crisis are startling. Lehman Brothers wasn’t the largest investment bank in the world (although it was certainly big), just like OpenAI isn’t the largest tech company (though, again, it’s certainly large in terms of market cap and expenditure). Lehman Brothers’ collapse sparked a contagion that would later spread throughout the global financial services industry, and consequently, the global economy. I can see OpenAI’s failure having a similar systemic effect. While there is a vast difference between OpenAI’s involvement in people’s lives compared to the millions of subprime loans issued to real people, the stock market’s dependence on the value of the Magnificent 7 stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, NVIDIA and Tesla), and in turn the Magnificent 7’s reliance on the stability of the AI boom narrative still threatens material harm to millions of people, and that’s before the ensuing layoffs. And as I’ve said before, this entire narrative is based off of OpenAI’s success, because OpenAI is the generative AI industry. I want to lay out the direct result of any kind of financial crisis at OpenAI, because I don't think anybody is taking this seriously. Per The Information, Oracle, which has taken responsibility for organizing the construction of the Stargate data centers with unproven data center builder Crusoe, "...may need to raise more capital to fund its data center ambitions." Oracle has signed a 15-year lease with Crusoe, and, to quote The Information, "...is on the hook for $1 billion in payments to that firm." To further quote The Information: In simpler terms, Oracle is building a giant data center for one customer — OpenAI — and has taken on the financial burden associated with it. If OpenAI fails to expand, or lacks the capital to actually pay for its share of the Stargate project, Oracle is on the hook for at least a billion dollars, and, based on The Information's reporting, is also on the hook to buy the GPUs for the site. In reality, this development will likely cost tens of billions of dollars, $19 billion of which is due from OpenAI, which does not have the money until it receives its second tranche of funding in December 2025, which is contingent partially on its ability to convert into a for-profit entity, which, as mentioned, is a difficult and unlikely proposition. It's unclear how many of the Blackwell GPUs that Oracle has had to purchase in advance, but in the event of any kind of financial collapse at OpenAI, Oracle would likely take a loss of at least a billion dollars, if not several billion dollars. I have written a lot about publicly-traded AI compute firm CoreWeave, and it would be my greatest pleasure to never mention it again. Nevertheless, I have to. The Financial Times revealed a few weeks ago that CoreWeave's debt payments could balloon to over $2.4 billion a year by the end of 2025, far outstripping its cash reserves, and The Information reported that its cash burn would increase to $15 billion in 2025. As per its IPO filings, 62% of CoreWeave's 2024 revenue (a little under $2 billion, with losses of $863 million) was Microsoft compute, and based on conversations with sources, a good amount of this was Microsoft running compute for OpenAI. Starting October 2025, OpenAI will start paying Coreweave as part of its five-year-long $12 billion contract, picking up the option that Microsoft declined. This is also when CoreWeave will have to start making payments on its massive, multi-billion dollar DDTL 2.0 loan, which likely makes these payments critical to CoreWeave's future. This deal also suggests that OpenAI will become CoreWeave's largest customer. Microsoft had previously committed to spending $10 billion on CoreWeave's services "by the end of the decade," but CEO Satya Nadella added a few months later on a podcast that its relationship with CoreWeave was a "one-time thing." Assuming Microsoft keeps spending at its previous rate — something that isn't guaranteed — it would still be only half of OpenAI's potential revenue. CoreWeave's expansion, at this point, is entirely driven by OpenAI. 77% of its 2024 revenue came from two customers — Microsoft being the largest, and using CoreWeave as an auxiliary supplier of compute for OpenAI. As a result, the future expansion efforts — the theoretical 1.3 gigawatts of contracted (translation: does not exist yet) compute — are largely (if not entirely) for the benefit of OpenAI. In the event that OpenAI cannot fulfil its obligations, CoreWeave will collapse. It is that simple. I’m basing this on a comment I received from Gil Luria, Managing Director and Head of Technology Research at analyst D.A. Davidson & Co: CoreWeave receives preferential access to NVIDIA's GPUs, and makes up billions of dollars of its revenue. CoreWeave then takes those GPUs and raises debt using them as collateral, then proceeds to buy more of those GPUs from NVIDIA. NVIDIA was the anchor for CoreWeave's IPO, and CEO Michael Intrator said that the IPO "wouldn't have closed" without NVIDIA buying $250 million worth of shares. NVIDIA invested $100 million in the early days of CoreWeave, and, for reasons I cannot understand, also agreed to spend $1.3 billion over four years to, and I quote The Information, "rent its own chips from CoreWeave." Buried in CoreWeave's S-1 — the document every company publishes before going public — was a warning about counterparty credit risk, which is when one party provides services or goods to another with specific repayment terms, and the other party not meeting their side of the deal. While this was written as a theoretical (as it could, in theoretically, come from any company to which CoreWeave acts as a creditor) it only named one company: OpenAI. As discussed previously, CoreWeave is saying that, should a customer — any customer, but really, it means OpenAI — fail to pay its bills for infrastructure built on their behalf, or for services rendered, it could have a material risk to the business. CoreWeave's continued ability to do business hinges heavily on its ability to raise further debt (which I have previously called into question), and its ability to raise further debt is, to quote the Financial Times, "secured against its more than 250,000 Nvidia chips and its contracts with customers, such as Microsoft." Any future debt that CoreWeave raises would be based upon its contract with OpenAI (you know, the counterparty credit risk threat that represents a disproportionate share of its revenue) and whatever GPUs it still has to collateralize. As a result, a chunk of NVIDIA's future revenue is dependent on OpenAI's ability to fulfil its obligations to CoreWeave, both in its ability to pay them and their timeliness in doing so. If OpenAI fails, then CoreWeave fails, which then hurts NVIDIA. Contagion. With Microsoft's data center pullback and OpenAI's intent to become independent from Redmond, future data center expansion is based on two partners supporting CoreWeave and Oracle: Crusoe and Core Scientific, neither of which appear to have ever built an AI data center. I also must explain how difficult building a data center is, and how said difficulty increases when you're building an AI-focused data center. For example, NVIDIA had to delay the launch of its Blackwell GPUs because of how finicky the associated infrastructure (the accompanying servers and cooling them) is. For customers that already had experience handling GPUs, and therefore likely know how to manage the extreme temperatures created by them. As another reminder, OpenAI is on the hook for $19 billion of funding behind Stargate, money that neither it nor SoftBank has right now. Imagine if you didn't have any experience, and effectively had to learn from scratch? How do you think that would go? We're about to find out! Crusoe is a former cryptocurrency mining company that has now raised hundreds of millions of dollars to build data centers for AI companies, starting with a $3.4 billion data center financing deal with asset manager Blue Owl Capital. This (yet-to-be-completed) data center has now been leased by Oracle, which will, allegedly, fill it full of GPUs for OpenAI. Despite calling itself "the industry’s first vertically integrated AI infrastructure provider," with the company using flared gas (a waste byproduct of oil production) to power IT infrastructure, Crusoe does not appear to have built an AI data center, and is now being tasked with building a 1.2 Gigawatt data center campus for OpenAI. Crusoe is the sole developer and operator of the Abilene site, meaning, according to The Information, "...is in charge of contracting with construction contractors and data center customers, as well as running the data center after it is built." Oracle, it seems, will be responsible for filling said data center with GPUs and the associated hardware. Nevertheless, the project appears to be behind schedule. The Information reported in October 2024 that Abeline was meant to have "...50,000 of NVIDIA's [Blackwell] AI chips...in the first quarter of [2025]," and also suggested that the site was projected to have 100,000 Blackwell chips by the end of 2025. Here in reality, a report from Bloomberg in March 2025 (that I cited previously) said that OpenAI and Oracle were expected to have 16,000 GPUs available by the Summer of 2025, with "...OpenAI and oracle are expected to deploy 64,000 NVIDIA GB200s at the Stargate data center...by the end of 2026." As discussed above, OpenAI needs this capacity. According to The Information, OpenAI expects Stargate to handle three-quarters of its compute by 2030, and these delays call into question at the very least whether this schedule is reasonable, if not whether Stargate, as a project, is actually possible. I've written a great deal about CoreWeave in the past, and specifically about its buildout partner Core Scientific, a cryptocurrency mining company (yes, another one) that has exactly one customer for AI data centers — CoreWeave. A few notes: Core Scientific is also, it seems, taking on $1.14 billion of capital expenditures to build out these data centers, with CoreWeave promising to reimburse $899.3 million of these costs. It's also unclear how Core Scientific intends to do this. While it’s taken on a good amount of debt in the past — $550 million in a convertible note toward the end of 2024 — this would be more debt than it’s ever taken on. It also, as with Crusoe, does not appear to have any experience building AI data centers, except unlike Crusoe, Core Scientific is a barely-functioning recently-bankrupted bitcoin miner pretending to be a data center company. How important is CoreWeave to OpenAI exactly? From Semafor: But will it survive long term? Going back to the point of contagion: If OpenAI fails, and CoreWeave fails, so too does Core Scientific. And I don’t fancy Crusoe’s chances, either. At least Crusoe isn’t public. Up until fairly recently, Microsoft has been the entire infrastructural backbone of OpenAI, but recently (to free OpenAI up to work with Oracle) released it from its exclusive cloud compute deal. Nevertheless, per The Information, OpenAI still intends to spend $13 billion on compute on Microsoft Azure this year. What's confusing, however, is whether any of this is booked as revenue. Microsoft claimed earlier in this year that it surpassed $13 billion in annual recurring revenue — by which it means its last month multiplied by 12 — from artificial intelligence. OpenAI's compute costs in 2024 were $5 billion, at a discounted Azure rate, which, on an annualized basis, would be around $416 million in revenue a month for Microsoft. It isn't, however, clear whether Microsoft counts OpenAI's compute spend as revenue. Microsoft's earnings do not include an "artificial intelligence" section, but three separate segments: As a result, it's hard to say specifically where OpenAI's revenue sits, but based on an analysis of Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment from FY23 Q1 (note, financial years don’t always correspond with the calendar year, so we just finished FY25 Q2 in January) through to its most recent earnings, and found that there was a spike in revenue from FY23 Q1 to FY24 Q1. In FY23 Q1 (which ended on September 30, 2022, a month before ChatGPT's launch), the segment made $20.3 billion. The following year, in FY24 Q1, it made $24.3 billion — a 19.7% year-over-year (or roughly $4 billion) increase. This could represent the massive increase in training and inference costs associated with hosting ChatGPT, peaking at $28.5 billion in revenue in FY24 Q4 — before dropping dramatically to $24.1 billion in FY25 Q1 and raising a little to $25.5 billion in FY25 Q2. OpenAI spent 2023 training its GPT-4o model before transitioning to its massive, expensive "Orion" model which would eventually become GPT 4.5, as well as its video generation model "Sora." According to the Wall Street Journal, training GPT 4.5 involved at least one training run costing "around half a billion dollars in computing costs alone." These are huge sums, but it’s worth noting a couple of things. First, Microsoft licenses OpenAI’s models to third parties, so some of this revenue could be from other companies using GPT on Azure. And there’s also other companies running their own models on Azure. We’ve seen a lot of companies launch AI products, and not all of them are based on LLMs. Muddling things further, Microsoft provides OpenAI access to Azure cloud services at a discounted rate. And so, there’s a giant question mark over OpenAI’s contribution to the various spikes in revenue for Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment, or whether other third-parties played a significant role. Furthermore, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI isn’t entirely in cold, hard cash. Rather, it has provided the company with credits to be redeemed on Azure services. I’m not entirely sure how this would be represented on accounting terms, and if anyone can shed light on this, please get in touch. Would it be noted as revenue, or something else? OpenAI isn’t paying Microsoft, but rather doing the tech equivalent of redeeming some airmiles, or spending a gift card. Additionally, while equity is often treated as income for tax purposes — as is the case when an employee receives RSUs as part of their compensation package — under the existing OpenAI structure, Microsoft isn’t a shareholder but rather the owner of profit-sharing units. This is a distinction worth noting. These profit-sharing units are treated as analogous to equity, at least in terms of OpenAI’s ability to raise capital, but in practice they aren’t the same thing. They don’t represent ownership in the company as directly as, for example, a normal share unit would. They lack the liquidity of a share, and the upside they provide — namely, dividends — is purely theoretical. Another key difference: when a company goes bankrupt and enters liquidation, shareholders can potentially receive a share of the proceeds (after other creditors, employees, etc are paid). While that often doesn’t happen (as in, the liabilities far exceed the assets of the company), it’s at least theoretically possible. Given that profit-sharing units aren’t actually shares, where does that leave Microsoft? This stuff is confusing, and I’m not ashamed to say that complicated accounting questions like these are far beyond my understanding. If anyone can shed some light, drop me an email, or a message on Twitter or BlueSky, or post on the Better Offline subreddit. I have done my best to write this piece in as objective a tone as possible, regardless of my feelings about the generative AI bubble and its associated boosters. OpenAI, as I've written before, is effectively the entire generative AI industry, with its nearest competitor being less than five percent of its 500 million weekly active users. Its future is dependent — and this is not an opinion, but objective fact — on effectively infinite resources. If it required $40 billion to continue operations this year, it is reasonable to believe it will need at least another $40 billion next year, and based on its internal projections, will need at least that every single other year until 2030, when it claims, somehow, it will be profitable "with the completion of the Stargate data center." OpenAI requires more compute resources than anyone has ever needed, and will continue to do so in perpetuity. Building these resources is now dependent on two partners — Core Scientific and Crusoe — that have never built a data center, as Microsoft has materially pulled back on data center development, which have (as well as the aforementioned pullback on 2GW of data centers) "slowed or paused" some of its "early stage" data center projects. This shift is directly linked to Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI, withTD Cowen's recent analyst report saying that data center pullbacks were, and I quote its March 26 2025 data center channel checks letter, "...driven by the decision to not support incremental OpenAI training workloads." In simpler terms, OpenAI needs more compute at a time when its lead backer, which has the most GPUs in the world, has specifically walked away from building it. Even in my most optimistic frame of mind, it isn't realistic to believe that Crusoe or Core Scientific can build the data centers necessary for OpenAI's expansion. Even if SoftBank and OpenAI had the money to invest in Stargate today, dollars do not change the fabric of reality. Data centers take time to build, requiring concrete, wood, steel and other materials to be manufactured and placed, and that's after the permitting required to get these deals done. Even if that succeeds, getting the power necessary is a challenge unto itself, to the point that even Oracle, an established and storied cloud compute company, to quote The Information, "...has less experience than its larger rivals in dealing with utilities to secure power and working with powerful and demanding cloud customers whose plans change frequently." A partner like Crusoe or Core Scientific simply doesn't have the muscle memory or domain expertise that Microsoft has when it comes to building and operating data centers. As a result, it's hard to imagine even in the best case scenario that they're able to match the hunger for compute that OpenAI has. Now, I want to be clear — I believe OpenAI will still continue to use Microsoft's compute, and even expand further into whatever remaining compute Microsoft may have. However, there is now a hard limit on how much of it there's going to be, both literally (in what's physically available) and in what Microsoft itself will actually OpenAI them to use, especially given how unprofitable GPU compute might be. Last week, a truly offensive piece of fan fiction — framed as a "report" — called AI 2027 went viral, garnering press coverage with the Dwarkesh Podcast and gormless, child-like wonder from the New York Times' Kevin Roose. Its predictions vaguely suggest a theoretical company called OpenBrain will invent a self-teaching agent of some sort. It's bullshit, but it captured the hearts and minds of AI boosters because it vaguely suggests that somehow Large Language Models and their associated technology will become something entirely different. I don't like making predictions like these because the future — especially in our current political climate — is so chaotic, but I will say that I do not see, and I say this with complete objectivity, how any of this continues. I want to be extremely blunt with the following points, as I feel like both members of the media and tech analysts have failed to express how ridiculous things have become. I will be repeating myself, but it's necessary, as I need you to understand how untenable things are. I see no way in which OpenAI can continue to raise money at this rate, even if OpenAI somehow actually receives the $40 billion, which will require it becoming a for-profit entity. While it could theoretically stretch that $40 billion to last multiple years, projections say it’ll burn $320 billion in the next five years. Or, more likely, I can’t see a realistic way in which OpenAI gets the resources it needs to survive. It’ll need a streak of unlikely good fortune, the kind of which you only ever hear about in Greek epic poems: If those things happen, I’ll obviously find myself eating crow. But I’m not worried. In the present conditions, OpenAI is on course to run out of money or compute capacity, and it's unclear which will happen first. Even in a hysterical bubble where everybody is agreeing that this is the future, OpenAI currently requires more money and more compute than is reasonable to acquire. Nobody has ever raised as much as OpenAI needs to, and based on the sheer amount of difficulty that SoftBank is having in raising the funds to meet the lower tranche ($10bn) of its commitment, it may simply not be possible for this company to continue. Even with extremely preferential payment terms — months-long deferred payments, for example — at some point somebody is going to need to get paid. I will give Sam Altman credit. He's found many partners to shoulder the burden of the rotten economics of OpenAI, with Microsoft, Oracle, Crusoe and CoreWeave handling the up-front costs of building the infrastructure, SoftBank finding the investors for its monstrous round, and the tech media mostly handling his marketing for him. He is, however, over-leveraged. OpenAI has never been forced to stand on its own two feet or focus on efficiency, and I believe the constant enabling of its ugly, nonsensical burnrate has doomed this company. OpenAI has acted like it’ll always have more money and compute, and that people will always believe its bullshit, mostly because up until recently everybody has. OpenAI cannot "make things cheaper" at this point, because the money has always been there to make things more expensive, as has the compute to make larger language models that burn billions of dollars a year. This company is not built to reduce its footprint in any way, nor is it built for a future in which it wouldn't have access to, as I've said before, infinite resources. Worse still, investors and the media have run cover for the fact that these models don't really do much more than they did a year ago and for the overall diminishing returns of Large Language Models. I have had many people attack my work about OpenAI, but none have provided any real counterpoint to the underlying economic argument I've made since July of last year that OpenAI is unsustainable. This is likely because there really isn't one, other than "OpenAI will continue to raise more money than anybody has ever raised in history, in perpetuity, and will somehow turn from the least-profitable company of all time to a profitable one." This isn’t a rational argument. It’s a religious one. It’s a call for faith. And I see no greater pale horse of the apocalypse than Microsoft's material pullback on data centers. While the argument might be that Microsoft wants OpenAI to have an independent future, that's laughable when you consider Microsoft's deeply monopolistic tendencies — and, for that matter, it owns a massive proportion of OpenAI’s pseudo-equity. At one point, Microsoft’s portion was valued at 49 percent. And while additional fundraising has likely diluted Microsoft’s stake, it still “owns” a massive proportion of what is (at least) the most valuable private startup of all time. And we’re supposed to believe that Microsoft’s pullback — which limits OpenAI’s access to the infrastructure it needs to train and run its models, and thus (as mentioned) represents an existential threat to the company — is because of some paternal desire to see OpenAI leave the childhood bedroom, spread its wings, and enter the real world? Behave. More likely, Microsoft got what it needed out of OpenAI, which has reached the limit of the models it can develop, and which Microsoft already retains the IP of. There’s probably no reason to make any further significant investments, though they allegedly may be part of the initial $10 billion tranche of OpenAI’s next round. It's also important to note that absolutely nobody other than NVIDIA is making any money from generative AI. CoreWeave loses billions of dollars, OpenAI loses billions of dollars, Anthropic loses billions of dollars, and I can't find a single company providing generative AI-powered software that's making a profit. The only companies even close to doing so are consultancies providing services to train and create data for models like Turing and Scale AI — and Scale isn't even profitable. The knock-on effects of OpenAI's collapse will be wide-ranging. Neither CoreWeave nor Crusoe will have tenants for their massive, unsustainable operations, and Oracle will have nobody to sell the compute it’s leased from Crusoe for the next 15 years. CoreWeave will likely collapse under the weight of its abominable debt, which will lead to a 7%+ revenue drop for NVIDIA at a time when revenue growth has already begun to slow. On a philosophical level, OpenAI's health is what keeps this industry alive. OpenAI has the only meaningful userbase in generative AI, and this entire hype-cycle has been driven by its success, meaning any deterioration (or collapse) of OpenAI will tell the market what I've been saying for over a year: that generative AI is not the next hyper-growth market, and its underlying economics do not make sense. I am not writing this to be "right" or "be a hater." If something changes, and I am wrong somehow, I will write exactly how, and why, and what mistakes I made to come to the conclusions I have in this piece. I do not believe that my peers in the media will do the same when this collapses, but I promise you that they will be held accountable, because all of this abominable waste could have been avoided. Large Language Models are not, on their own, the problem. They're tools, capable of some outcomes, doing some things, but the problem, ultimately, are the extrapolations made about their abilities, and the unnecessary drive to make them larger, even if said largeness never amounted to much. Everything that I'm describing is the result of a tech industry — including media and analysts — that refuses to do business with reality, trafficking in ideas and ideology, celebrating victories that have yet to take place, applauding those who have yet to create the things they're talking about, cheering on men lying about what's possible so that they can continue to burn billions of dollars and increase their wealth and influence. I understand why others might not have written this piece. What I am describing is a systemic failure, one at a scale hereto unseen, one that has involved so many rich and powerful and influential people agreeing to ignore reality, and that’ll have crushing impacts for the wider tech ecosystem when it happens.

Before we go any further: I hate to ask you to do this, but I need your help — I'm up for this year's Webbys for the best business podcast award. I know it's a pain in the ass, but can you sign up and vote for Better Offline? I have never won an award in my life, so help me win this one. Soundtrack: Mastodon - High Road I wanted to start this newsletter with a pithy anecdote about chaos, both that caused by Donald Trump's tariffs and the brittle state of the generative AI bubble. Instead, I am going to write down some questions, and make an attempt to answer them. Last week, OpenAI closed "the largest private tech funding round in history," where it "raised" an astonishing "$40 billion," and the reason that I've put quotation marks around it is that OpenAI has only raised $10 billion of the $40 billion, with the rest arriving by "the end of the year." The remaining $30 billion — $20 billion of which will (allegedly) be provided by SoftBank — is partially contingent on OpenAI's conversion from a non-profit to a for-profit by the end of 2025, and if it fails, SoftBank will only give OpenAI a further $20 billion. The round also valued OpenAI at $300 billion. To put that in context, OpenAI had revenues of $4bn in 2024. This deal values OpenAI at 75 times its revenue. That’s a bigger gulf than Tesla at its peak market cap — a company that was, in fact, worth more than all other legacy car manufacturers combined, despite making far less than them, and shipping a fraction of their vehicles. I also want to add that, as of writing this sentence, this money is yet to arrive. SoftBank's filings say that the money will arrive mid-April — and that SoftBank would be borrowing as much as $10 billion to finance the round, with the option to syndicate part of it to other investors. For the sake of argument, I'm going to assume this money actually arrives. Filings also suggest that "in certain circumstances" the second ($30 billion) tranche could arrive "in early 2026." This isn't great. It also seems that SoftBank's $10 billion commitment is contingent on getting a loan, "...financed through borrowings from Mizuho Bank, Ltd., among other financial institutions." OpenAI also revealed it now has 20 million paying subscribers and over 500 million weekly active users. If you're wondering why it doesn’t talk about monthly active users, it's because they'd likely be much higher than 500 million, which would reveal exactly how poorly OpenAI converts free ChatGPT users to paying ones, and how few people use ChatGPT in their day-to-day lives. The Information reported back in January that OpenAI was generating $25 million in revenue a month from its $200-a-month "Pro" subscribers (it still loses money on every one of them), suggesting around 125,000 ChatGPT Pro subscribers. Assuming the other 19,875,000 users are paying $20 a month, that puts its revenue at about $423 million a month, or about $5 billion a year, from ChatGPT subscriptions. This is what reporters mean when they say "annualized revenue" by the way — it's literally the monthly revenue multiplied by 12. Bloomberg reported recently that OpenAI expects its 2025 revenue to "triple" to $12.7 billion this year. Assuming a similar split of revenue to 2024, this would require OpenAI to nearly double its annualized subscription revenue from Q1 2025 (from $5 billion to around $9.27 billion) and nearly quadruple API revenue (from 2024's revenue of $1 billion, which includes Microsoft's 20% payment for access to OpenAI's models, to $3.43 billion). While these are messy numbers, it's unclear how OpenAI intends to pull this off. The Information reported in February that it planned to do so by making $3 billion a year selling "agents," with ChatGPT subscriptions ($7.9 billion) and API calls ($1.8 billion) making up the rest. This, of course, is utter bollocks. OpenAI's "agents" can't do even the simplest tasks, and three billion dollars of the $12.7 billion figure appears to be a commitment made by SoftBank to purchase OpenAI's tech for its various subsidiaries and business units. Let's say out the numbers precisely: We can assume, in this case, that OpenAI likely has, in the best case scenario, access to roughly $16 billion in liquidity at any given time. It's reasonable to believe that OpenAI will raise more debt this year, and I'd estimate it does so to the tune of around $5 billion or $6 billion. Without it, I am not sure what it’s going to do. As a reminder: OpenAI loses money on every single user. When I wrote "How Does OpenAI Survive?" and "OpenAI Is A Bad Business," I used reported information to explain how this company was, at its core, unsustainable. Let's refresh our memories. It seems, from even a cursory glance, that OpenAI's costs are increasing dramatically. The Information reported earlier in the year that OpenAI projects to spend $13 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2025, nearly tripling what it spent in total on compute in 2024 ($5 billion). This suggests that OpenAI's costs are skyrocketing, and that was before the launch of its new image generator which led to multiple complaints from Altman about a lack of available GPUs, leading to OpenAI's CEO saying to expect "stuff to break" and delays in new products. Nevertheless, even if we assume OpenAI factored in the compute increases into its projections, it still expects to pay Microsoft $13 billion for compute this year. This number, however, doesn't include the $12.9 billion five-year-long compute deal signed with CoreWeave, a deal that was a result of Microsoft declining to pick up the option to buy said compute itself. Payments for this deal, according to The Information, start in October 2025, and assuming that it's evenly paid (the terms of these contracts are generally secret, even in the case of public companies), this would still amount to roughly $2.38 billion a year. However, for the sake of argument, let's consider the payments are around $198 million a month, though there are scenarios — such as, say, CoreWeave's buildout partner not being able to build the data centers or CoreWeave not having the money to pay to build them — where OpenAI might pay less. To be clear, and I’ll explain in greater detail later, this wouldn’t be a good thing, either. While it would be off the hook for some of its payments, it would also be without the compute that’s essential for it to continue growing, serving existing customers, and building new AI models. Cash and compute are both essential to OpenAI’s survival. OpenAI has dedicated somewhere in the region of $19 billion to the Stargate data center project, along with another $19 billion provided by SoftBank and an indeterminate amount by other providers. Based on reporting from Bloomberg, OpenAI plans to have 64,000 Blackwell GPUs running "by the end of 2026," or roughly $3.84 billion worth of them. I should also note that Bloomberg said that 16,000 of these chips would be operational by Summer 2025, though it's unclear if that will actually happen. Though it's unclear who actually pays for what parts of Stargate, it's safe to assume that OpenAI will have to, at the very least, put a billion dollars into a project that is meant to be up and running by the end of 2026, if not more. As of now, Stargate has exactly one data center under development in Abilene, Texas, and as above, it's unclear how that's going, though a recent piece from The Information reported that it was currently "empty and incomplete," and that if it stays that way, "OpenAI could walk away from the deal, which would cost Oracle billions of dollars." Though the article takes pains to assure the reader that won't be likely, even an inkling of such a possibility is a bad sign. Business Insider's reporting on the site in Abilene calls it a "$3.4 billion data center development" (as did the press release from site developer Crusoe), though these numbers don't include GPUs, hardware, or the labor necessary to run them. Right now, Crusoe is (according to Business Insider) building "six new data centers, each with a minimum square footage...[which will] join the two it is already constructing for Oracle." Oracle has signed, according to The Information, a 15-year-long lease with Crusoe for its data centers, all of which will be rented to OpenAI. In any case, OpenAI’s exposure could be much, much higher than the $1bn posited at the start of this section (and I’ll explain in greater depth how I reached that figure at the bottom of this section). If OpenAI has to contribute significantly to the costs associated with building Stargate, it could be on the hook for billions. Data Center Dynamics reports that the Abilene site is meant to have 200MW of compute capacity in the first half of 2025, and then as much as 1.2GW by "mid-2026." To give you a sense of total costs for this project, former Microsoft VP of Energy Brian Janous said in January that it costs about $25 million a megawatt (or $25 billion a gigawatt), meaning that the initial capital expenditures for Stargate to spin up its first 200MW data center will be around $5 billion, spiraling to $30 billion for the entire project. Or perhaps even more. The Information has reported that the site, which could be "...potentially one of the world's biggest AI data centers," could cost "$50 billion to $100 billion in the coming years." Assuming we stick with the lower end of the cost estimates, it’s likely that OpenAI is on the hook for over $5 billion for the Abilene site based on the $19 billion it has agreed to contribute to the entire Stargate project, the (often disagreeing) cost projections of the facility), and the contributions of other partners. This expenditure won’t come all at once, and will be spread across several years. Still, assuming even the rosiest numbers, it's hard to see how OpenAI doesn't have to pony up $1 billion in 2025, with similar annual payments going forward until its completion, and that is likely because the development of this site is going to be heavily delayed by both tariffs, labor shortages, and Oracle's (as reported by The Information) trust in "scrappy but unproven startups to develop the project." Based on reporting from The Information last year, OpenAI will spend at least $2.5 billion across salaries, "data" (referring to buying data from other companies), hosting and other cost of sales, and sales and marketing, and then another billion on what infrastructure OpenAI owns. I expect the latter cost to balloon with OpenAI's investment in physical infrastructure for Stargate. Based on previous estimates, OpenAI spends about $2.25 to make $1. At that rate, it's likely that OpenAI's costs in its rosiest revenue projections of $12.7 billion are at least $28 billion — meaning that it’s on course to burn at least $14 billion in 2025. Assuming that OpenAI has all of its liquidity from last year (it doesn't, but for sake of argument, let’s pretend it still has the full $10 billion), as well as the $10 billion from SoftBank, it is still unclear how it meets its obligations. While OpenAI likely has preferential payment structures with all vendors, such as its discounted rates with Microsoft for Azure cloud services, it will still have to pay them, especially in the case of costs related to Stargate, many of which will be up-front costs. In the event that its costs are as severe as reporting suggests, it’s likely the company will find itself needing to raise more capital — whether through equity (or the weird sort-of equity that it issues) or through debt. And yes, while OpenAI has some revenue, it comes at a terrible cost, and anything that isn’t committed to paying for salaries and construction fees will likely be immediately funnelled directly into funding the obscene costs behind inference and training models like GPT 4.5 — a "giant expensive model" to run that the company has nevertheless pushed to every user. Worse still, OpenAI has, while delaying its next model (GPT-5), promised to launch its o3 reasoning model after saying it wouldn't do so, which is strange, because it turns out that o3 is actually way more expensive to run than people thought. Reasoning models are almost always more expensive to operate, as they involve the model “checking” its work, which, in turn, requires more calculations and more computation. Still, o3 is ludicrously expensive even for this category, with the Arc Prize Foundation (a non-profit that makes the ARC-AGI test for benchmarking models) estimating that it will cost $30,000 a task. As of right now, SoftBank has committed to the following: SoftBank's exposure to OpenAI is materially harming the company. To quote the Wall Street Journal: While one might argue that SoftBank has a good amount of cash, the Journal also adds that it’s somewhat hamstrung in its use as a result of CEO Masayoshi Son's reckless gambles: Worse still, it seems, as mentioned before, that SoftBank will be financing the entirety of the first $10 billion — or $7.5 billion, assuming it finds investors to syndicate the first tranche, and they follow through right until the moment Masayoshi Son hits ‘send’ on the wire transfer . As a result, SoftBank will likely have to start selling off parts of its valuable holdings in companies like Alibaba and ARM, or, worse still, parts of its ailing investments from its Vision Fund, resulting in a material loss on its underwater deals. This is an untenable strategy, and I'll explain why. While we do not have much transparency into OpenAI's actual day-to-day finances, we can make the educated guess that its costs are increasing based on the amount of capital it’s raising. If OpenAI’s costs were flat, or only mildly increasing, we’d expect to see raises roughly the same size as previous ones. Its $40bn raise is nearly six times the previous funding round. Admittedly, multiples like that aren’t particularly unusual. If a company raises $300,000 in a pre-seed round, and $3m in a Series A round, that’s a tenfold increase. But we’re not talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions of dollars. We’re talking about billions of dollars. If OpenAI’s funding round with Softbank goes as planned, it’ll raise the equivalent of the entire GDP of Estonia — a fairly wealthy country itself, and one that’s also a member of Nato and the European Union. That alone should give you a sense of the truly insane scale of this. Insane, sure, but undoubtedly necessary. Per The Information, OpenAI expects to spend as much as $28 billion in compute on Microsoft's Azure cloud in 2028. Over a third of OpenAI's revenue, per the same article, will come from SoftBank's (alleged) spend.It's reasonable to believe that OpenAI will, as a result, need to raise in excess of $40 billion in funding a year, though it's reasonable to believe that it will need to raise more along the lines of $50 billion or more a year until it reaches profitability. This is due to both its growing cost of business, as well as its various infrastructure commitments, both in terms of Stargate, as well as with third-party suppliers like CoreWeave and Microsoft. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's statements around costs also suggest that they're increasing. In late February, Altman claimed that OpenAI was "out of GPUs." While this suggests that there’s demand for some products — like its image-generating tech, which enjoyed a viral day in the sun in March — it also means that to meet the demand it needs to spend more. And, at the risk of repeating myself, that demand doesn’t necessarily translate into profitability. As discussed above, SoftBank has to overcome significant challenges to fund both OpenAI and Stargate, and when I say "fund," I mean fund the current state of both projects, assuming no further obligations. The Information reports that OpenAI forecasts that it will spend $28 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2028. The same article also reports that OpenAI "would turn profitable by the end of the decade after the buildout of Stargate," suggesting that OpenAI's operating expenses will grow exponentially year-over-year. These costs, per The Information, are astronomical: SoftBank has had to (and will continue having to) go to remarkable lengths to fund OpenAI's current ($40 billion) round, lengths so significant that it may lead to its credit rating being further downgraded. Even if we assume the best case scenario — OpenAI successfully converts to a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and receives the full $30 billion — it seems unlikely (if not impossible) for it to continue raising the amount of capital they need to continue operations. As I’ve argued in previous newsletters, there are only a few entities that can provide the kinds of funding that OpenAI needs. These include big tech-focused investment firms like Softbank, sovereign wealth funds (like those of Saudi Arabia and the United Emirates), and perhaps the largest tech companies. These entities can meet OpenAI’s needs, but not all the time. It’s not realistic to expect Softbank, or Microsoft, or the Saudis, or Oracle, or whoever, to provide $40bn every year for the foreseeable future. This is especially true for Softbank. Based on its current promise to not borrow more than 25% of its holdings, it is near-impossible that SoftBank will be able to continue funding OpenAI at this rate ($40 billion a year), and $40 billion a year may not actually be enough. Based on its last reported equity value of holdings, SoftBank's investments and other assets are worth around $229 billion, meaning that it can borrow just over $57bn while remaining compliant with these guidelines. In any case, it is unclear how SoftBank can fund OpenAI, but it's far clearer that nobody else is willing to. Before we go any further, it's important to note that OpenAI does not really have its own compute infrastructure. The majority of its compute is provided by Microsoft, though, as mentioned above, OpenAI now has a deal with CoreWeave to take over Microsoft's future options for more capacity. Anyway, in the last 90 days, Sam Altman has complained about a lack of GPUs and pressure on OpenAI's servers multiple times. Forgive me for repeating stuff from above, but this is necessary. These statements, in a bubble, seem either harmless or like OpenAI's growth is skyrocketing — the latter of which might indeed be true, but bodes ill for a company that burns money on every single user. Any mention of rate limits or performance issues suggests that OpenAI is having significant capacity issues, and at this point it's unclear what further capacity it can actually expand to outside of that currently available. Remember, Microsoft has now pulled out of as much as 2GW of data center projects, walked away from a $1 billion data center development in Ohio, and declined the option on $12bn of compute from CoreWeave that OpenAI had to pick up — meaning that it may be pushing up against the limits of what is physically available. While the total available capacity of GPUs at many providers like Lambda and Crusoe is unknown, we know that CoreWeave has approximately 360MWavailable, compared to Microsoft's 6.5 to 7.5 Gigawatts, a large chunk of which already powers OpenAI. If OpenAI is running into capacity issues, it could be one of the following: Per The Information's reporting, Microsoft "promised OpenAI 300,000 NVIDIA GB200 (Blackwell) chips by the end of 2025," or roughly $18 billion of chips. It's unclear if this has changed since Microsoft allowed OpenAI to seek other compute in late January 2025. I also don't believe that OpenAI has any other viable options for existing compute infrastructure outside of Microsoft. CoreWeave's current data centers mostly feature NVIDIA's aging "Hopper" GPUs, and while it could — and likely is! — retrofitting its current infrastructure with Blackwell chips, doing so is not easy. Blackwell chips require far more powerful cooling and server infrastructure to make them run smoothly (a problem which led to a delay in their delivery to most customers), and even if CoreWeave was able to replace every last Hopper GPU with Blackwell (it won't), it still wouldn't match what OpenAI needs to expand. One might argue that it simply needs to wait for the construction of the Stargate data center, or for CoreWeave to finish the gigawatt or so of construction it’s working on. As I've previously written, I have serious concerns over the viability of CoreWeave ever completing its (alleged) contracted 1.3 Gigawatts of capacity. Per my article: However, even if I were to humour the idea, it is impossible that any of this project is done by the end of the year, or even in 2026. I can find no commitments to any timescale, other than the fact that OpenAI will allegedly start paying CoreWeave in October (per The Information), which could very well be using current capacity. I can also find no evidence that Crusoe, the company building the Stargate data center, has any compute available. Lambda, a GPU compute company that raised $320 million earlier in this year, and according to Data Center Dynamics "operates out of colocation data centers in San Francisco, California, and Allen, Texas, and is backed by more than $820 million in funds raised just this year," suggesting that it may not have their own data centers at all. Its ability to scale is entirely contingent on the availability of whatever data center providers it has relationships with. In any case, this means that OpenAI's only real choice for GPUs is CoreWeave or Microsoft. While it's hard to calculate precisely, OpenAI's best case scenario is that 16,000 GPUs come online in the summer of 2025 as part of the Stargate data center project. That's a drop in the bucket compared to the 300,000 Blackwell GPUs that Microsoft had previously promised. OpenAI is, regardless of how you or I may feel about generative AI, one of the fastest-growing companies of all time. It currently has, according to its own statements, 500 million weekly active users. Putting aside that each user is unprofitable, such remarkable growth — especially as it's partially a result of its extremely resource-intensive image generator — is also a strain on its infrastructure. The vast majority of OpenAI's users are free customers using ChatGPT, with only around 20 million paying subscribers, and the vast majority on the cheapest $20 plan. OpenAI's services — even in the case of image generation — are relatively commoditized, meaning that users can, if they really care, go and use any number of other different Large Language Model services. They can switch to Bing Image Creator, or Grok, or Stable Diffusion, or whatever. Free users are also a burden on the company — especially with such a piss-poor conversion rate — losing it money with each prompt (which is also the case with paying customers), and the remarkable popularity of its image generation service only threatens to bring more burdensome one-off customers that will generate a few abominable Studio Ghibli pictures and then never return. If OpenAI's growth continues at this rate, it will run into capacity issues, and it does not have much room to expand. While we do not know how much capacity it’s taking up with Microsoft, or indeed whether Microsoft is approaching capacity or otherwise limiting how much of it OpenAI can take, we do know that OpenAI has seen reason to beg for access to more GPUs. In simpler terms, even if OpenAI wasn’t running out of money, even if OpenAI wasn’t horrifyingly unprofitable, it also may not have enough GPUs to continue providing its services in a reliable manner. If that's the case, there really isn't much that can be done to fix it other than: The problem is that these measures, even if they succeed in generating more money for the company, also need to reduce the burden on OpenAI's available infrastructure. Remember: data centers can take three to six years to build, and even with the Stargate's accelerated (and I'd argue unrealistic) timelines, OpenAI isn't even unlocking a tenth of Microsoft's promised compute (16,000 GPUs online this year versus the 300,000 GPUs promised by Microsoft). Though downtime might be an obvious choice, capacity issues at OpenAI will likely manifest in hard limits on what free users can do, some of which I've documented above. Nevertheless, I believe the real pale horses of capacity issues come from arbitrary limits on any given user group, meaning both free and paid users. Sudden limits on what a user can do — a reduction in the number of generations of images of videos for paid users, any introduction of "peak hours," or any increases in prices are a sign that OpenAI is running out of GPUs, which it has already publicly said is happening. However, the really obvious one would be service degradation — delays in generations of any kind, 500 status code errors, or ChatGPT failing to fully produce an answer. OpenAI has, up until this point, had fairly impressive uptime. Still, if it is running up against a wall, this streak will end. The consequences depend on how often these issues occur, and to whom they occur. If free users face service degradation, they will bounce off the product, as their use is likely far more fleeting than a paid user, which will begin to erode OpenAI's growth. Ironically, rapid (and especially unprecedented) growth in one of OpenAI’s competitors, like xAI or Anthropic, could also represent a pale horse for OpenAI. If paid users face service degradation, it's likely this will cause the most harm to the company, as while paid users still lose OpenAI money in the end, it at least receives some money in exchange. OpenAI has effectively one choice here: getting more GPUs from Microsoft, and its future depends heavily both on its generosity and there being enough of them at a time when Microsoft has pulled back from two gigawatts of data centers specifically because of it moving away from providing compute for OpenAI. Admittedly, OpenAI has previously spent more on training models than inference (actually running them) and the company might be able to smooth downtime issues by shifting capacity. This would, of course, have a knock-on effect on its ability to continue developing new models, and the company is already losing ground, particularly when it comes to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. As part of its deal with SoftBank, OpenAI must convert its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit entity by December 2025, or it’ll lose $10 billion from its promised funding. Furthermore, in the event that OpenAI fails to convert to a for-profit by October 2026, investors in its previous $6.6 billion round can claw back their investment, with it converting into a loan with an attached interest rate. Naturally, this represents a nightmare scenario for the company, as it’ll increase both its costs and its outgoings. This is a complex situation that almost warrants its own newsletter, but the long and short of it is that OpenAI would have to effectively dissolve itself, start the process of forming an entirely new entity, and distribute its assets to other nonprofits (or sell/license them to the for-profit company at fair market rates). It would require valuing OpenAI's assets, which in and of itself would be a difficult task, as well as getting past the necessary state regulators, the IRS, state revenue agencies, and the upcoming trial with Elon Musk only adds further problems. I’ve simplified things here, and that’s because (as I said) this stuff is complex. Suffice to say, this isn’t as simple as liquidating a company and starting afresh, or submitting a couple of legal filings. It’s a long, fraught process and one that will be — and has been — subject to legal challenges, both from OpenAI’s business rivals, as well as from civil society organizations in California. Based on discussions with experts in the field and my own research, I simply do not know how OpenAI pulls this off by October 2026, let alone by the end of the year. OpenAI has become a load-bearing company for the tech industry, both as a narrative — as previously discussed, ChatGPT is the only Large Language Model company with any meaningful userbase — and as a financial entity. Its ability to meet its obligations and its future expansion plans are critical to the future health — or, in some cases, survival — of multiple large companies, and that's before the after-effects that will affect its customers as a result of any financial collapse. The parallels to the 2007-2008 financial crisis are startling. Lehman Brothers wasn’t the largest investment bank in the world (although it was certainly big), just like OpenAI isn’t the largest tech company (though, again, it’s certainly large in terms of market cap and expenditure). Lehman Brothers’ collapse sparked a contagion that would later spread throughout the global financial services industry, and consequently, the global economy. I can see OpenAI’s failure having a similar systemic effect. While there is a vast difference between OpenAI’s involvement in people’s lives compared to the millions of subprime loans issued to real people, the stock market’s dependence on the value of the Magnificent 7 stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, NVIDIA and Tesla), and in turn the Magnificent 7’s reliance on the stability of the AI boom narrative still threatens material harm to millions of people, and that’s before the ensuing layoffs. And as I’ve said before, this entire narrative is based off of OpenAI’s success, because OpenAI is the generative AI industry. I want to lay out the direct result of any kind of financial crisis at OpenAI, because I don't think anybody is taking this seriously. Per The Information, Oracle, which has taken responsibility for organizing the construction of the Stargate data centers with unproven data center builder Crusoe, "...may need to raise more capital to fund its data center ambitions." Oracle has signed a 15-year lease with Crusoe, and, to quote The Information, "...is on the hook for $1 billion in payments to that firm." To further quote The Information: In simpler terms, Oracle is building a giant data center for one customer — OpenAI — and has taken on the financial burden associated with it. If OpenAI fails to expand, or lacks the capital to actually pay for its share of the Stargate project, Oracle is on the hook for at least a billion dollars, and, based on The Information's reporting, is also on the hook to buy the GPUs for the site. In reality, this development will likely cost tens of billions of dollars, $19 billion of which is due from OpenAI, which does not have the money until it receives its second tranche of funding in December 2025, which is contingent partially on its ability to convert into a for-profit entity, which, as mentioned, is a difficult and unlikely proposition. It's unclear how many of the Blackwell GPUs that Oracle has had to purchase in advance, but in the event of any kind of financial collapse at OpenAI, Oracle would likely take a loss of at least a billion dollars, if not several billion dollars. I have written a lot about publicly-traded AI compute firm CoreWeave, and it would be my greatest pleasure to never mention it again. Nevertheless, I have to. The Financial Times revealed a few weeks ago that CoreWeave's debt payments could balloon to over $2.4 billion a year by the end of 2025, far outstripping its cash reserves, and The Information reported that its cash burn would increase to $15 billion in 2025. As per its IPO filings, 62% of CoreWeave's 2024 revenue (a little under $2 billion, with losses of $863 million) was Microsoft compute, and based on conversations with sources, a good amount of this was Microsoft running compute for OpenAI. Starting October 2025, OpenAI will start paying Coreweave as part of its five-year-long $12 billion contract, picking up the option that Microsoft declined. This is also when CoreWeave will have to start making payments on its massive, multi-billion dollar DDTL 2.0 loan, which likely makes these payments critical to CoreWeave's future. This deal also suggests that OpenAI will become CoreWeave's largest customer. Microsoft had previously committed to spending $10 billion on CoreWeave's services "by the end of the decade," but CEO Satya Nadella added a few months later on a podcast that its relationship with CoreWeave was a "one-time thing." Assuming Microsoft keeps spending at its previous rate — something that isn't guaranteed — it would still be only half of OpenAI's potential revenue. CoreWeave's expansion, at this point, is entirely driven by OpenAI. 77% of its 2024 revenue came from two customers — Microsoft being the largest, and using CoreWeave as an auxiliary supplier of compute for OpenAI. As a result, the future expansion efforts — the theoretical 1.3 gigawatts of contracted (translation: does not exist yet) compute — are largely (if not entirely) for the benefit of OpenAI. In the event that OpenAI cannot fulfil its obligations, CoreWeave will collapse. It is that simple. I’m basing this on a comment I received from Gil Luria, Managing Director and Head of Technology Research at analyst D.A. Davidson & Co: CoreWeave receives preferential access to NVIDIA's GPUs, and makes up billions of dollars of its revenue. CoreWeave then takes those GPUs and raises debt using them as collateral, then proceeds to buy more of those GPUs from NVIDIA. NVIDIA was the anchor for CoreWeave's IPO, and CEO Michael Intrator said that the IPO "wouldn't have closed" without NVIDIA buying $250 million worth of shares. NVIDIA invested $100 million in the early days of CoreWeave, and, for reasons I cannot understand, also agreed to spend $1.3 billion over four years to, and I quote The Information, "rent its own chips from CoreWeave." Buried in CoreWeave's S-1 — the document every company publishes before going public — was a warning about counterparty credit risk, which is when one party provides services or goods to another with specific repayment terms, and the other party not meeting their side of the deal. While this was written as a theoretical (as it could, in theoretically, come from any company to which CoreWeave acts as a creditor) it only named one company: OpenAI. As discussed previously, CoreWeave is saying that, should a customer — any customer, but really, it means OpenAI — fail to pay its bills for infrastructure built on their behalf, or for services rendered, it could have a material risk to the business. CoreWeave's continued ability to do business hinges heavily on its ability to raise further debt (which I have previously called into question), and its ability to raise further debt is, to quote the Financial Times, "secured against its more than 250,000 Nvidia chips and its contracts with customers, such as Microsoft." Any future debt that CoreWeave raises would be based upon its contract with OpenAI (you know, the counterparty credit risk threat that represents a disproportionate share of its revenue) and whatever GPUs it still has to collateralize. As a result, a chunk of NVIDIA's future revenue is dependent on OpenAI's ability to fulfil its obligations to CoreWeave, both in its ability to pay them and their timeliness in doing so. If OpenAI fails, then CoreWeave fails, which then hurts NVIDIA. Contagion. With Microsoft's data center pullback and OpenAI's intent to become independent from Redmond, future data center expansion is based on two partners supporting CoreWeave and Oracle: Crusoe and Core Scientific, neither of which appear to have ever built an AI data center. I also must explain how difficult building a data center is, and how said difficulty increases when you're building an AI-focused data center. For example, NVIDIA had to delay the launch of its Blackwell GPUs because of how finicky the associated infrastructure (the accompanying servers and cooling them) is. For customers that already had experience handling GPUs, and therefore likely know how to manage the extreme temperatures created by them. As another reminder, OpenAI is on the hook for $19 billion of funding behind Stargate, money that neither it nor SoftBank has right now. Imagine if you didn't have any experience, and effectively had to learn from scratch? How do you think that would go? We're about to find out! Crusoe is a former cryptocurrency mining company that has now raised hundreds of millions of dollars to build data centers for AI companies, starting with a $3.4 billion data center financing deal with asset manager Blue Owl Capital. This (yet-to-be-completed) data center has now been leased by Oracle, which will, allegedly, fill it full of GPUs for OpenAI. Despite calling itself "the industry’s first vertically integrated AI infrastructure provider," with the company using flared gas (a waste byproduct of oil production) to power IT infrastructure, Crusoe does not appear to have built an AI data center, and is now being tasked with building a 1.2 Gigawatt data center campus for OpenAI. Crusoe is the sole developer and operator of the Abilene site, meaning, according to The Information, "...is in charge of contracting with construction contractors and data center customers, as well as running the data center after it is built." Oracle, it seems, will be responsible for filling said data center with GPUs and the associated hardware. Nevertheless, the project appears to be behind schedule. The Information reported in October 2024 that Abeline was meant to have "...50,000 of NVIDIA's [Blackwell] AI chips...in the first quarter of [2025]," and also suggested that the site was projected to have 100,000 Blackwell chips by the end of 2025. Here in reality, a report from Bloomberg in March 2025 (that I cited previously) said that OpenAI and Oracle were expected to have 16,000 GPUs available by the Summer of 2025, with "...OpenAI and oracle are expected to deploy 64,000 NVIDIA GB200s at the Stargate data center...by the end of 2026." As discussed above, OpenAI needs this capacity. According to The Information, OpenAI expects Stargate to handle three-quarters of its compute by 2030, and these delays call into question at the very least whether this schedule is reasonable, if not whether Stargate, as a project, is actually possible. I've written a great deal about CoreWeave in the past, and specifically about its buildout partner Core Scientific, a cryptocurrency mining company (yes, another one) that has exactly one customer for AI data centers — CoreWeave. A few notes: Core Scientific is also, it seems, taking on $1.14 billion of capital expenditures to build out these data centers, with CoreWeave promising to reimburse $899.3 million of these costs. It's also unclear how Core Scientific intends to do this. While it’s taken on a good amount of debt in the past — $550 million in a convertible note toward the end of 2024 — this would be more debt than it’s ever taken on. It also, as with Crusoe, does not appear to have any experience building AI data centers, except unlike Crusoe, Core Scientific is a barely-functioning recently-bankrupted bitcoin miner pretending to be a data center company. How important is CoreWeave to OpenAI exactly? From Semafor: But will it survive long term? Going back to the point of contagion: If OpenAI fails, and CoreWeave fails, so too does Core Scientific. And I don’t fancy Crusoe’s chances, either. At least Crusoe isn’t public. Up until fairly recently, Microsoft has been the entire infrastructural backbone of OpenAI, but recently (to free OpenAI up to work with Oracle) released it from its exclusive cloud compute deal. Nevertheless, per The Information, OpenAI still intends to spend $13 billion on compute on Microsoft Azure this year. What's confusing, however, is whether any of this is booked as revenue. Microsoft claimed earlier in this year that it surpassed $13 billion in annual recurring revenue — by which it means its last month multiplied by 12 — from artificial intelligence. OpenAI's compute costs in 2024 were $5 billion, at a discounted Azure rate, which, on an annualized basis, would be around $416 million in revenue a month for Microsoft. It isn't, however, clear whether Microsoft counts OpenAI's compute spend as revenue. Microsoft's earnings do not include an "artificial intelligence" section, but three separate segments: As a result, it's hard to say specifically where OpenAI's revenue sits, but based on an analysis of Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment from FY23 Q1 (note, financial years don’t always correspond with the calendar year, so we just finished FY25 Q2 in January) through to its most recent earnings, and found that there was a spike in revenue from FY23 Q1 to FY24 Q1. In FY23 Q1 (which ended on September 30, 2022, a month before ChatGPT's launch), the segment made $20.3 billion. The following year, in FY24 Q1, it made $24.3 billion — a 19.7% year-over-year (or roughly $4 billion) increase. This could represent the massive increase in training and inference costs associated with hosting ChatGPT, peaking at $28.5 billion in revenue in FY24 Q4 — before dropping dramatically to $24.1 billion in FY25 Q1 and raising a little to $25.5 billion in FY25 Q2. OpenAI spent 2023 training its GPT-4o model before transitioning to its massive, expensive "Orion" model which would eventually become GPT 4.5, as well as its video generation model "Sora." According to the Wall Street Journal, training GPT 4.5 involved at least one training run costing "around half a billion dollars in computing costs alone." These are huge sums, but it’s worth noting a couple of things. First, Microsoft licenses OpenAI’s models to third parties, so some of this revenue could be from other companies using GPT on Azure. And there’s also other companies running their own models on Azure. We’ve seen a lot of companies launch AI products, and not all of them are based on LLMs. Muddling things further, Microsoft provides OpenAI access to Azure cloud services at a discounted rate. And so, there’s a giant question mark over OpenAI’s contribution to the various spikes in revenue for Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment, or whether other third-parties played a significant role. Furthermore, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI isn’t entirely in cold, hard cash. Rather, it has provided the company with credits to be redeemed on Azure services. I’m not entirely sure how this would be represented on accounting terms, and if anyone can shed light on this, please get in touch. Would it be noted as revenue, or something else? OpenAI isn’t paying Microsoft, but rather doing the tech equivalent of redeeming some airmiles, or spending a gift card. Additionally, while equity is often treated as income for tax purposes — as is the case when an employee receives RSUs as part of their compensation package — under the existing OpenAI structure, Microsoft isn’t a shareholder but rather the owner of profit-sharing units. This is a distinction worth noting. These profit-sharing units are treated as analogous to equity, at least in terms of OpenAI’s ability to raise capital, but in practice they aren’t the same thing. They don’t represent ownership in the company as directly as, for example, a normal share unit would. They lack the liquidity of a share, and the upside they provide — namely, dividends — is purely theoretical. Another key difference: when a company goes bankrupt and enters liquidation, shareholders can potentially receive a share of the proceeds (after other creditors, employees, etc are paid). While that often doesn’t happen (as in, the liabilities far exceed the assets of the company), it’s at least theoretically possible. Given that profit-sharing units aren’t actually shares, where does that leave Microsoft? This stuff is confusing, and I’m not ashamed to say that complicated accounting questions like these are far beyond my understanding. If anyone can shed some light, drop me an email, or a message on Twitter or BlueSky, or post on the Better Offline subreddit. I have done my best to write this piece in as objective a tone as possible, regardless of my feelings about the generative AI bubble and its associated boosters. OpenAI, as I've written before, is effectively the entire generative AI industry, with its nearest competitor being less than five percent of its 500 million weekly active users. Its future is dependent — and this is not an opinion, but objective fact — on effectively infinite resources. If it required $40 billion to continue operations this year, it is reasonable to believe it will need at least another $40 billion next year, and based on its internal projections, will need at least that every single other year until 2030, when it claims, somehow, it will be profitable "with the completion of the Stargate data center." OpenAI requires more compute resources than anyone has ever needed, and will continue to do so in perpetuity. Building these resources is now dependent on two partners — Core Scientific and Crusoe — that have never built a data center, as Microsoft has materially pulled back on data center development, which have (as well as the aforementioned pullback on 2GW of data centers) "slowed or paused" some of its "early stage" data center projects. This shift is directly linked to Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI, withTD Cowen's recent analyst report saying that data center pullbacks were, and I quote its March 26 2025 data center channel checks letter, "...driven by the decision to not support incremental OpenAI training workloads." In simpler terms, OpenAI needs more compute at a time when its lead backer, which has the most GPUs in the world, has specifically walked away from building it. Even in my most optimistic frame of mind, it isn't realistic to believe that Crusoe or Core Scientific can build the data centers necessary for OpenAI's expansion. Even if SoftBank and OpenAI had the money to invest in Stargate today, dollars do not change the fabric of reality. Data centers take time to build, requiring concrete, wood, steel and other materials to be manufactured and placed, and that's after the permitting required to get these deals done. Even if that succeeds, getting the power necessary is a challenge unto itself, to the point that even Oracle, an established and storied cloud compute company, to quote The Information, "...has less experience than its larger rivals in dealing with utilities to secure power and working with powerful and demanding cloud customers whose plans change frequently." A partner like Crusoe or Core Scientific simply doesn't have the muscle memory or domain expertise that Microsoft has when it comes to building and operating data centers. As a result, it's hard to imagine even in the best case scenario that they're able to match the hunger for compute that OpenAI has. Now, I want to be clear — I believe OpenAI will still continue to use Microsoft's compute, and even expand further into whatever remaining compute Microsoft may have. However, there is now a hard limit on how much of it there's going to be, both literally (in what's physically available) and in what Microsoft itself will actually OpenAI them to use, especially given how unprofitable GPU compute might be. Last week, a truly offensive piece of fan fiction — framed as a "report" — called AI 2027 went viral, garnering press coverage with the Dwarkesh Podcast and gormless, child-like wonder from the New York Times' Kevin Roose. Its predictions vaguely suggest a theoretical company called OpenBrain will invent a self-teaching agent of some sort. It's bullshit, but it captured the hearts and minds of AI boosters because it vaguely suggests that somehow Large Language Models and their associated technology will become something entirely different. I don't like making predictions like these because the future — especially in our current political climate — is so chaotic, but I will say that I do not see, and I say this with complete objectivity, how any of this continues. I want to be extremely blunt with the following points, as I feel like both members of the media and tech analysts have failed to express how ridiculous things have become. I will be repeating myself, but it's necessary, as I need you to understand how untenable things are. I see no way in which OpenAI can continue to raise money at this rate, even if OpenAI somehow actually receives the $40 billion, which will require it becoming a for-profit entity. While it could theoretically stretch that $40 billion to last multiple years, projections say it’ll burn $320 billion in the next five years. Or, more likely, I can’t see a realistic way in which OpenAI gets the resources it needs to survive. It’ll need a streak of unlikely good fortune, the kind of which you only ever hear about in Greek epic poems: If those things happen, I’ll obviously find myself eating crow. But I’m not worried. In the present conditions, OpenAI is on course to run out of money or compute capacity, and it's unclear which will happen first. Even in a hysterical bubble where everybody is agreeing that this is the future, OpenAI currently requires more money and more compute than is reasonable to acquire. Nobody has ever raised as much as OpenAI needs to, and based on the sheer amount of difficulty that SoftBank is having in raising the funds to meet the lower tranche ($10bn) of its commitment, it may simply not be possible for this company to continue. Even with extremely preferential payment terms — months-long deferred payments, for example — at some point somebody is going to need to get paid. I will give Sam Altman credit. He's found many partners to shoulder the burden of the rotten economics of OpenAI, with Microsoft, Oracle, Crusoe and CoreWeave handling the up-front costs of building the infrastructure, SoftBank finding the investors for its monstrous round, and the tech media mostly handling his marketing for him. He is, however, over-leveraged. OpenAI has never been forced to stand on its own two feet or focus on efficiency, and I believe the constant enabling of its ugly, nonsensical burnrate has doomed this company. OpenAI has acted like it’ll always have more money and compute, and that people will always believe its bullshit, mostly because up until recently everybody has. OpenAI cannot "make things cheaper" at this point, because the money has always been there to make things more expensive, as has the compute to make larger language models that burn billions of dollars a year. This company is not built to reduce its footprint in any way, nor is it built for a future in which it wouldn't have access to, as I've said before, infinite resources. Worse still, investors and the media have run cover for the fact that these models don't really do much more than they did a year ago and for the overall diminishing returns of Large Language Models. I have had many people attack my work about OpenAI, but none have provided any real counterpoint to the underlying economic argument I've made since July of last year that OpenAI is unsustainable. This is likely because there really isn't one, other than "OpenAI will continue to raise more money than anybody has ever raised in history, in perpetuity, and will somehow turn from the least-profitable company of all time to a profitable one." This isn’t a rational argument. It’s a religious one. It’s a call for faith. And I see no greater pale horse of the apocalypse than Microsoft's material pullback on data centers. While the argument might be that Microsoft wants OpenAI to have an independent future, that's laughable when you consider Microsoft's deeply monopolistic tendencies — and, for that matter, it owns a massive proportion of OpenAI’s pseudo-equity. At one point, Microsoft’s portion was valued at 49 percent. And while additional fundraising has likely diluted Microsoft’s stake, it still “owns” a massive proportion of what is (at least) the most valuable private startup of all time. And we’re supposed to believe that Microsoft’s pullback — which limits OpenAI’s access to the infrastructure it needs to train and run its models, and thus (as mentioned) represents an existential threat to the company — is because of some paternal desire to see OpenAI leave the childhood bedroom, spread its wings, and enter the real world? Behave. More likely, Microsoft got what it needed out of OpenAI, which has reached the limit of the models it can develop, and which Microsoft already retains the IP of. There’s probably no reason to make any further significant investments, though they allegedly may be part of the initial $10 billion tranche of OpenAI’s next round. It's also important to note that absolutely nobody other than NVIDIA is making any money from generative AI. CoreWeave loses billions of dollars, OpenAI loses billions of dollars, Anthropic loses billions of dollars, and I can't find a single company providing generative AI-powered software that's making a profit. The only companies even close to doing so are consultancies providing services to train and create data for models like Turing and Scale AI — and Scale isn't even profitable. The knock-on effects of OpenAI's collapse will be wide-ranging. Neither CoreWeave nor Crusoe will have tenants for their massive, unsustainable operations, and Oracle will have nobody to sell the compute it’s leased from Crusoe for the next 15 years. CoreWeave will likely collapse under the weight of its abominable debt, which will lead to a 7%+ revenue drop for NVIDIA at a time when revenue growth has already begun to slow. On a philosophical level, OpenAI's health is what keeps this industry alive. OpenAI has the only meaningful userbase in generative AI, and this entire hype-cycle has been driven by its success, meaning any deterioration (or collapse) of OpenAI will tell the market what I've been saying for over a year: that generative AI is not the next hyper-growth market, and its underlying economics do not make sense. I am not writing this to be "right" or "be a hater." If something changes, and I am wrong somehow, I will write exactly how, and why, and what mistakes I made to come to the conclusions I have in this piece. I do not believe that my peers in the media will do the same when this collapses, but I promise you that they will be held accountable, because all of this abominable waste could have been avoided. Large Language Models are not, on their own, the problem. They're tools, capable of some outcomes, doing some things, but the problem, ultimately, are the extrapolations made about their abilities, and the unnecessary drive to make them larger, even if said largeness never amounted to much. Everything that I'm describing is the result of a tech industry — including media and analysts — that refuses to do business with reality, trafficking in ideas and ideology, celebrating victories that have yet to take place, applauding those who have yet to create the things they're talking about, cheering on men lying about what's possible so that they can continue to burn billions of dollars and increase their wealth and influence. I understand why others might not have written this piece. What I am describing is a systemic failure, one at a scale hereto unseen, one that has involved so many rich and powerful and influential people agreeing to ignore reality, and that’ll have crushing impacts for the wider tech ecosystem when it happens.

Before we go any further: I hate to ask you to do this, but I need your help — I'm up for this year's Webbys for the best business podcast award. I know it's a pain in the ass, but can you sign up and vote for Better Offline? I have never won an award in my life, so help me win this one. Soundtrack: Mastodon - High Road I wanted to start this newsletter with a pithy anecdote about chaos, both that caused by Donald Trump's tariffs and the brittle state of the generative AI bubble. Instead, I am going to write down some questions, and make an attempt to answer them. Last week, OpenAI closed "the largest private tech funding round in history," where it "raised" an astonishing "$40 billion," and the reason that I've put quotation marks around it is that OpenAI has only raised $10 billion of the $40 billion, with the rest arriving by "the end of the year." The remaining $30 billion — $20 billion of which will (allegedly) be provided by SoftBank — is partially contingent on OpenAI's conversion from a non-profit to a for-profit by the end of 2025, and if it fails, SoftBank will only give OpenAI a further $20 billion. The round also valued OpenAI at $300 billion. To put that in context, OpenAI had revenues of $4bn in 2024. This deal values OpenAI at 75 times its revenue. That’s a bigger gulf than Tesla at its peak market cap — a company that was, in fact, worth more than all other legacy car manufacturers combined, despite making far less than them, and shipping a fraction of their vehicles. I also want to add that, as of writing this sentence, this money is yet to arrive. SoftBank's filings say that the money will arrive mid-April — and that SoftBank would be borrowing as much as $10 billion to finance the round, with the option to syndicate part of it to other investors. For the sake of argument, I'm going to assume this money actually arrives. Filings also suggest that "in certain circumstances" the second ($30 billion) tranche could arrive "in early 2026." This isn't great. It also seems that SoftBank's $10 billion commitment is contingent on getting a loan, "...financed through borrowings from Mizuho Bank, Ltd., among other financial institutions." OpenAI also revealed it now has 20 million paying subscribers and over 500 million weekly active users. If you're wondering why it doesn’t talk about monthly active users, it's because they'd likely be much higher than 500 million, which would reveal exactly how poorly OpenAI converts free ChatGPT users to paying ones, and how few people use ChatGPT in their day-to-day lives. The Information reported back in January that OpenAI was generating $25 million in revenue a month from its $200-a-month "Pro" subscribers (it still loses money on every one of them), suggesting around 125,000 ChatGPT Pro subscribers. Assuming the other 19,875,000 users are paying $20 a month, that puts its revenue at about $423 million a month, or about $5 billion a year, from ChatGPT subscriptions. This is what reporters mean when they say "annualized revenue" by the way — it's literally the monthly revenue multiplied by 12. Bloomberg reported recently that OpenAI expects its 2025 revenue to "triple" to $12.7 billion this year. Assuming a similar split of revenue to 2024, this would require OpenAI to nearly double its annualized subscription revenue from Q1 2025 (from $5 billion to around $9.27 billion) and nearly quadruple API revenue (from 2024's revenue of $1 billion, which includes Microsoft's 20% payment for access to OpenAI's models, to $3.43 billion). While these are messy numbers, it's unclear how OpenAI intends to pull this off. The Information reported in February that it planned to do so by making $3 billion a year selling "agents," with ChatGPT subscriptions ($7.9 billion) and API calls ($1.8 billion) making up the rest. This, of course, is utter bollocks. OpenAI's "agents" can't do even the simplest tasks, and three billion dollars of the $12.7 billion figure appears to be a commitment made by SoftBank to purchase OpenAI's tech for its various subsidiaries and business units. Let's say out the numbers precisely: We can assume, in this case, that OpenAI likely has, in the best case scenario, access to roughly $16 billion in liquidity at any given time. It's reasonable to believe that OpenAI will raise more debt this year, and I'd estimate it does so to the tune of around $5 billion or $6 billion. Without it, I am not sure what it’s going to do. As a reminder: OpenAI loses money on every single user. When I wrote "How Does OpenAI Survive?" and "OpenAI Is A Bad Business," I used reported information to explain how this company was, at its core, unsustainable. Let's refresh our memories. It seems, from even a cursory glance, that OpenAI's costs are increasing dramatically. The Information reported earlier in the year that OpenAI projects to spend $13 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2025, nearly tripling what it spent in total on compute in 2024 ($5 billion). This suggests that OpenAI's costs are skyrocketing, and that was before the launch of its new image generator which led to multiple complaints from Altman about a lack of available GPUs, leading to OpenAI's CEO saying to expect "stuff to break" and delays in new products. Nevertheless, even if we assume OpenAI factored in the compute increases into its projections, it still expects to pay Microsoft $13 billion for compute this year. This number, however, doesn't include the $12.9 billion five-year-long compute deal signed with CoreWeave, a deal that was a result of Microsoft declining to pick up the option to buy said compute itself. Payments for this deal, according to The Information, start in October 2025, and assuming that it's evenly paid (the terms of these contracts are generally secret, even in the case of public companies), this would still amount to roughly $2.38 billion a year. However, for the sake of argument, let's consider the payments are around $198 million a month, though there are scenarios — such as, say, CoreWeave's buildout partner not being able to build the data centers or CoreWeave not having the money to pay to build them — where OpenAI might pay less. To be clear, and I’ll explain in greater detail later, this wouldn’t be a good thing, either. While it would be off the hook for some of its payments, it would also be without the compute that’s essential for it to continue growing, serving existing customers, and building new AI models. Cash and compute are both essential to OpenAI’s survival. OpenAI has dedicated somewhere in the region of $19 billion to the Stargate data center project, along with another $19 billion provided by SoftBank and an indeterminate amount by other providers. Based on reporting from Bloomberg, OpenAI plans to have 64,000 Blackwell GPUs running "by the end of 2026," or roughly $3.84 billion worth of them. I should also note that Bloomberg said that 16,000 of these chips would be operational by Summer 2025, though it's unclear if that will actually happen. Though it's unclear who actually pays for what parts of Stargate, it's safe to assume that OpenAI will have to, at the very least, put a billion dollars into a project that is meant to be up and running by the end of 2026, if not more. As of now, Stargate has exactly one data center under development in Abilene, Texas, and as above, it's unclear how that's going, though a recent piece from The Information reported that it was currently "empty and incomplete," and that if it stays that way, "OpenAI could walk away from the deal, which would cost Oracle billions of dollars." Though the article takes pains to assure the reader that won't be likely, even an inkling of such a possibility is a bad sign. Business Insider's reporting on the site in Abilene calls it a "$3.4 billion data center development" (as did the press release from site developer Crusoe), though these numbers don't include GPUs, hardware, or the labor necessary to run them. Right now, Crusoe is (according to Business Insider) building "six new data centers, each with a minimum square footage...[which will] join the two it is already constructing for Oracle." Oracle has signed, according to The Information, a 15-year-long lease with Crusoe for its data centers, all of which will be rented to OpenAI. In any case, OpenAI’s exposure could be much, much higher than the $1bn posited at the start of this section (and I’ll explain in greater depth how I reached that figure at the bottom of this section). If OpenAI has to contribute significantly to the costs associated with building Stargate, it could be on the hook for billions. Data Center Dynamics reports that the Abilene site is meant to have 200MW of compute capacity in the first half of 2025, and then as much as 1.2GW by "mid-2026." To give you a sense of total costs for this project, former Microsoft VP of Energy Brian Janous said in January that it costs about $25 million a megawatt (or $25 billion a gigawatt), meaning that the initial capital expenditures for Stargate to spin up its first 200MW data center will be around $5 billion, spiraling to $30 billion for the entire project. Or perhaps even more. The Information has reported that the site, which could be "...potentially one of the world's biggest AI data centers," could cost "$50 billion to $100 billion in the coming years." Assuming we stick with the lower end of the cost estimates, it’s likely that OpenAI is on the hook for over $5 billion for the Abilene site based on the $19 billion it has agreed to contribute to the entire Stargate project, the (often disagreeing) cost projections of the facility), and the contributions of other partners. This expenditure won’t come all at once, and will be spread across several years. Still, assuming even the rosiest numbers, it's hard to see how OpenAI doesn't have to pony up $1 billion in 2025, with similar annual payments going forward until its completion, and that is likely because the development of this site is going to be heavily delayed by both tariffs, labor shortages, and Oracle's (as reported by The Information) trust in "scrappy but unproven startups to develop the project." Based on reporting from The Information last year, OpenAI will spend at least $2.5 billion across salaries, "data" (referring to buying data from other companies), hosting and other cost of sales, and sales and marketing, and then another billion on what infrastructure OpenAI owns. I expect the latter cost to balloon with OpenAI's investment in physical infrastructure for Stargate. Based on previous estimates, OpenAI spends about $2.25 to make $1. At that rate, it's likely that OpenAI's costs in its rosiest revenue projections of $12.7 billion are at least $28 billion — meaning that it’s on course to burn at least $14 billion in 2025. Assuming that OpenAI has all of its liquidity from last year (it doesn't, but for sake of argument, let’s pretend it still has the full $10 billion), as well as the $10 billion from SoftBank, it is still unclear how it meets its obligations. While OpenAI likely has preferential payment structures with all vendors, such as its discounted rates with Microsoft for Azure cloud services, it will still have to pay them, especially in the case of costs related to Stargate, many of which will be up-front costs. In the event that its costs are as severe as reporting suggests, it’s likely the company will find itself needing to raise more capital — whether through equity (or the weird sort-of equity that it issues) or through debt. And yes, while OpenAI has some revenue, it comes at a terrible cost, and anything that isn’t committed to paying for salaries and construction fees will likely be immediately funnelled directly into funding the obscene costs behind inference and training models like GPT 4.5 — a "giant expensive model" to run that the company has nevertheless pushed to every user. Worse still, OpenAI has, while delaying its next model (GPT-5), promised to launch its o3 reasoning model after saying it wouldn't do so, which is strange, because it turns out that o3 is actually way more expensive to run than people thought. Reasoning models are almost always more expensive to operate, as they involve the model “checking” its work, which, in turn, requires more calculations and more computation. Still, o3 is ludicrously expensive even for this category, with the Arc Prize Foundation (a non-profit that makes the ARC-AGI test for benchmarking models) estimating that it will cost $30,000 a task. As of right now, SoftBank has committed to the following: SoftBank's exposure to OpenAI is materially harming the company. To quote the Wall Street Journal: While one might argue that SoftBank has a good amount of cash, the Journal also adds that it’s somewhat hamstrung in its use as a result of CEO Masayoshi Son's reckless gambles: Worse still, it seems, as mentioned before, that SoftBank will be financing the entirety of the first $10 billion — or $7.5 billion, assuming it finds investors to syndicate the first tranche, and they follow through right until the moment Masayoshi Son hits ‘send’ on the wire transfer . As a result, SoftBank will likely have to start selling off parts of its valuable holdings in companies like Alibaba and ARM, or, worse still, parts of its ailing investments from its Vision Fund, resulting in a material loss on its underwater deals. This is an untenable strategy, and I'll explain why. While we do not have much transparency into OpenAI's actual day-to-day finances, we can make the educated guess that its costs are increasing based on the amount of capital it’s raising. If OpenAI’s costs were flat, or only mildly increasing, we’d expect to see raises roughly the same size as previous ones. Its $40bn raise is nearly six times the previous funding round. Admittedly, multiples like that aren’t particularly unusual. If a company raises $300,000 in a pre-seed round, and $3m in a Series A round, that’s a tenfold increase. But we’re not talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions of dollars. We’re talking about billions of dollars. If OpenAI’s funding round with Softbank goes as planned, it’ll raise the equivalent of the entire GDP of Estonia — a fairly wealthy country itself, and one that’s also a member of Nato and the European Union. That alone should give you a sense of the truly insane scale of this. Insane, sure, but undoubtedly necessary. Per The Information, OpenAI expects to spend as much as $28 billion in compute on Microsoft's Azure cloud in 2028. Over a third of OpenAI's revenue, per the same article, will come from SoftBank's (alleged) spend.It's reasonable to believe that OpenAI will, as a result, need to raise in excess of $40 billion in funding a year, though it's reasonable to believe that it will need to raise more along the lines of $50 billion or more a year until it reaches profitability. This is due to both its growing cost of business, as well as its various infrastructure commitments, both in terms of Stargate, as well as with third-party suppliers like CoreWeave and Microsoft. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's statements around costs also suggest that they're increasing. In late February, Altman claimed that OpenAI was "out of GPUs." While this suggests that there’s demand for some products — like its image-generating tech, which enjoyed a viral day in the sun in March — it also means that to meet the demand it needs to spend more. And, at the risk of repeating myself, that demand doesn’t necessarily translate into profitability. As discussed above, SoftBank has to overcome significant challenges to fund both OpenAI and Stargate, and when I say "fund," I mean fund the current state of both projects, assuming no further obligations. The Information reports that OpenAI forecasts that it will spend $28 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2028. The same article also reports that OpenAI "would turn profitable by the end of the decade after the buildout of Stargate," suggesting that OpenAI's operating expenses will grow exponentially year-over-year. These costs, per The Information, are astronomical: SoftBank has had to (and will continue having to) go to remarkable lengths to fund OpenAI's current ($40 billion) round, lengths so significant that it may lead to its credit rating being further downgraded. Even if we assume the best case scenario — OpenAI successfully converts to a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and receives the full $30 billion — it seems unlikely (if not impossible) for it to continue raising the amount of capital they need to continue operations. As I’ve argued in previous newsletters, there are only a few entities that can provide the kinds of funding that OpenAI needs. These include big tech-focused investment firms like Softbank, sovereign wealth funds (like those of Saudi Arabia and the United Emirates), and perhaps the largest tech companies. These entities can meet OpenAI’s needs, but not all the time. It’s not realistic to expect Softbank, or Microsoft, or the Saudis, or Oracle, or whoever, to provide $40bn every year for the foreseeable future. This is especially true for Softbank. Based on its current promise to not borrow more than 25% of its holdings, it is near-impossible that SoftBank will be able to continue funding OpenAI at this rate ($40 billion a year), and $40 billion a year may not actually be enough. Based on its last reported equity value of holdings, SoftBank's investments and other assets are worth around $229 billion, meaning that it can borrow just over $57bn while remaining compliant with these guidelines. In any case, it is unclear how SoftBank can fund OpenAI, but it's far clearer that nobody else is willing to. Before we go any further, it's important to note that OpenAI does not really have its own compute infrastructure. The majority of its compute is provided by Microsoft, though, as mentioned above, OpenAI now has a deal with CoreWeave to take over Microsoft's future options for more capacity. Anyway, in the last 90 days, Sam Altman has complained about a lack of GPUs and pressure on OpenAI's servers multiple times. Forgive me for repeating stuff from above, but this is necessary. These statements, in a bubble, seem either harmless or like OpenAI's growth is skyrocketing — the latter of which might indeed be true, but bodes ill for a company that burns money on every single user. Any mention of rate limits or performance issues suggests that OpenAI is having significant capacity issues, and at this point it's unclear what further capacity it can actually expand to outside of that currently available. Remember, Microsoft has now pulled out of as much as 2GW of data center projects, walked away from a $1 billion data center development in Ohio, and declined the option on $12bn of compute from CoreWeave that OpenAI had to pick up — meaning that it may be pushing up against the limits of what is physically available. While the total available capacity of GPUs at many providers like Lambda and Crusoe is unknown, we know that CoreWeave has approximately 360MWavailable, compared to Microsoft's 6.5 to 7.5 Gigawatts, a large chunk of which already powers OpenAI. If OpenAI is running into capacity issues, it could be one of the following: Per The Information's reporting, Microsoft "promised OpenAI 300,000 NVIDIA GB200 (Blackwell) chips by the end of 2025," or roughly $18 billion of chips. It's unclear if this has changed since Microsoft allowed OpenAI to seek other compute in late January 2025. I also don't believe that OpenAI has any other viable options for existing compute infrastructure outside of Microsoft. CoreWeave's current data centers mostly feature NVIDIA's aging "Hopper" GPUs, and while it could — and likely is! — retrofitting its current infrastructure with Blackwell chips, doing so is not easy. Blackwell chips require far more powerful cooling and server infrastructure to make them run smoothly (a problem which led to a delay in their delivery to most customers), and even if CoreWeave was able to replace every last Hopper GPU with Blackwell (it won't), it still wouldn't match what OpenAI needs to expand. One might argue that it simply needs to wait for the construction of the Stargate data center, or for CoreWeave to finish the gigawatt or so of construction it’s working on. As I've previously written, I have serious concerns over the viability of CoreWeave ever completing its (alleged) contracted 1.3 Gigawatts of capacity. Per my article: However, even if I were to humour the idea, it is impossible that any of this project is done by the end of the year, or even in 2026. I can find no commitments to any timescale, other than the fact that OpenAI will allegedly start paying CoreWeave in October (per The Information), which could very well be using current capacity. I can also find no evidence that Crusoe, the company building the Stargate data center, has any compute available. Lambda, a GPU compute company that raised $320 million earlier in this year, and according to Data Center Dynamics "operates out of colocation data centers in San Francisco, California, and Allen, Texas, and is backed by more than $820 million in funds raised just this year," suggesting that it may not have their own data centers at all. Its ability to scale is entirely contingent on the availability of whatever data center providers it has relationships with. In any case, this means that OpenAI's only real choice for GPUs is CoreWeave or Microsoft. While it's hard to calculate precisely, OpenAI's best case scenario is that 16,000 GPUs come online in the summer of 2025 as part of the Stargate data center project. That's a drop in the bucket compared to the 300,000 Blackwell GPUs that Microsoft had previously promised. OpenAI is, regardless of how you or I may feel about generative AI, one of the fastest-growing companies of all time. It currently has, according to its own statements, 500 million weekly active users. Putting aside that each user is unprofitable, such remarkable growth — especially as it's partially a result of its extremely resource-intensive image generator — is also a strain on its infrastructure. The vast majority of OpenAI's users are free customers using ChatGPT, with only around 20 million paying subscribers, and the vast majority on the cheapest $20 plan. OpenAI's services — even in the case of image generation — are relatively commoditized, meaning that users can, if they really care, go and use any number of other different Large Language Model services. They can switch to Bing Image Creator, or Grok, or Stable Diffusion, or whatever. Free users are also a burden on the company — especially with such a piss-poor conversion rate — losing it money with each prompt (which is also the case with paying customers), and the remarkable popularity of its image generation service only threatens to bring more burdensome one-off customers that will generate a few abominable Studio Ghibli pictures and then never return. If OpenAI's growth continues at this rate, it will run into capacity issues, and it does not have much room to expand. While we do not know how much capacity it’s taking up with Microsoft, or indeed whether Microsoft is approaching capacity or otherwise limiting how much of it OpenAI can take, we do know that OpenAI has seen reason to beg for access to more GPUs. In simpler terms, even if OpenAI wasn’t running out of money, even if OpenAI wasn’t horrifyingly unprofitable, it also may not have enough GPUs to continue providing its services in a reliable manner. If that's the case, there really isn't much that can be done to fix it other than: The problem is that these measures, even if they succeed in generating more money for the company, also need to reduce the burden on OpenAI's available infrastructure. Remember: data centers can take three to six years to build, and even with the Stargate's accelerated (and I'd argue unrealistic) timelines, OpenAI isn't even unlocking a tenth of Microsoft's promised compute (16,000 GPUs online this year versus the 300,000 GPUs promised by Microsoft). Though downtime might be an obvious choice, capacity issues at OpenAI will likely manifest in hard limits on what free users can do, some of which I've documented above. Nevertheless, I believe the real pale horses of capacity issues come from arbitrary limits on any given user group, meaning both free and paid users. Sudden limits on what a user can do — a reduction in the number of generations of images of videos for paid users, any introduction of "peak hours," or any increases in prices are a sign that OpenAI is running out of GPUs, which it has already publicly said is happening. However, the really obvious one would be service degradation — delays in generations of any kind, 500 status code errors, or ChatGPT failing to fully produce an answer. OpenAI has, up until this point, had fairly impressive uptime. Still, if it is running up against a wall, this streak will end. The consequences depend on how often these issues occur, and to whom they occur. If free users face service degradation, they will bounce off the product, as their use is likely far more fleeting than a paid user, which will begin to erode OpenAI's growth. Ironically, rapid (and especially unprecedented) growth in one of OpenAI’s competitors, like xAI or Anthropic, could also represent a pale horse for OpenAI. If paid users face service degradation, it's likely this will cause the most harm to the company, as while paid users still lose OpenAI money in the end, it at least receives some money in exchange. OpenAI has effectively one choice here: getting more GPUs from Microsoft, and its future depends heavily both on its generosity and there being enough of them at a time when Microsoft has pulled back from two gigawatts of data centers specifically because of it moving away from providing compute for OpenAI. Admittedly, OpenAI has previously spent more on training models than inference (actually running them) and the company might be able to smooth downtime issues by shifting capacity. This would, of course, have a knock-on effect on its ability to continue developing new models, and the company is already losing ground, particularly when it comes to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. As part of its deal with SoftBank, OpenAI must convert its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit entity by December 2025, or it’ll lose $10 billion from its promised funding. Furthermore, in the event that OpenAI fails to convert to a for-profit by October 2026, investors in its previous $6.6 billion round can claw back their investment, with it converting into a loan with an attached interest rate. Naturally, this represents a nightmare scenario for the company, as it’ll increase both its costs and its outgoings. This is a complex situation that almost warrants its own newsletter, but the long and short of it is that OpenAI would have to effectively dissolve itself, start the process of forming an entirely new entity, and distribute its assets to other nonprofits (or sell/license them to the for-profit company at fair market rates). It would require valuing OpenAI's assets, which in and of itself would be a difficult task, as well as getting past the necessary state regulators, the IRS, state revenue agencies, and the upcoming trial with Elon Musk only adds further problems. I’ve simplified things here, and that’s because (as I said) this stuff is complex. Suffice to say, this isn’t as simple as liquidating a company and starting afresh, or submitting a couple of legal filings. It’s a long, fraught process and one that will be — and has been — subject to legal challenges, both from OpenAI’s business rivals, as well as from civil society organizations in California. Based on discussions with experts in the field and my own research, I simply do not know how OpenAI pulls this off by October 2026, let alone by the end of the year. OpenAI has become a load-bearing company for the tech industry, both as a narrative — as previously discussed, ChatGPT is the only Large Language Model company with any meaningful userbase — and as a financial entity. Its ability to meet its obligations and its future expansion plans are critical to the future health — or, in some cases, survival — of multiple large companies, and that's before the after-effects that will affect its customers as a result of any financial collapse. The parallels to the 2007-2008 financial crisis are startling. Lehman Brothers wasn’t the largest investment bank in the world (although it was certainly big), just like OpenAI isn’t the largest tech company (though, again, it’s certainly large in terms of market cap and expenditure). Lehman Brothers’ collapse sparked a contagion that would later spread throughout the global financial services industry, and consequently, the global economy. I can see OpenAI’s failure having a similar systemic effect. While there is a vast difference between OpenAI’s involvement in people’s lives compared to the millions of subprime loans issued to real people, the stock market’s dependence on the value of the Magnificent 7 stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, NVIDIA and Tesla), and in turn the Magnificent 7’s reliance on the stability of the AI boom narrative still threatens material harm to millions of people, and that’s before the ensuing layoffs. And as I’ve said before, this entire narrative is based off of OpenAI’s success, because OpenAI is the generative AI industry. I want to lay out the direct result of any kind of financial crisis at OpenAI, because I don't think anybody is taking this seriously. Per The Information, Oracle, which has taken responsibility for organizing the construction of the Stargate data centers with unproven data center builder Crusoe, "...may need to raise more capital to fund its data center ambitions." Oracle has signed a 15-year lease with Crusoe, and, to quote The Information, "...is on the hook for $1 billion in payments to that firm." To further quote The Information: In simpler terms, Oracle is building a giant data center for one customer — OpenAI — and has taken on the financial burden associated with it. If OpenAI fails to expand, or lacks the capital to actually pay for its share of the Stargate project, Oracle is on the hook for at least a billion dollars, and, based on The Information's reporting, is also on the hook to buy the GPUs for the site. In reality, this development will likely cost tens of billions of dollars, $19 billion of which is due from OpenAI, which does not have the money until it receives its second tranche of funding in December 2025, which is contingent partially on its ability to convert into a for-profit entity, which, as mentioned, is a difficult and unlikely proposition. It's unclear how many of the Blackwell GPUs that Oracle has had to purchase in advance, but in the event of any kind of financial collapse at OpenAI, Oracle would likely take a loss of at least a billion dollars, if not several billion dollars. I have written a lot about publicly-traded AI compute firm CoreWeave, and it would be my greatest pleasure to never mention it again. Nevertheless, I have to. The Financial Times revealed a few weeks ago that CoreWeave's debt payments could balloon to over $2.4 billion a year by the end of 2025, far outstripping its cash reserves, and The Information reported that its cash burn would increase to $15 billion in 2025. As per its IPO filings, 62% of CoreWeave's 2024 revenue (a little under $2 billion, with losses of $863 million) was Microsoft compute, and based on conversations with sources, a good amount of this was Microsoft running compute for OpenAI. Starting October 2025, OpenAI will start paying Coreweave as part of its five-year-long $12 billion contract, picking up the option that Microsoft declined. This is also when CoreWeave will have to start making payments on its massive, multi-billion dollar DDTL 2.0 loan, which likely makes these payments critical to CoreWeave's future. This deal also suggests that OpenAI will become CoreWeave's largest customer. Microsoft had previously committed to spending $10 billion on CoreWeave's services "by the end of the decade," but CEO Satya Nadella added a few months later on a podcast that its relationship with CoreWeave was a "one-time thing." Assuming Microsoft keeps spending at its previous rate — something that isn't guaranteed — it would still be only half of OpenAI's potential revenue. CoreWeave's expansion, at this point, is entirely driven by OpenAI. 77% of its 2024 revenue came from two customers — Microsoft being the largest, and using CoreWeave as an auxiliary supplier of compute for OpenAI. As a result, the future expansion efforts — the theoretical 1.3 gigawatts of contracted (translation: does not exist yet) compute — are largely (if not entirely) for the benefit of OpenAI. In the event that OpenAI cannot fulfil its obligations, CoreWeave will collapse. It is that simple. I’m basing this on a comment I received from Gil Luria, Managing Director and Head of Technology Research at analyst D.A. Davidson & Co: CoreWeave receives preferential access to NVIDIA's GPUs, and makes up billions of dollars of its revenue. CoreWeave then takes those GPUs and raises debt using them as collateral, then proceeds to buy more of those GPUs from NVIDIA. NVIDIA was the anchor for CoreWeave's IPO, and CEO Michael Intrator said that the IPO "wouldn't have closed" without NVIDIA buying $250 million worth of shares. NVIDIA invested $100 million in the early days of CoreWeave, and, for reasons I cannot understand, also agreed to spend $1.3 billion over four years to, and I quote The Information, "rent its own chips from CoreWeave." Buried in CoreWeave's S-1 — the document every company publishes before going public — was a warning about counterparty credit risk, which is when one party provides services or goods to another with specific repayment terms, and the other party not meeting their side of the deal. While this was written as a theoretical (as it could, in theoretically, come from any company to which CoreWeave acts as a creditor) it only named one company: OpenAI. As discussed previously, CoreWeave is saying that, should a customer — any customer, but really, it means OpenAI — fail to pay its bills for infrastructure built on their behalf, or for services rendered, it could have a material risk to the business. CoreWeave's continued ability to do business hinges heavily on its ability to raise further debt (which I have previously called into question), and its ability to raise further debt is, to quote the Financial Times, "secured against its more than 250,000 Nvidia chips and its contracts with customers, such as Microsoft." Any future debt that CoreWeave raises would be based upon its contract with OpenAI (you know, the counterparty credit risk threat that represents a disproportionate share of its revenue) and whatever GPUs it still has to collateralize. As a result, a chunk of NVIDIA's future revenue is dependent on OpenAI's ability to fulfil its obligations to CoreWeave, both in its ability to pay them and their timeliness in doing so. If OpenAI fails, then CoreWeave fails, which then hurts NVIDIA. Contagion. With Microsoft's data center pullback and OpenAI's intent to become independent from Redmond, future data center expansion is based on two partners supporting CoreWeave and Oracle: Crusoe and Core Scientific, neither of which appear to have ever built an AI data center. I also must explain how difficult building a data center is, and how said difficulty increases when you're building an AI-focused data center. For example, NVIDIA had to delay the launch of its Blackwell GPUs because of how finicky the associated infrastructure (the accompanying servers and cooling them) is. For customers that already had experience handling GPUs, and therefore likely know how to manage the extreme temperatures created by them. As another reminder, OpenAI is on the hook for $19 billion of funding behind Stargate, money that neither it nor SoftBank has right now. Imagine if you didn't have any experience, and effectively had to learn from scratch? How do you think that would go? We're about to find out! Crusoe is a former cryptocurrency mining company that has now raised hundreds of millions of dollars to build data centers for AI companies, starting with a $3.4 billion data center financing deal with asset manager Blue Owl Capital. This (yet-to-be-completed) data center has now been leased by Oracle, which will, allegedly, fill it full of GPUs for OpenAI. Despite calling itself "the industry’s first vertically integrated AI infrastructure provider," with the company using flared gas (a waste byproduct of oil production) to power IT infrastructure, Crusoe does not appear to have built an AI data center, and is now being tasked with building a 1.2 Gigawatt data center campus for OpenAI. Crusoe is the sole developer and operator of the Abilene site, meaning, according to The Information, "...is in charge of contracting with construction contractors and data center customers, as well as running the data center after it is built." Oracle, it seems, will be responsible for filling said data center with GPUs and the associated hardware. Nevertheless, the project appears to be behind schedule. The Information reported in October 2024 that Abeline was meant to have "...50,000 of NVIDIA's [Blackwell] AI chips...in the first quarter of [2025]," and also suggested that the site was projected to have 100,000 Blackwell chips by the end of 2025. Here in reality, a report from Bloomberg in March 2025 (that I cited previously) said that OpenAI and Oracle were expected to have 16,000 GPUs available by the Summer of 2025, with "...OpenAI and oracle are expected to deploy 64,000 NVIDIA GB200s at the Stargate data center...by the end of 2026." As discussed above, OpenAI needs this capacity. According to The Information, OpenAI expects Stargate to handle three-quarters of its compute by 2030, and these delays call into question at the very least whether this schedule is reasonable, if not whether Stargate, as a project, is actually possible. I've written a great deal about CoreWeave in the past, and specifically about its buildout partner Core Scientific, a cryptocurrency mining company (yes, another one) that has exactly one customer for AI data centers — CoreWeave. A few notes: Core Scientific is also, it seems, taking on $1.14 billion of capital expenditures to build out these data centers, with CoreWeave promising to reimburse $899.3 million of these costs. It's also unclear how Core Scientific intends to do this. While it’s taken on a good amount of debt in the past — $550 million in a convertible note toward the end of 2024 — this would be more debt than it’s ever taken on. It also, as with Crusoe, does not appear to have any experience building AI data centers, except unlike Crusoe, Core Scientific is a barely-functioning recently-bankrupted bitcoin miner pretending to be a data center company. How important is CoreWeave to OpenAI exactly? From Semafor: But will it survive long term? Going back to the point of contagion: If OpenAI fails, and CoreWeave fails, so too does Core Scientific. And I don’t fancy Crusoe’s chances, either. At least Crusoe isn’t public. Up until fairly recently, Microsoft has been the entire infrastructural backbone of OpenAI, but recently (to free OpenAI up to work with Oracle) released it from its exclusive cloud compute deal. Nevertheless, per The Information, OpenAI still intends to spend $13 billion on compute on Microsoft Azure this year. What's confusing, however, is whether any of this is booked as revenue. Microsoft claimed earlier in this year that it surpassed $13 billion in annual recurring revenue — by which it means its last month multiplied by 12 — from artificial intelligence. OpenAI's compute costs in 2024 were $5 billion, at a discounted Azure rate, which, on an annualized basis, would be around $416 million in revenue a month for Microsoft. It isn't, however, clear whether Microsoft counts OpenAI's compute spend as revenue. Microsoft's earnings do not include an "artificial intelligence" section, but three separate segments: As a result, it's hard to say specifically where OpenAI's revenue sits, but based on an analysis of Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment from FY23 Q1 (note, financial years don’t always correspond with the calendar year, so we just finished FY25 Q2 in January) through to its most recent earnings, and found that there was a spike in revenue from FY23 Q1 to FY24 Q1. In FY23 Q1 (which ended on September 30, 2022, a month before ChatGPT's launch), the segment made $20.3 billion. The following year, in FY24 Q1, it made $24.3 billion — a 19.7% year-over-year (or roughly $4 billion) increase. This could represent the massive increase in training and inference costs associated with hosting ChatGPT, peaking at $28.5 billion in revenue in FY24 Q4 — before dropping dramatically to $24.1 billion in FY25 Q1 and raising a little to $25.5 billion in FY25 Q2. OpenAI spent 2023 training its GPT-4o model before transitioning to its massive, expensive "Orion" model which would eventually become GPT 4.5, as well as its video generation model "Sora." According to the Wall Street Journal, training GPT 4.5 involved at least one training run costing "around half a billion dollars in computing costs alone." These are huge sums, but it’s worth noting a couple of things. First, Microsoft licenses OpenAI’s models to third parties, so some of this revenue could be from other companies using GPT on Azure. And there’s also other companies running their own models on Azure. We’ve seen a lot of companies launch AI products, and not all of them are based on LLMs. Muddling things further, Microsoft provides OpenAI access to Azure cloud services at a discounted rate. And so, there’s a giant question mark over OpenAI’s contribution to the various spikes in revenue for Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment, or whether other third-parties played a significant role. Furthermore, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI isn’t entirely in cold, hard cash. Rather, it has provided the company with credits to be redeemed on Azure services. I’m not entirely sure how this would be represented on accounting terms, and if anyone can shed light on this, please get in touch. Would it be noted as revenue, or something else? OpenAI isn’t paying Microsoft, but rather doing the tech equivalent of redeeming some airmiles, or spending a gift card. Additionally, while equity is often treated as income for tax purposes — as is the case when an employee receives RSUs as part of their compensation package — under the existing OpenAI structure, Microsoft isn’t a shareholder but rather the owner of profit-sharing units. This is a distinction worth noting. These profit-sharing units are treated as analogous to equity, at least in terms of OpenAI’s ability to raise capital, but in practice they aren’t the same thing. They don’t represent ownership in the company as directly as, for example, a normal share unit would. They lack the liquidity of a share, and the upside they provide — namely, dividends — is purely theoretical. Another key difference: when a company goes bankrupt and enters liquidation, shareholders can potentially receive a share of the proceeds (after other creditors, employees, etc are paid). While that often doesn’t happen (as in, the liabilities far exceed the assets of the company), it’s at least theoretically possible. Given that profit-sharing units aren’t actually shares, where does that leave Microsoft? This stuff is confusing, and I’m not ashamed to say that complicated accounting questions like these are far beyond my understanding. If anyone can shed some light, drop me an email, or a message on Twitter or BlueSky, or post on the Better Offline subreddit. I have done my best to write this piece in as objective a tone as possible, regardless of my feelings about the generative AI bubble and its associated boosters. OpenAI, as I've written before, is effectively the entire generative AI industry, with its nearest competitor being less than five percent of its 500 million weekly active users. Its future is dependent — and this is not an opinion, but objective fact — on effectively infinite resources. If it required $40 billion to continue operations this year, it is reasonable to believe it will need at least another $40 billion next year, and based on its internal projections, will need at least that every single other year until 2030, when it claims, somehow, it will be profitable "with the completion of the Stargate data center." OpenAI requires more compute resources than anyone has ever needed, and will continue to do so in perpetuity. Building these resources is now dependent on two partners — Core Scientific and Crusoe — that have never built a data center, as Microsoft has materially pulled back on data center development, which have (as well as the aforementioned pullback on 2GW of data centers) "slowed or paused" some of its "early stage" data center projects. This shift is directly linked to Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI, withTD Cowen's recent analyst report saying that data center pullbacks were, and I quote its March 26 2025 data center channel checks letter, "...driven by the decision to not support incremental OpenAI training workloads." In simpler terms, OpenAI needs more compute at a time when its lead backer, which has the most GPUs in the world, has specifically walked away from building it. Even in my most optimistic frame of mind, it isn't realistic to believe that Crusoe or Core Scientific can build the data centers necessary for OpenAI's expansion. Even if SoftBank and OpenAI had the money to invest in Stargate today, dollars do not change the fabric of reality. Data centers take time to build, requiring concrete, wood, steel and other materials to be manufactured and placed, and that's after the permitting required to get these deals done. Even if that succeeds, getting the power necessary is a challenge unto itself, to the point that even Oracle, an established and storied cloud compute company, to quote The Information, "...has less experience than its larger rivals in dealing with utilities to secure power and working with powerful and demanding cloud customers whose plans change frequently." A partner like Crusoe or Core Scientific simply doesn't have the muscle memory or domain expertise that Microsoft has when it comes to building and operating data centers. As a result, it's hard to imagine even in the best case scenario that they're able to match the hunger for compute that OpenAI has. Now, I want to be clear — I believe OpenAI will still continue to use Microsoft's compute, and even expand further into whatever remaining compute Microsoft may have. However, there is now a hard limit on how much of it there's going to be, both literally (in what's physically available) and in what Microsoft itself will actually OpenAI them to use, especially given how unprofitable GPU compute might be. Last week, a truly offensive piece of fan fiction — framed as a "report" — called AI 2027 went viral, garnering press coverage with the Dwarkesh Podcast and gormless, child-like wonder from the New York Times' Kevin Roose. Its predictions vaguely suggest a theoretical company called OpenBrain will invent a self-teaching agent of some sort. It's bullshit, but it captured the hearts and minds of AI boosters because it vaguely suggests that somehow Large Language Models and their associated technology will become something entirely different. I don't like making predictions like these because the future — especially in our current political climate — is so chaotic, but I will say that I do not see, and I say this with complete objectivity, how any of this continues. I want to be extremely blunt with the following points, as I feel like both members of the media and tech analysts have failed to express how ridiculous things have become. I will be repeating myself, but it's necessary, as I need you to understand how untenable things are. I see no way in which OpenAI can continue to raise money at this rate, even if OpenAI somehow actually receives the $40 billion, which will require it becoming a for-profit entity. While it could theoretically stretch that $40 billion to last multiple years, projections say it’ll burn $320 billion in the next five years. Or, more likely, I can’t see a realistic way in which OpenAI gets the resources it needs to survive. It’ll need a streak of unlikely good fortune, the kind of which you only ever hear about in Greek epic poems: If those things happen, I’ll obviously find myself eating crow. But I’m not worried. In the present conditions, OpenAI is on course to run out of money or compute capacity, and it's unclear which will happen first. Even in a hysterical bubble where everybody is agreeing that this is the future, OpenAI currently requires more money and more compute than is reasonable to acquire. Nobody has ever raised as much as OpenAI needs to, and based on the sheer amount of difficulty that SoftBank is having in raising the funds to meet the lower tranche ($10bn) of its commitment, it may simply not be possible for this company to continue. Even with extremely preferential payment terms — months-long deferred payments, for example — at some point somebody is going to need to get paid. I will give Sam Altman credit. He's found many partners to shoulder the burden of the rotten economics of OpenAI, with Microsoft, Oracle, Crusoe and CoreWeave handling the up-front costs of building the infrastructure, SoftBank finding the investors for its monstrous round, and the tech media mostly handling his marketing for him. He is, however, over-leveraged. OpenAI has never been forced to stand on its own two feet or focus on efficiency, and I believe the constant enabling of its ugly, nonsensical burnrate has doomed this company. OpenAI has acted like it’ll always have more money and compute, and that people will always believe its bullshit, mostly because up until recently everybody has. OpenAI cannot "make things cheaper" at this point, because the money has always been there to make things more expensive, as has the compute to make larger language models that burn billions of dollars a year. This company is not built to reduce its footprint in any way, nor is it built for a future in which it wouldn't have access to, as I've said before, infinite resources. Worse still, investors and the media have run cover for the fact that these models don't really do much more than they did a year ago and for the overall diminishing returns of Large Language Models. I have had many people attack my work about OpenAI, but none have provided any real counterpoint to the underlying economic argument I've made since July of last year that OpenAI is unsustainable. This is likely because there really isn't one, other than "OpenAI will continue to raise more money than anybody has ever raised in history, in perpetuity, and will somehow turn from the least-profitable company of all time to a profitable one." This isn’t a rational argument. It’s a religious one. It’s a call for faith. And I see no greater pale horse of the apocalypse than Microsoft's material pullback on data centers. While the argument might be that Microsoft wants OpenAI to have an independent future, that's laughable when you consider Microsoft's deeply monopolistic tendencies — and, for that matter, it owns a massive proportion of OpenAI’s pseudo-equity. At one point, Microsoft’s portion was valued at 49 percent. And while additional fundraising has likely diluted Microsoft’s stake, it still “owns” a massive proportion of what is (at least) the most valuable private startup of all time. And we’re supposed to believe that Microsoft’s pullback — which limits OpenAI’s access to the infrastructure it needs to train and run its models, and thus (as mentioned) represents an existential threat to the company — is because of some paternal desire to see OpenAI leave the childhood bedroom, spread its wings, and enter the real world? Behave. More likely, Microsoft got what it needed out of OpenAI, which has reached the limit of the models it can develop, and which Microsoft already retains the IP of. There’s probably no reason to make any further significant investments, though they allegedly may be part of the initial $10 billion tranche of OpenAI’s next round. It's also important to note that absolutely nobody other than NVIDIA is making any money from generative AI. CoreWeave loses billions of dollars, OpenAI loses billions of dollars, Anthropic loses billions of dollars, and I can't find a single company providing generative AI-powered software that's making a profit. The only companies even close to doing so are consultancies providing services to train and create data for models like Turing and Scale AI — and Scale isn't even profitable. The knock-on effects of OpenAI's collapse will be wide-ranging. Neither CoreWeave nor Crusoe will have tenants for their massive, unsustainable operations, and Oracle will have nobody to sell the compute it’s leased from Crusoe for the next 15 years. CoreWeave will likely collapse under the weight of its abominable debt, which will lead to a 7%+ revenue drop for NVIDIA at a time when revenue growth has already begun to slow. On a philosophical level, OpenAI's health is what keeps this industry alive. OpenAI has the only meaningful userbase in generative AI, and this entire hype-cycle has been driven by its success, meaning any deterioration (or collapse) of OpenAI will tell the market what I've been saying for over a year: that generative AI is not the next hyper-growth market, and its underlying economics do not make sense. I am not writing this to be "right" or "be a hater." If something changes, and I am wrong somehow, I will write exactly how, and why, and what mistakes I made to come to the conclusions I have in this piece. I do not believe that my peers in the media will do the same when this collapses, but I promise you that they will be held accountable, because all of this abominable waste could have been avoided. Large Language Models are not, on their own, the problem. They're tools, capable of some outcomes, doing some things, but the problem, ultimately, are the extrapolations made about their abilities, and the unnecessary drive to make them larger, even if said largeness never amounted to much. Everything that I'm describing is the result of a tech industry — including media and analysts — that refuses to do business with reality, trafficking in ideas and ideology, celebrating victories that have yet to take place, applauding those who have yet to create the things they're talking about, cheering on men lying about what's possible so that they can continue to burn billions of dollars and increase their wealth and influence. I understand why others might not have written this piece. What I am describing is a systemic failure, one at a scale hereto unseen, one that has involved so many rich and powerful and influential people agreeing to ignore reality, and that’ll have crushing impacts for the wider tech ecosystem when it happens.

Nvidia (NVDA) on Monday announced plans to build supercomputers entirely in the U.S., with the chipmaker and its partners set to invest up to $500 billion in American AI infrastructure over the next four years. “The engines of the world’s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a release, adding "American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency.” Nvidia said its supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas, being built in partnership with Foxconn and Wistron, are set to ramp production in the next 12 to 15 months. The chipmaker said its Blackwell chips have already started production at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSM) facilities in Arizona. Nvidia shares were about 1% lower in recent trading, and have fallen about 18% since the start of the year, as concerns about tariffs and other factors have weighed on tech giants.

If you’re reading this, you probably know the value of the Mercury’s news reporting, arts and culture coverage, event calendar, and the bevy of events we host throughout the year. The work we do helps our city shine, but we can’t do it without your support. If you believe Portland benefits from smart, local journalism and arts coverage, please consider making a small monthly contribution, because without you, there is no us. Thanks for your support! GOOD MORNING, PORTLAND!👋 Hallelujah, get ready for a gorgeous, sunny week ahead with highs in the low-to-mid 70s—and I mean, what could be better? Well, how about the Mercury's absolutely delish PIZZA WEEK which starts today Monday, April 14 and runs through this Sunday? Get your one-of-a-kind scrumptious slices for only four damn dollars from Portland's top 68 (!) pizza slingers all week long. Now line up for your one-of-a-kind NEWS. IN LOCAL NEWS: • In a KGW interview, Mayor Keith Wilson announced he is walking back former Mayor Wheeler's plan to cite and arrest homeless citizens, telling Portland Police Chief Bob Day it's not something he supports. "We cannot arrest our way out of unsheltered homelessness," Wilson said in the interview, "...because all you're guaranteeing when you arrest somebody and or cite them or take them into jail is you're ensuring that person's gonna be homeless for another day." (Hard cut to former commissioner and current truck stop lawyer Rene Gonzalez, as he fumes at the end of the bar at Jubitz's Ponderosa Lounge.) When leaders at the Northwest Oregon Labor Council voted to allow the Portland police union to join their ranks, it prompted a sizable controversy among labor and police accountability advocates. The council will now take a wider vote on the issue at the end of the month.[image or embed] • More than 100 students and supporters gathered on the campus of the University of Oregon Friday to demand that the school's administration do more to protect the international students that are being wrongfully and cruelly deported by the racist Trump administration. At least four U of O students have had their visas revoked for bullshit reasons (such as traffic tickets or for vocally supporting Palestine), and protesters are calling for better protection for the students, which includes using the university's alert system to notify everyone when ICE arrives on campus. • Outdoor enthusiast store REI is making a public apology for signing on to a letter that endorsed Trump's controversial pick for secretary of the interior, Doug Burgum. The former North Dakota governor had championed drilling in the Alaska wilderness, supporting coal, and building housing on federal land, and the new CEO of REI (who was not around when the letter was signed) was like, "Oh HELL no!", retracted the endorsement and apologized. Several companies had signed on to the letter which was intended to give them "a seat at the table to continue outdoor recreation advocacy" or more accurately to cravenly lick the boot of the most despicable, anti-environment president we've had in decades... your choice. “We don’t want people that should not be in the profession, bouncing from place to place,” Yamhill County Sheriff Sam Elliott said. “We want to see that finality so that bad apples aren’t able to fly under the radar, so to speak.”[image or embed] • Rescue workers paused their search yesterday for a kayaker who went over Willamette Falls in Oregon City late Saturday night. While the victim's boat was found, the body was not—but, in a chilling twist, during the search another currently unidentified body was found. The search is expected to resume today. • In case you haven't heard, WAR IS HELL. And the new film Warfare (directed by Alex Garland) really hammers the point home in a bloody, excruciatingly tense tale of battle, which our reviewer Dom Sinacola smartly notes is "hyperfocused on war as existential, experiential terror." Is it your cup of tea? Read the review and see! Let's go, trivia lovers! It's time to play POP QUIZ PDX. In this week's local trivia game: the ultimate in unhygienic recycling, inside Portland's "Witch's Castle," and an ode to the shittiest pizza in the world! 🍕😒 See how well YOU score![image or embed] IN NATIONAL/WORLD NEWS: • A Pennsylvania man has been charged with attempted murder and terrorism after setting fire to the home of democratic governor Josh Shapiro, while he and his family were sleeping (thankfully no one was injured). The suspect, Cody Balmer, of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, has not come out and identified himself as a Trumper, but did say he "hated" Shapiro and that if he had confronted the governor, would have beat him to death with a hammer. 😬 • King Fool is threatening the press again, this time going after CBS and its show 60 Minutes, which broadcasted a damning (and absolutely correct) segment on Russia's deadly invasion of Ukraine, and Trump's bizarre threats to take over Greenland. The show infuriated Trump who hopped onto Truth Social to bark that the network would "pay a big price" for going after him reporting truthfully on the news. Trump's poll numbers are plummeting after his disastrous economic policies caused the stock market to crash last week.[image or embed] • Despite all evidence to the contrary, Trump's top physician says that the shambling, presidential pile of bile and Big Macs is in “excellent health.” 😂 While he is currently the oldest person ever elected president, and weighs in at 224 lbs, doctors noted that some of his excess weight can be attributed to Balthamore, the cloven-hooved demon of chaos who currently inhabits his body. Meta is going on trial starting today. The US government is advancing a blockbuster antitrust case, alleging that Mark Zuckerberg’s company illegally built a “social networking monopoly” through years of “anticompetitive conduct.”[image or embed] • Today in grotesque space tourism: Jeff Bezo's "Blue Origin" rocket carried an all female crew (including his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez, TV personality Gayle King, and pop star Katy Perry) for a quick ride into space today, where Perry says she couldn’t resist singing “What a Wonderful World” as she gazed upon the earth below.

Title: Nvidia says it will build AI supercomputers in America for the first time

Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) will begin manufacturing AI supercomputers in the U.S. for the first time, the company announced Monday. The chip manufacturer wrote in a blog post that it has commissioned more than a million square feet of manufacturing space in Arizona and Texas. At the Texas factories, located in Houston and Dallas, Nvidia will build and test AI supercomputers. The chipmaker expects mass production to ramp up there over the next 12 to 15 months. The Arizona plant, located in Phoenix, will be reserved for manufacturing Blackwell chips. Production there has already begun. Nvidia said it plans to invest $500 billion in AI infrastructure over the next four years through its various manufacturing partnerships. “Nvidia AI supercomputers are the engines of a new type of data center created for the sole purpose of processing artificial intelligence — AI factories that are the infrastructure powering a new AI industry,” the company wrote. It added that it expects its manufacturing of AI chips and supercomputers to “create hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive trillions of dollars in economic security” over the next few decades. “The engines of the world’s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in the announcement. “Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain, and boosts our resiliency.” Nvidia previously has touted its AI supercomputers as being capable of allowing anyone to prototype and develop AI models from their personal computers. The company announced the DGX personal AI supercomputers earlier this year. Nvidia stock fell about half a percent following the announcement about its U.S. manufacturing Monday morning. It’s down about 20% on the year in the face of the market uncertainty created by President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

Title: How the Business Community Turned Back Tariffs—for Now

Time Published: 2025-04-14T15:32:06Z

Objections from business leaders played a key role in pushing the Trump Administration to reverse course on recently announced “reciprocal” tariffs, according to Yale SOM leadership expert Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and co-author Stephen Henriques. It’s a win for business, they write, but the business community remains concerned about uncertainty around economic policy. This commentary originally appeared in Time. The views expressed are the authors’ own.‌ It took a mere 13 hours for the Trump administration to cave on their reciprocal tariff scheme. President Donald Trump, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Advisor Peter Navarro did exactly what they said they would not do—“back off” of the non-negotiable trade measures. More perplexing is that no significant trade concession was gained from a single country during the brief period of “maximum leverage.” But a self-congratulatory tone was adopted after announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs.‌ While the President may have been able to confront retaliatory tariffs from foreign partners and diffuse public demonstrations against DOGE actions, he was ultimately unable to stand up to the growing chorus of CEOs condemning his administration’s tariff agenda. Under the threat of aggressor trade tactics, U.S. stocks shed more than $6.5 trillion in two days. And more market pain looked likely as corporate quarterly earnings were just beginning to be released, with growth forecasts being revised downwards. Moreover, Treasury yields and the dollar’s value appeared to be breaking with conventional trade norms during similar periods of crisis, fueling rumors of the two assets losing their coveted “safe-haven” status—and threatening the interest rate discounts on U.S. corporate debt associated with that status. Simply put, CEOs had enough. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon admitted a recession is “a likely outcome” as tariffs were "beyond what people expected." Delta Airlines CEO Ed Bastian pulled the company’s financial forecast for the year “given broad economic uncertainty around global trade.” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told an audience at the Economic Club of New York that most business leaders from his portfolio companies “say we are probably in a recession right now.” These three instances are but a few of the many recent statements of defiance from all corners of the business community, including finance, transportation, housing, autos, technology, and general manufacturing—led by other titans of industry, from Tesla’s Elon Musk to Ford’s Jim Farley to Alcoa’s Bill Oplinger as well as trade association leaders such as Jay Timmons of the National Association of Manufacturers and Suzanne Clark of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ‌ Last month, in fact, at Yale’s CEO Caucus, 100 top CEOs told us they would begin to speak out against Trump if the stock market fell by approximately 20%. Business executives did exactly that as the markets surpassed or flirted with the threshold. Collectively, they punctured the threats and self-inflicted suffering in a challenge directed towards the president. ‌ Despite the moderate trade relief, CEOs remain confused and concerned with the continued delays and whiplash reversals by the administration. The uncertainty has stalled business investment and stymied the potential boon in opportunities from deregulation. Many have expressed a loss of confidence in the president’s economic policy agenda. Trump has placed himself in a precarious situation.‌ In corporate leaders’ minds, the blame rests not only on Trump but also Navarro and Lutnick. Both have lost credibility after reversing course on the negotiability of tariffs. In an interview last week on CNN, Lutnick said, “I don't think there's any chance…President Trump's going to back off his tariffs.” On the same day, Navarro went on air to declare “this [tariff doctrine] is not a negotiation.” The trade advisor then doubled down in an op-ed with the Financial Times. It is Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who adopted the opposite message to his two colleagues in the internal feud over the White House’s trade strategy. ‌ Wednesday’s market relief in response to Trump’s Truth Social post indicates the President may have quelled some of the jitters of nervous traders but not those of CEOs. Business leaders might have stopped him from driving the U.S. economy off a cliff, but it remains teetering on the edge. ‌ The conflicting details from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Bessent, and Trump did not provide business leaders enough confidence to end their pause on capital investments or M&A. After more firm details behind the pause emerged, initial excitement tempered. Some analysts even expect the new tariff policy to be just as economically painful. The 10% base tariff was not rescinded. Tariffs on China were ratcheted up to 145% from 104% as punishment for retaliation, despite the European Union approving retaliatory tariffs of their own hours before. The tariff stance on Canada and Mexico were not affected, nor were existing tariffs on the auto, steel, aluminum, lumber, and other sectors rescinded. Tariffs on the pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries are still reportedly under consideration. ‌ The heightened sense of uncertainty that forced small business confidence to plunge by 50%, labor market conditions to deteriorate, capital spending to stall, and GDP growth forecasts to plummet still remains. Before any reciprocal tariff announcements, 89% of CEOs said at our CEO Caucus in March that they were increasingly concerned the US economy is heading towards a recession, while 69% said the administration would be bad for the economy. Nearly all leaders supported the use of selective tariffs, like most of the American public, but not those that are generalized or reciprocal. And as four-fifths of CEOs reported apologizing for Trump’s behavior to their international counterparts, some of those same longtime foreign trade partners are having exploratory conversations with China to expand commercial ties. ‌ Perhaps Musk best described the current tariff policy on X amid his public feud with Navarro. Musk called Trump’s trade advisor “dumber than a sack of bricks." Seems appropriate, but then again, that characterization might be unfair to bricks. ‌ The trade policy uncertainty continues to present significant challenges for business leaders, disrupting long-term planning, investment decisions, and global supply chain strategies. The recent decision to pause reciprocal tariffs might be a small “win” for leaders. They are hoping the President has learned a lesson here.

Title: Taoiseach hails €1bn-plus ‘Cluas’ light rail project in Cork

Full Content:
Taoiseach Micheál Martin at the launch of the Luas Cork Emerging Preferred Route Public Consultation (Niall Carson/PA) The new €1bn-plus Cork light rail project will prove transformational for the city, the Taoiseach has promised. Micheál Martin was speaking as he launched the eight-week public consultation process on the emerging preferred route for the project, which has already been nicknamed 'Cluas' on Leeside. Luas Cork is a proposed 18km light-rail line with up to 25 stops running from Ballincollig through the city centre to Mahon Point. It will link key Cork destinations such as MTU, Cork University Hospital, UCC, Cork city centre, Kent Station, Cork Docklands, Blackrock and Mahon. The scheme includes a new public transport bridge connecting Kent Station to Kennedy Quay and new cycling infrastructure along much of the route. No overall cost has yet been specified for the scheme but it has been projected at €1bn to €2bn. The emerging preferred route also includes a proposed 1,000-vehicle park & ride facility in Ballincollig and a special mobility hub in Mahon. Taoiseach Micheál Martin at the launch of the Luas Cork Emerging Preferred Route Public Consultation (Niall Carson/PA) News in 90 Seconds - 14 April 2025 When fully operational, it will handle up to 2,300 passengers per hour with a forecast demand of 16 million passengers per annum. There will be no overhead cables in Cork city centre - and 65,000 Cork city residents will live within a 15-minute walk of a Luas stop. It will offer a 20-minute link between Mahon and Cork city centre and 35 minutes from the city centre to Ballincollig. A key element of the plan is a high-quality interchange at Cork's main railway hub, Kent Station. Mr Martin said light rail was vital to cater for the future transport needs of an expanding Cork. It will be the fastest-growing city in Ireland over the next 20 years with a population targeted to grow by 50pc to 60pc as the city strives to become a counterweight to Dublin and the east coast. The Taoiseach refused to specify a timeframe for completion of Luas Cork and said its rate of funding would be determined by future economic and fiscal issues. “Luas Cork will hugely improve connectivity in the city by modernising the city’s public transport network, making it more accessible and creating new opportunities for residents, visitors and local businesses," he said. "This is a very significant day for the public of Cork - this will be a transformative transport project for Cork city. "We are looking overall at a transport investment and network that will meet the needs of a growing city with a huge projected increase in population over the next 20 years. "It is very positive to see this project progressing and from that point of view I would like to acknowledge the work done by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the National Transport Authority and indeed Cork City Council. “With the consultation process now open, I would encourage everybody to take this opportunity to provide their feedback and share their views on this exciting proposal.” Transport Minister Darragh O'Brien said such public transport investments were absolutely crucial for Ireland successfully preparing for future population growth. "The development of Luas Cork will play a key role in achieving this goal. By providing a modern, reliable, and efficient public transport option, Luas Cork will encourage a shift away from private car use, reducing traffic congestion, lowering carbon emissions, and improving air quality." "The project will also complement other sustainable transport initiatives, such as expanded bus services and enhanced cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.” Lord Mayor of Cork Councillor Dan Boyle said the city had been waiting a long time for such a critical investment as Luas Cork. "It is a long-awaited, missing but vital link in the city's transport infrastructure, it will provide real choice to have more people travel by public transport, reduce car dependency, connect key locations and allow for significant additional growth in the development of the city." "The challenge is to see it constructed and operating in the shortest possible time frame." Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Germany's best employers for professional development according to LinkedIn

The Local Europe ABVästmannagatan 43113 25 StockholmSweden Those looking to move to Germany for work this year, or to switch jobs in the country, might take a tip from LinkedIn's best employers ranking. LinkedIn, the online jobs board turned social media platform, published its "top companies" list for 2025 last week, including a ranking of the "25 best large employers for your professional development" in Germany. Germany's jobs market is marked by uncertainty at the moment as its major industries navigate economic stagnation on the domestic market as well as increasing turbulence on global markets. At the same time - and despite a slight uptick in unemployment - there are plenty of opportunities for jobseekers around, as Germany still lacks the skilled workers it needs to fill positions in key industries. 'The best employers for professional development' According to LinkedIn, more than half of professionals worldwide are currently looking to change change jobs or even industries, and many of them are interested in re-tooling their skills and qualifications to help secure their employment into the future. As well as benefits like a good salary and perks, jobseekers also increasingly expect their employer to provide training opportunities and promote their professional development. READ ALSO: The jobs and skills growing in demand across Germany To help candidates find the best opportunities, LinkedIn's ranking took special interest in employers that help employees develop their careers. Here are the top 25 companies in Germany: Notably, many of the top rated firms are manufacturers and software developers. Siemens, which took the number one spot, largely focuses on manufacturing machinery for automation. Its main locations in Germany are in Munich, Nuremberg and Berlin, and the most common job titles it hires for are project managers, software engineers and product managers. Stryker, which was rated second-highest, is a US-based medical equipment manufacturer with German locations in Freiburg and Kiel. It tends to hire sales representatives, manufacturing engineers, and construction administrators, and seeks employees with skills related to biomedical engineering, general surgery and human movement science. Third on the list is ServiceNow, a California-based software development company with locations in Munich, Frankfurt and Berlin. ServiceNow is focused largely on creating AI platforms for companies and tends to seek IT consultants and account managers. How was the ranking determined? The list of top employers in this category was limited to large companies (at 5,000 employees worldwide with at least 500 in Germany). According to LinkedIn, companies were evaluated on eight factors, which included development, skills growth, business stability, external job prospects, business affinity, gender diversity, educational level (of employees) and employer relevance. Companies with a turnover rate above ten percent were also excluded, as were those that had laid off ten percent or more of their workforce since the start of 2024. Interestingly, those constraints made LinkedIn's ranking look quite different from a a Statista survey of Germany's top employers released at the beginning of the year. That survey, commissioned by Stern magazine, saw the drugstore supermarket DM at the top of the list, followed by Adidas and Google Germany. Several automakers also made the list; BMW, Porsche and Audi were all in the top ten. REVEALED: The 'best' German companies to work for in 2025 Some of those companies were likely omitted from LinkedIn's ranking due to recently announced layoffs, such as those at the above mentioned car makers and Adidas.

Title: Pfizer just had a big setback in its race for an Ozempic competitor

Time Published: 2025-04-14T14:44:00Z

Pfizer (PFE+1.16%) announced Monday that it is ending development of its daily weight-loss pill following a liver injury to a patient participating in a trial. The patient, who was asymptomatic, recovered after they stopped taking the medication, according to a statement from the U.S.-based pharmaceutical giant. While the statement didn’t directly say the participant’s liver enzymes were elevated, it pointed out that “the overall frequency of liver enzyme elevations across the over 1,400 participant safety database of danuglipron is in-line with approved agents in the class.” This can often indicate damage to liver cells, an issue that has been linked to other weight-loss drugs, according to CNBC. “While we are disappointed to discontinue the development of danuglipron, we remain committed to evaluating and advancing promising programs in an effort to bring innovative new medicines to patients,” Pfizer chief scientific officer Dr. Chris Boshoff said in the release, adding that the company will continue developing other weight-loss drugs. Pfizer said that data from the trial will still be submitted to the scientific community for further study. Pfizer was developing danuglipron, an oral GLP-1 drug, as something of a rival to Ozempic and Wegovy, both of which are manufactured by Denmark-based Novo Nordisk (NVO+2.41%). Early trials had shown that Pfizer’s pill resulted in about as much weight loss as Wegovy. An oral weight-loss medication would be far less invasive than the injections required by most GLP-1s. Like Pfizer, pharma giants including Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly (LLY+3.00%), and AstraZeneca (AZN+2.93%) are working on their own oral weight-loss pills. Viking Therapeutics (VKTX+9.59%), a San Diego-based pharma company, has also shown promising results in early trials. Despite the setback, Pfizer’s stock was up 0.9% Monday morning. Eli Lilly rose 1.6%, and Novo Nordisk rose 2.5%. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: President Trump: The Tariff Czar. Tariffs Impact Whose Economies?
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/trump-tariff-czar-tariffs-impact-whose-economies/5884350
Time Published: 2025-04-14T13:52:28Z
Full Content:
President Trump called 2 April 2025 “Liberation Day” because this is the day when he announced new sweeping tariffs across the board, meaning, indeed, on all countries across the world. He might as well have called it “Day of Reckoning.” Did it signal the beginning of a global trade war? Or, is it just a game by which self-centered President Trump wants to show-off again, as being the one who commands the game, the one who can bend the world to its knees. Or so, he believes. But at what cost? And for whom to pay the cost? It is a dangerous game, more a gamble than a game. It is the gamble of a typical deal-maker – the extreme is “lose it all,” that is the direction this is going or win it all. “Win it all” for Trump, i.e. the US, is no option. There are too many smarter players around the globe. By now, at least 75 countries are begging Trump to “negotiate” bilateral tariff structures. It is not so much a question of cost for the partner countries, but for the US themselves. Washington has much more to lose than the rest of the world. Trump’s aim seems clear: 1) bring back outsourced manufacturing to the US; and 2) attract foreign new investments for manufacturing in the US, with significant tax breaks for new investors. The cost of either option is astronomical, and even if some countries / corporations are willing to take the risk of moving their manufacturing from a low-wage to a high-wage country – it doesn’t happen overnight. What happens in the meantime when new markets must be found? Who needs US goods? They hardly produce anything. Most everything you buy in the US is “made in China.” Even Trump’s red MAGA hat is “made in China.” American consumers will suffer the most. A couple of days ago, Trump increased tariffs for Chinese imports from 84% to 125%. He said, attempting to justify his move before the rest of the world, increased duties are intended to make China realize that “ripping off the USA and other countries is no longer sustainable or acceptable.” On his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote that this was “based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the world’s markets.” Interesting though, how come everybody buys Chinese goods, not just because they are cheaper than US and other western goods, but also because Chinese quality in many cases is way superior. Chinese production is not subject to the US and western traditional corruption. Just look at the hundreds of billions-worth of corruption scandals the European Union (EU) is involved in, especially the unelected President Ursula Von der Leyen, or shall we say Dr. Von der Leyen, as in June 2022, she received an honorary doctorate from the Israeli Ben-Gurion University. See video below and this. Ms. von der Leyen said to her doctorate award: “Our democracy flourishes if Jewish life in Europe flourishes, too. Throughout the centuries, the Jewish people have been ‘a light unto the nations’. And they shall be a light unto Europe for many centuries ahead. (…) Long live Europe! Am Israel Chai!” Amen. This made Ursula Von der Leyen a forever Zionist, forever protected by the Zionists ruling the world; like President Trump when in 2017 he converted to Judaism. She is now not only guarded against several lawsuits, because the EU grants her diplomatic immunity, indeed also protecting her buddies-in-crime; but now she is also protected by the ever-Chosen People, the Zionists of Israel and around the world. * Back to the tariff game that must go on. It is an utterly destructive game in the end for the US, but a game it is. And China plays along. Good for China, who does not need the US market as much as the US market needs China. China makes believe gambling in tandem with Trump. China just upped the ante. They increased their tariffs for US goods also to 125% – however saying, that is it. No higher. No matter what Trump does, we will not increase tariffs any further. In casino lingo that means, “Les jeux sont faits”. See this. Trump is – again – shooting from the hips. Or was and is it a plan? If it is a planned game, it could backfire miserably for the US. But Trump seems wanting to keep the game going, like a drunken gambler. In this game or gamble, the biggest players are China and to a lesser extent the EU. The EU is considering retaliation tariffs of 25%; while most individual EU countries talk about 20%. For now, tariffs are suspended for 90 days on both sides of the Atlantic, as negotiations are being “prepared”. The EU is divided. There are those who say enough is enough, let us open up to China and Asia in general. Eurasia is a natural partner and an already well-structured market. Forget the oppressive US of A. Others cannot believe that the US may drop the EU, and still want to adhere to this losing game by tallying up to Mr. Trump’s Washington. In the end, Europe has never been an independent force on her own – thousands of years of exploitation, back to the Roman Empire, and before, colonizing others, up to this very day. They will eventually fall by their own weight into the abyss created between the two fronts. Just in case, an EU retaliation would have similar effects on the European consumer – at a variation, depending on the importance of US imports for European consumers. This maybe the reason for EU’s semi-clandestine approach to China for increasing trade with China – of course, officially a “no-no”, according to the EU’s own copycat sanctioning of China, as dictated by the Trump Administration. For China, the game is already won. China for years has oriented its market towards Asia, the ASEAN countries, including the world’s largest free trade agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), comprising of 15 Asia-Pacific nations. The agreement, under preparation for ten years, entered into force on 1 January 2022, encompasses about a third of the world’s population and a third of the world’s GDP. The value of RCEP trade is expected to reach the equivalent of about third of the world’s GDP by 2030. China also has the Belt and Road Infrastructure, Investment and Trade Initiative spanning the globe, independently of Trump’s tariff fiasco. In addition, China, a cofounder of BRICS, is strongly committed to BRICS-plus inter-trading, as well as with the Global South (GS) in general. The GS will soon outstrip economic parameters of the G7. In Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), the GS is already stronger than the G7. China has no market problem without the US. But the US are likely heading towards enormous internal socioeconomic problems, without Chinese goods or high duties on Chinese goods which make them unaffordable to the American consumer – especially middle and lower end consumers. Inflation and unemployment will be soaring. But the tariff game continues. It is a destructive game for the US, but a game it is. And China plays along. China does not really need the US market as much as the US market needs China. Everything in the US is “made in China.” You stop the “Made in China” by ridiculous tariffs and the US comes to a standstill – because of inflation, labor loss and an uprooting of the American society – they may not take it. Specially the middle-lower income levels are losing sizable amounts of their purchasing power as compared with their 2024 incomes. Some analysts are comparing Trump to the stubborn Roman emperors. He cannot succeed. Irrespective of whether Trump politically survives his brutal tariff offensive, a U-turn is imminent, if he wants to avoid major domestic upheavals. The Budget Lab, a research center at Yale University, had estimated the toll on the average household at about US$ 3,800 annually, as compared with the spending power of 2024. See this for what it means in terms of inflation or consumer loss in 2024 US incomes. At the same time, Trump announced a military budget of about a trillion US dollars. This is brilliant logic of an extravagant megalomaniac. Or is there something else behind it? Are the global tariffs and the war budget deviously linked? According to the Budget Lab study, accumulated 2025 US import tariffs were scheduled to grow higher than ever since 1909. The stock market cratering alone wiped out about US$ 5 trillion. Since the first announcement of the tariff shock, the stock market has been like a roller-coaster. Some of the more significant market losses may be recuperated as Trump will negotiate bilaterally; or more, in case he will have to make an inevitable U-turn. Whatever you may call it, it is at best: “Radical policy changes” and an “unpredictable disruption.” In the light of the just announced one trillion US-dollar war budget, the imminent question arising: Is this game supposed to hide the fact that Trump is unable, or never was really willing, to achieve peace, neither in Ukraine, nor in the Middle East, because the profit stakes are too high for the war industry, and – possessing Ukraine and her riches is just too tempting to let it go. BlackRock has already privatized about half the country without most Ukrainians, let alone the rest of the world – noticing. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Goldman Sachs earnings jump but CEO sees 'markedly different' environment coming

Goldman Sachs (GS+1.93%) opened the floodgates on first-quarter earnings Monday, reporting a 15% jump in profit to $4.74 billion, or $14.12 per share. Strong trading revenues fueled the beat, and shares climbed 1.7% at the open — despite being down about 14% year-to-date. CEO David Solomon struck a confident tone while acknowledging extreme uncertainty amid chaotic U.S. policy turns. “In times of great uncertainty, clients turn to Goldman Sachs for execution and insight,” he said, while noting that Q2 has brought “a markedly different operating environment.” Goldman’s performance is a reminder that Wall Street firms often find ways to thrive in turmoil. As a barometer of capital flows and investor sentiment, the bank’s earnings show that volatility, while unsettling, isn’t always unprofitable. The strong showing adds to solid reports from other financial giants last week, including BlackRock (BLK+2.04%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM-0.63%) and Morgan Stanley (MS+1.48%). Still, clouds are forming: analysts at both Morgan Stanley and Citigroup (C+3.39%) cut their year-end S&P 500 targets, warning of slowing earnings, geopolitical instability, and unpredictable U.S. policy. With heavyweight companies like Netflix (NFLX+2.09%), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ+1.73%), and UnitedHealth (UNH-1.96%) reporting in the days ahead, investors will be watching closely to see whether the bounce continues — or buckles under pressure.

Trump's tariff uncertainties lead to a draining investment landscape for crypto assets, except for rising XRP. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The digital asset market faced another challenging week, with $795 million in outflows recorded across crypto investment products, according to CoinShares‘ latest weekly report. This marks the third consecutive week of declines, underlining growing caution among investors navigating global economic headwinds. The ongoing streak of negative sentiment has pushed total outflows since early February to $7.2 billion. These withdrawals have nearly erased 2025’s earlier gains, leaving net inflows for the year at a modest $165 million. CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill, noted that much of the recent investor caution stems from renewed tariff tensions involving the United States and China. Last week, the United States and China reignited their tariff dispute, each imposing a 25% levy on incoming goods. While President Donald Trump briefly paused broader tariff actions for 90 days, the damage to investor sentiment had already been done. CoinShares noted that short-term relief helped digital assets under management (AuM) climb to $130 billion, an 8% rebound from the April 8 low, the lowest level since November 2024. According to the report, Bitcoin products experienced $751 million in outflows, although the asset still maintains $545 million in year-to-date inflows. Major Bitcoin ETF issuers, including BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity, saw significant fund exits during this period. Short Bitcoin products also experienced $4.6 million in outflows, suggesting that investors aren’t simply rotating into bearish positions. Meanwhile, Ethereum posted the second-largest outflows at $37.6 million, while other altcoins such as Solana, Aave, and Sui also saw declines of $5.1 million, $780,000, and $580,000, respectively. However, not all assets followed the trend. XRP continued to draw in fresh capital with inflows of $3.5 million last week, boosting its year-to-date inflows to $176 million, making it one of the best-performing digital assets in 2025. XRP’s inflow this year can be linked to the growing optimism over potential regulatory reforms and speculation around a spot XRP ETF in the US. Other altcoins, including Ondo, Algorand, and Avalanche, posted modest inflows of around $250,000 each, showing that niche investor interest in select assets remains intact despite broader market weakness.

Title: Big Tech can breathe a sigh of relief — for now

Good morning. A business owner bought a Cybertruck last year to advertise her company. Now, she's one of many cybertruck owners facing growing hostility and threats of violence. "I paid over $400 to teach my staff self-defense," she writes. Read the full story. In today's newsletter, the tech industry received some welcome news over the weekend — sort of. What's on deck Markets: The spasm in the Treasury market last week was a warning for Trump and the US. Tech: Microsoft just tapped the brakes on its AI data center expansion. Is that a bad sign? Business: Elon Musk's marketing strategy for Tesla made showrooms a "sitting duck" for protesters. But first, Big Tech dares to dream. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Confusion abounds this morning. On Friday, the US Customs and Border Protection said devices like smartphones, computers, and memory chips would be exempt from higher tariffs. "This is the dream scenario for tech investors," Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, posted on X. "Smartphones, chips being excluded is a game-changer scenario when it comes to China tariffs." Global tech titans breathed a sigh of relief … for a moment. Trump took to Truth Social on Sunday with some clarifications. "NOBODY is getting 'off the hook'," he wrote, adding: "Especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!" Trump denied there were ever actually exemptions from tariffs because a previous tariff is still in place. "There was no Tariff 'exception'," Trump wrote. "These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket.'" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Trump's comments during an interview with ABC News on Sunday, saying that tech products would be subject to tariffs after an investigation into the effect importing vital tech components has on national security So, not quite an exemption — but exempt-ish. It was still welcome news for Big Tech. As chaotic as the messaging over the weekend was, certain tech products are no longer exposed to the 145% reciprocal tariff on China. US stock futures are up early Monday, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rising as much as 1.4%. Apple is up more than 5% in premarket trading. 1. A historic week for markets. Stocks plunged and soared every day last week as Wall Street tried to gauge the impact of Trump's shifting tariffs. BI recapped investors' roller coaster ride. 2. The bond market has flashed a warning sign for the US and Trump. Intense volatility in the usually safe bond market put pressure on President Trump to partly pause the trade war last week. A sell-off in US Treasurys pushed bond yields to their highest level since January. 3. A top strategist is waiting for a stock surge. Piper Sandler's Craig Johnson isn't backing down from his high price target for the S&P 500, even despite current volatility. Here's why he still expects it to surge to 6,600 by year-end. 1. Vibe coding is changing the game for investors and founders. Traditionally, VCs have leaned toward software startup founders with coding expertise. Now, as AI tools pitch in, they have shifting expectations. 2. Tech investors feel a funding chill coming on. The AI boom sparked further interest in tech, but recent market turmoil is prompting some VC firms to hold back on big deals. The whole thing feels a bit like "Groundhog Day," one emerging fund manager told BI. 3. Microsoft took its foot off the AI accelerator. Should we be worried? Microsoft has backed away from data center expansion even though the pace of AI investment hasn't slowed a bit. The move is a troubling step, but it's a strategic recalibration, not a retreat, BI's Alistair Barr writes. 1. Tesla's big blue blunder. Elon Musk's marketing strategy of putting Tesla showrooms in the middle of cities' liberal enclaves has now backfired big-time. Being in high-traffic zones has made the showrooms a sitting duck for protesters. 2. It's easier than ever for businesses to jack up prices. Thanks to a whipsawing economy and modern technology, businesses can now change prices at the drop of a hat. Consumers don't always know why the hikes are happening — and they're exhausted. 3. Teens still <3 Chick-fil-A. The chicken chain is teens' favorite restaurant brand, according to a recent Piper Sandler survey. Chick-fil-A has held the first place spot for seven years in a row, the investment bank told BI, consistently beating out McDonald's.

Title: Trump's trade war is eroding US billionaires' fortunes — while China's are getting even richer

America's tech titans have lost billions this year while their Chinese rivals have racked up large wealth gains amid President Donald Trump's tariff-induced trade war. The tariffs have reignited fears of inflation and recession in the US, spurring investors to dump high-flying tech stocks in favor of safer holdings such as gold and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The sell-off has hammered the net worths of most of the richest Americans, whose stakes in tech companies make up the vast majority of their wealth. Trump has aimed some of the highest duties at imports from China, putting the world's second-largest economy under more pressure. Nevertheless, Chinese tech stocks have rallied strongly this year at the prospect of friendlier regulation and fresh government stimulus, boosting the fortunes of China's tech elite. As of Friday's close, the 20 biggest gainers on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index have grown their combined wealth by $139 billion this year — more than BlackRock is worth. Meanwhile, the 20 largest wealth losers have seen $450 billion vaporized, a figure greater than Exxon Mobil's market value. It's striking that nine of the top 20 gainers are Chinese and only four are American, while 15 of the 20 biggest losers are American and none are Chinese. That trend may speak to how their companies' outlooks have changed, at least in the eyes of the global investment community, and how the US and China are expected to fare in the trade war. The Chinese executives racking up wealth this year include Bytedance founder Zhang Yiming, Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun, and BYD founder Wang Chuanfu. They've jointly added a combined $26 billion, with Zhang gaining $13.6 billion, or 31%, to $57 billion — putting him in 24th place on the rich list. The US bosses hit hardest are Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. They've lost a collective $193 billion, with Musk shedding $121 billion or 28%. The richest Americans have lost far more than the Chinese elite have gained for a few reasons. Their fortunes are larger, so a 10% swing in their net worth is a bigger move in dollar terms. US stocks as a whole are more richly valued than Chinese equities, making them more vulnerable to steeper declines. It's also worth underscoring the greater role of the Chinese government in shoring up its markets and supporting domestic champions, which can help to limit declines in Chinese stocks. Vladimir Popov, a principal researcher at the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute in Moscow, told Business Insider that China's more equal income and wealth distribution and more collectivist culture than the US were key to its global competitiveness — and thus the wealth of its richest executives. The economic development scholar added that China having fewer billionaires than the US, who wield less political influence than their American counterparts, help it to weather trade wars, probably because it's easier to maintain a united front. Chinese billionaires' wealth gains also reflect their companies' strong progress. For example, BYD's sales of electric and hybrid vehicles surged by 40% to a record $107 billion last year, surpassing Tesla's revenues of $98 billion, as the Chinese EV maker made inroads into foreign markets. Meanwhile, Tesla stock is under pressure not only because of Musk's proximity to Trump and leading role in cutting government spending and workers, but also because of concerns about tariffs and competition. Politics aside, Tesla has "struggled with an ageing line up, recalls of its much-vaunted Cybertruck and increased competition, especially from Chinese players like BYD," said Danni Hewson of AJ Bell in a recent note. If Chinese executives scale the global wealth ladder while American titans slide down the rungs, it could signal a sea change in market sentiment — and an upheaval of the global economic order.

Title: Apple, Dell, and Goldman Sachs: Stocks to watch today

A Nasdaq bounce looks to be brewing on Monday after U.S. officials moved to temporarily exempt smartphones, laptops, and other high-end electronics from the Trump administration’s sweeping 145% tariffs on Chinese imports. The European tech sector signaled strength earlier in the morning, and stateside, Apple (AAPL+2.21%) shares jumped more than 6%, Dell (DELL+4.44%) surged over 7%, and Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) and Intel (INTC+2.89%) each climbed over 3% in early trading. The rally reflects just how sensitive markets remain to even short-lived tariff clarity. But that clarity may be fleeting. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said over the weekend that while consumer electronics are spared from reciprocal tariffs, they’re still on track to face new levies — set to hit “in probably a month or two.” Meanwhile, Apple grabbed headlines for a different reason: taking the global top spot in smartphone shipments for the first quarter of 2025. Strong demand for the iPhone 16e in Japan and India helped push Apple ahead of Samsung and its Chinese rivals. Even as supply chain concerns persist, Apple’s global brand power remains formidable. Following strong results from mega-banks last week, Goldman Sachs (GS+1.93%) reported a 15% jump in profit to $4.74 billion, or $14.12 per share, before Monday’s market open. Strong trading revenues drove the beat, and shares rose 2% in early trading. But Goldman’s performance is also a reminder: Wall Street firms often find ways to thrive in chaos. As a barometer for capital flows and market confidence, Goldman’s beat underscores how volatility, while unsettling, isn’t always unprofitable. Despite Monday’s bounce, market outlooks are getting darker. Analysts at Morgan Stanley (MS+1.48%) and Citigroup (C+3.39%) both slashed their year-end targets for U.S. equities, citing decelerating earnings growth, global instability, and increasingly erratic policy moves. With major names like Netflix (NFLX+2.09%), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ+1.73%), and UnitedHealth (UNH-1.96%) reporting this week, investor mood may hinge on whether the fundamentals hold — or whether Monday’s premarket optimism proves to be another false dawn.

Title: Meta faces antitrust trial that could force it to break off Instagram, WhatsApp

Time Published: 2025-04-14T12:49:36Z

Menu Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, "expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats." IN CASE YOU MISSED IT | Meta agrees to pay $25 million to settle lawsuit from Trump after Jan. 6 suspension Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. “Unable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company’s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,” the FTC says. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. FROM THE ARCHIVES | Is WhatsApp safe? Here's what you need to know WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. “The FTC already has the difficult task, whether it’s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we’re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,” said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. “And I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.” Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC’s lawsuit “defies reality.” “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI," the company said in a statement. IN CASE YOU MISSED IT | FTC's rule banning fake online reviews goes into effect In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC “must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past." This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. Boasberg “seems to be skeptical” of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a “fact question," which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram.

The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Meta faces historic antitrust trial that could force it to break off Instagram, WhatsApp

By BRIAN WITTE and BARBARA ORTUTAY, AP Technology Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand on Monday in a historic antitrust trial that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The Federal Trade Commission called Zuckerberg as its first witness, as it seeks to prove that Meta acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to preserve its monopoly in the social networking space. In opening statements, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson said Meta has used its position to generate enormous profits even as consumer satisfaction has dropped. He said Meta was “erecting a moat” to protect its interests by buying the two startups because the company feared they were a threat to Meta’s dominance. Zuckerberg and other key Meta witnesses will testify throughout the trial. “We’re going to give them their chance to tell their side of the story,” Matheson said. Mark Hansen, an attorney for Meta, said the FTC was making a “grab bag” of arguments that were wrong. He said Meta has plenty of competition and has made improvements to the startups it acquired. “This lawsuit, in summary, is misguided,” Hansen said, adding: “anyway you look at it, consumers have been the big winners.” The trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump’s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing Zuckerberg’s strategy, “expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. “Unable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company’s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,” the FTC says. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750 million after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta’s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. “The FTC already has the difficult task, whether it’s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we’re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,” said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. “And I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.” Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC’s lawsuit “defies reality.” “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,” the company said in a statement. In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC “must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.” This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta’s fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta’s request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. Boasberg “seems to be skeptical” of the FTC’s narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a “fact question,” which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it’s forced to spin off Instagram. Meta isn’t the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google’s case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August.

Title: Kennedy Wilson refinances €472m of Irish apartment portfolio debt

Full Content:
Kennedy Wilson, the US-based property investment giant, has secured a refinancing deal for $510 million (€472 million) related to debts secured against a portfolio of Irish apartments that were due to mature this year. The group, which last year sold its stake in Dublin’s five-star Shelbourne Hotel to Archer Hotel Capital for around €260 million, said the new five-year deal replaces an existing $537 million mortgage, which represented around 40 per cent of its total debt maturities for 2025. The debt is secured against several high-profile apartment schemes in the Republic, primarily in Dublin, comprising 1,689 units, or just under half of Kennedy Wilson’s 3,500-unit Irish portfolio. The properties – including Clancy Quay in Islandbridge, Dublin 8, the luxury Grange East scheme in Blackrock, as well as the Elysian in Cork – are co-owned by Kennedy Wilson and the investment arm of insurer Axa through a joint venture company. Occupancy rates across the portfolio are 99.5 per cent and the assets produce an annual operating income of around $40.3 million, Kennedy Wilson said on Monday in US Securities and Exchange (SEC) filings. The interest rate on the new financing is 4.2 per cent, according to the SEC documents. In a separate statement, the California-headquartered group said it had secured competitive terms from new lenders Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank. “This refinancing process satisfied a large 2025 maturity for Kennedy Wilson and generated extremely strong market interest,” Mike Pegler, president of Kennedy Wilson Europe said. “We secured competitive terms from a diverse pool of over 30 potential lenders, including both local and international banks, insurers and debt funds. This is a testament to the quality of this portfolio as well as the underlying strength of the apartment market in Ireland, where we have invested since 2012.” The Irish Times reported in March that Kennedy Wilson was looking to secure upwards of €145 million from the sale of two prime office investments in Dublin’s city centre and docklands. CBRE and Knight Frank have been tasked by the US property giant with finding a buyer for 20 Kildare Street, which houses tenants includingAra Partners, Consello, Davidson Kempner Capital Management, Dentons, Egon Zehnder and Lanthorn and generates a rent roll of around €4 million annually. It is also understood to have instructed CBRE and Savills to sell office accommodation at Capital Dock, the landmark mixed-use scheme in Dublin’s south docklands.

Title: Stocks rise as Apple jumps and Goldman beats on earnings. But fears linger beneath the bounce

U.S. stocks edged up Monday as investors digested mixed messages on the trade war, following some of the most chaotic and turbulent weeks in recent market memory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 312 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 added 42 points, also climbing 0.8% by market close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 107 points, or 0.6%. Gold, meanwhile, slipped 0.8%, suggesting a slight pullback from last week’s mad dash into safe-haven assets. Apple (AAPL+2.21%) stock climbed, helping lead market indexes higher. A surprise tariff announcement late Friday triggered the tech-led bounce on Monday. The electronics exemption, issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, seemed to shield smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics from Trump administration tariffs on Chinese goods — offering relief for companies that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing, such as Apple, Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%), and Microsoft (MSFT+0.24%) But the reprieve may be short-lived. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the products are still included under a round of semiconductor-related tariffs “coming in probably a month or two.” And President Donald Trump later rejected the idea that there had been any exemption at all, saying that the goods are still subject to existing 20% fentanyl-linked tariffs and that they had merely shifted tariff categories. He said no product was actually exempt, calling the change a simple reclassification. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” Trump said Sunday on his social media site Truth Social. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts criticized the shifting policies as “chaos and corruption,” warning that such unpredictability is eroding investor confidence. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Fear & Greed Index is still planted in “extreme fear” territory, reflecting a lack of bullish sentiment amid chaotic policy announcements — to say nothing of chaotic policy determination. The S&P 500’s recent 5% intraday swings suggest volatility that is more structural than seasonal. Analysts at both Morgan Stanley (MS+1.48%) and Citigroup (C+3.39%) have cut their year-end forecasts for U.S. stocks, pointing to rising risks from such unpredictable policy moves and continuing geopolitical tensions. Heading into a packed week of corporate earnings in which major banks, healthcare companies, and consumer-facing platforms such as Netflix (NFLX+2.09%) will report results, each release could either steady or rattle investor nerves. Apple stock jumped 2.2% Monday, lifted by hopes the company will be temporarily exempt from new electronics tariffs. President Trump said Monday afternoon that he was “flexible” when it came to a temporary exemption for Apple. Separately, Apple reclaimed the top spot in global smartphone shipments for the first quarter of 2025, thanks to strong demand for the iPhone 16e in markets such as Japan and India. Even alongside valid fears of disruptions to Apple’s supply chain, the company’s product suite and global brand power remain unmatched. Goldman Sachs (GS+1.93%) reported a robust 15% increase in first-quarter profit, reaching $4.74 billion, or $14.12 per share, driven by strong trading performance amid market volatility. Goldman stock rose 1.9% Monday. But it’s not just about one earnings beat. Goldman is a bellwether for how corporate America is handling volatility, providing a real-time pulse check on capital flows and investor sentiment in a year that’s been anything but normal. On Monday, it’s a reminder that Wall Street firms may make money whether times are good or bad. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump’s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s strategy, “expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. “Unable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company’s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,” the FTC says. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750 million after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta’s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. “The FTC already has the difficult task, whether it’s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we’re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,” said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. “And I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.” Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC’s lawsuit “defies reality.” “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.

Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,” the company said in a statement. In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC “must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.” This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta’s fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta’s request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. Boasberg “seems to be skeptical” of the FTC’s narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a “fact question,” which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it’s forced to spin off Instagram. “Instagram is now Meta’s biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company’s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,” said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. “The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn’t where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.” But Meta isn’t the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google’s case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 04/14 update below. This post was originally published on April 13 Donald Trump’s escalating global trade war has pushed markets to the brink this week, causing a spiralling U.S. dollar "confidence crisis" amid fears of "collapse." Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The Federal Reserve, which stepped in to calm markets during the Covid panic, is closely watching the $29 trillion Treasury market for signs convulsions caused by Trump’s tariffs could turn into a full-blown financial crisis (while Wall Street braces for a looming “existential” threat). Now, as Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issues a surprise prediction, a top Federal Reserve official has said it “would absolutely be prepared" to step in to rescue markets if U.S. president Trump’s trade war threatens the financial system. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has triggered chaos on financial markets with his on-again, off-again ... More trade war, tanking stock markets and sending the bitcoin price and crypto markets on a rollercoaster. “We have had to deploy quite quickly, various tools,” Susan Collins, head of the Boston Fed, told the Financial Times, referring to previous times the Fed has moved to calm chaotic markets at times of low liquidity or market malfunctions. “We would absolutely be prepared to do that as needed.” However, Collins, who fears Trump’s tariff trade war could send inflation back above 3% in 2025, said that currently “markets are continuing to function well” and that “we’re not seeing liquidity concerns overall," adding the Fed “does have tools to address concerns about market functioning or liquidity should they arise.” 04/14 update: JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has predicted the Federal Reserve will be forced to step in and bail out the near-$30 trillion U.S. Treasury market following U.S. president Donald Trump’s campaign of rapid-fire global tariffs. “There will be a kerfuffle in the Treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations,” Dimon said in a Friday earnings call, warning that the Fed won’t act until “they start to panic a little bit." Dimon suggested the Fed could ditch a rule that exempts Treasuries from leverage ratio calculations, something that would allow institutional investors to buy more bonds without breaking capital requirement rules. “If they don’t [change the rules], the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea,” Dimon said. The suggestion has been seized on as bullish by Bitmex cofounder and Maelstrom chief investment officer Arthur Hayes, who posted to X that: “What Jamie Dimon wants, Jamie Dimon gets.” "[Supplementary leverage ratio] exemption is what we need to send BTC orbital," Hayes added. Earlier this month, traders ramped up their bets that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates to stave off a U.S. recession—something that could see the market “flooded” with dollars—though Collins said emergency rate cuts would not be the Fed’s primary tool for responding to market’s failing. In 2020, ahead of one of the largest ever stock market rallies that saw the bitcoin price and crypto market surge to never-before-seen heights, the Fed restarted its 2008 financial crisis-era programs of quantitative easing while cutting rates to near-zero and scrapping its cap on the number of Treasuries it could buy—fueling expectations the Fed could again turbo charge the bitcoin price. “I still believe bitcoin can hit $250,000 by year-end because now that the [U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent] has put [Fed chair Jerome] Powell in his place, the Fed will flood the market with dollars,” Arthur Hayes, a cofounder of crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex, wrote in a blog post. Collins’ comments come as the New York Fed’s John Williams has warned that Trump’s tariffs could send inflation spiralling, caused a wave of unemployment and damage U.S. economic growth. This coming week, Fed chair Jerome Powell, who is at loggerheads with Trump over the need for interest rate cuts, is due to speak at the Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday in what will be a closely-watched speech. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dropped back from its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set ahead of Donald ... More Trump's inauguration as global markets convulse over Trump's trade tariffs. Trump’s fast-moving approach to tariffs and trade negotiation—that’s seen China hit with levies of almost 150% before a carve out was announced for smartphones, computers and some other electronics—has seen the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield jump 0.5 percentage points to 4.5% over the past week, spooking markets with its outsized swings. Crypto and stock markets have been on a rollercoaster that’s caused some of the most extreme volatility ever seen. After Trump announced a 90-day pause on some reciprocal tariffs, the S&P 500 posted its third-largest one-day gain since World War II, while the Nasdaq had its second-best session ever following a steep multi-trillion dollar sell-off. The notoriously volatile bitcoin price and crypto market has swung from highs of $3 trillion late March to lows of $2.5 trillion in early April before rebounding back toward $3 trillion. Meanwhile, business leaders on Wall Street and across the U.S. are warning the economy is buckling under the pressure of tariff uncertainty. BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has warned the U.S. may already be in a recession due to Trump’s sweeping tariffs while JPMorgan’s chief executive Jamie Dimon has said recession is the “likely outcome” of Trump’s trade war.

LAST UPDATE | 14 Apr THE EMERGING PREFERRED Route for Luas Cork has been launched today by Taoiseach Micheál Martin and is open to public consultation for the next eight weeks. Luas Cork is a proposed 18km long light rail line with up to 24 stops running from Ballincollig to Mahon Point. It will connect key destinations such as MTU, Cork University Hospital, UCC, Cork city centre, Kent Station, Cork Docklands, Blackrock and Mahon. Luas Cork route map The scheme also includes a new public transport bridge connecting Kent Station to Kennedy Quay and new cycling infrastructure along much of the route. The Emerging Preferred Route also includes a proposed 1000 vehicle Park & Ride facility in Ballincollig and a Mobility Hub in Mahon. Cork is planned to be the fastest-growing city in Ireland over the next 20 years, with a population targeted to grow by 50 to 60% and projects such as Luas Cork are seen as vital to delivering the large-scale regeneration and investment planned for Cork. Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) and the National Transport Authority (NTA) is inviting the public to participate in the consultation on www.luascork.ie. The consultation is open until Monday 9 June at 5.30pm. There will also be a number of open days across the city during the consultation where drawings can be inspected and staff from TII will be available to answer questions. Martin described the announcement today of the Emerging Preferred Route a “significant step in an infrastructure project that will be transformational for Cork city”. He added that it is government’s plan to do “whatever we can effectively and in a timely matter”. Advertisement Martin said the project will “modernise the city’s public transport network, making it more accessible and creating new opportunities for residents, visitors and local businesses”. “With the consultation process now open, I’d encourage everybody to take this opportunity to provide their feedback and share their views,” said Martin. Meanwhile, Transport Minister Darragh O’Brien TD noted that Cork has been selected by the European Commission as one of Europe’s first climate-neutral cities. In 2022, the European Commission announced that Cork is to become one of Europe’s first climate neutral cities. Cork, along with Dublin, was selected from a group of 337 cities to participate in the EU Mission for 100 climate-neutral cities by 2030. “The development of Luas Cork will play a key role in achieving this goal,” said O’Brien. “Luas Cork will encourage a shift away from private car use, reducing traffic congestion, lowering carbon emissions, and improving air quality. “The project will also complement other sustainable transport initiatives, such as expanded bus services and enhanced cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.” O’Brien, who last month said the Luas Cork could cost between €2 billion and €3 billion, added that it’s “very difficult to estimate” how much the project will cost. Lord Mayor of Cork City Dan Boyle meanwhile remarked that the “challenge is to see it constructed and operating in the shortest possible time frame”. Elsewhere, Hugh Creegan, interim CEO of the NTA said that Luas Cork will be the “new era of public transport which will enable Cork to develop into an accessible, connected and vibrant city” while Peter Walsh, CEO of TII, said he looked forward to hearing from the public before progressing to the next stage of design. Labour leader Ivana Bacik said that she wants to “see things moving very fast”. “It has taken too long,” said Bacik, who called for construction to begin by 2030. “There is a very clear outline coming through and things should move on swiftly and we will be pushing government to make sure it does progress at pace.” Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: The 2025 Forbes Entrepreneurial CMO 50
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethmatlins/2025/04/08/the-2025-forbes-entrepreneurial-cmo-50/

BySeth Matlins, Forbes Staff. According to the International Monetary Fund’s World Uncertainty Index, 6 weeks ago, measures of global uncertainty reached their third highest level since monthly tracking began in 2008, behind only that year’s global economic turmoil and the pandemic. And as any behavioral scientist—or anyone with common sense for that matter—knows, uncertainty clouds and complicates decision making processes and thus the path to purchase and is something other than the optimal macro-context for marketing or marketers. But so it is, and so it makes the need for chief marketers to challenge norms, thinking and doing entrepreneurially and differently, ever more important. What then makes for an entrepreneurial CMO? At Forbes, and as we have for the four years since we created this recognition, we consider the entrepreneurial CMO one who approaches driving growth neither beholden to the status quo nor to disrupting it for the sake of same. We believe the entrepreneurial CMO understands both what has enduring value and what needs to change, whether within their organizations and/or in how they go to market. They are strategic risk-takers, learning and optimizing based on both what works and, inevitably, what doesn’t, believing that failures aren’t failures if you learn from and get better because of them. They see opportunity in constraints and are relentlessly focused on making and doing more with less, no matter how much they might have. Their entrepreneurial approach to marketing challenges assumptions and what’s come and been done before. It’s a mindset that informs their strategies, and evidence of it is often seen through tactical application and activation, the in-market expression of mindset and approach. So too do we recognize the difference between being a great CMO and a great and entrepreneurial one. Not everyone is both and not everyone who is, is both at the same time. A great CMO focuses on what matters most, on what creates and captures demand, and on how to best allocate limited resources to unlimited opportunities. They eschew the rest as distraction and think about the business and their role in driving it strategically and then execute creatively. However, we consider this to be as fundamental as it is essential, and not in and of itself evidence of an entrepreneurial approach. We also recognize that the “entrepreneurial” must be considered within the specific context of different industries, categories, companies, and markets. Because that which may be business as usual for company X might be an entirely new way of thinking and doing for company Y, and our judging and selection of the fifty CMOs recognized on this year’s list makes efforts to account for this. It’s our conviction that a status-quo approach to marketing is an increasingly challenged one. It’s our belief that an entrepreneurial take on driving growth and on the art, science, and practice of marketing is and will be increasingly important to great—even good—CMOs, as there is no current reason to think these times of radical uncertainty will become anything but more so in the near-future. As reminder, this particular Forbes list is a one-and-done list, which is to say that once someone has appeared on it, they are no longer eligible for it. This year’s cohort represents the most geographically diverse one yet, and as you read through it (presented alphabetically), you’ll find evidence of an entrepreneurial marketing approach from leaders stewarding brands and companies across categories and the globe. Each is a chief marketer—regardless of their titles—who has been selected from among hundreds of nominees, based on open-nominations, and judged by qualitative consideration from amongst their peers, marketing industry and agency leaders, executive recruiters, CMO list alumni, and Forbes, by whom all final decisions were made. Regardless of what and where they market, it’s how they market and compete that finds them recognized on this 4th annual Forbes Entrepreneurial CMO 50 list. As in year’s past, we think you’ll find something to learn from each and all of those recognized and invite you to get to know them below. 2025 Forbes Entrepreneurial CMO 50 tk Because despite a fundamental, global reset for commercial real estate driven by economic uncertainty, office-norm disruptions, and the continued evolution towards a post-pandemic new normal, Baer’s marketing embraces the disruption that comes from “breaking models.” Knowing that the times and category require reinvention, Baer and her team have reimagined CBRE’s brand and client experience, marketing’s mission, structure, capabilities, and audiences, and, as she told Forbes, “built a level of accountability the business had not previously experienced.” During her tenure as CMO of the world’s largest commercial real estate services firm, Baer and her team have challenged outdated paradigms and models. At a time when businesses and policymakers are reevaluating how cities function, Baer and her team created the firm’s Shaping Tomorrow’s Cities initiative, positioning CBRE as more than a services provider by urging industry leaders to rethink economic, demographic, and infrastructure challenges. “[Marketing] stepped up to be the ultimate convener, giving a voice—and a platform—to these consequential themes,” Baer tells Forbes. Since its launch, this program alone has doubled the firm’s client engagement. In Q4 2024, CBRE’s reported revenues increased 16% year-over-year (YoY). Linda Bethea Because Bethea’s focus on “championing unorthodox ways of doing things” ensures the company’s marketing remains agile and continually “tweaked” based on performance. With the company since 2020, Bethea has found new ways to solve problems and meet unmet consumer needs with what she describes as a “test and learn” approach. To these ends, Bethea and her team work to create a culture of learning and risk-taking, embracing what inevitable failures can teach, “curating a wall of ‘fame & shame’ highlighting both our successes and failures to help our team become more comfortable with risk-taking.” Examples of Bethea’s unorthodox and entrepreneurial approach include launching STōK, a “bold” cold-brew brand—not just in partnership with Wrexham AFC but by “sponsoring a stadium in a country where the product isn’t sold?” As she asked Forbes, “what is bolder than that?” Facing budget declines of 70% for International Delight, a $1B+ portfolio brand, Bethea and her team took an insight—75% of 18-24-year-olds watch at least one hour of reality TV weekly—and created a TikTok reality show, Créme House, to drive engagement and growth. In the last quarter reported, Danone saw an increase in like-for-like sales of 5.8% across its North American market. Benjamin Braun Because Braun markets with the conviction that scale isn’t incompatible with agility and that “even if you work for a massive global conglomerate like Samsung you operate as a start-up team.” With a remit including oversight of the company’s marketing across 44 countries, Braun tells Forbes that you can’t “allow yourself to become complacent and slow. You think big and figure out how to deliver without a budget or people. Change,” he says, “is driven by people with ideas. Not budgets.” For Braun, marketing isn’t just about storytelling—it’s about proving real business results because, and as he says, “only then will we gain credibility.” Illustrations of this and his entrepreneurial approach are seen in the brand’s activation at the Paris Olympics. Rather than spending millions on advertising, Braun and his team went guerrilla—gifting 17,000 Samsung foldable phones to Olympians and Paralympians, requesting only that they unpack them on social media. This led to “Victory Selfies” on Olympic podiums, massive global exposure at a fraction of the cost, and a 23% sales increase. International online research data and analytics firm YouGov recently named Samsung the #1 Best Global Brand for 2025. Heidi Browning Because as sports’ traditional broadcast model evolves to a multi-platform and direct-to-consumer one, Browning markets knowing engaging the next generation of fans requires a transformation in skills and approach. Equating the entrepreneurial mindset driving the league’s marketing to the “cowboy ethos” she learned growing up in Montana, Browning tells Forbes, this cowboy spirit creates the “fearless pursuit of new frontiers, question(ing) everything; both why and why not; and being comfortable with the unknown.” To ensure the NHL’s continued growth, Browning and her team apply the lessons of start-up culture to invite new fans and revenues into the sport and league. Examples include creating the Power Players Youth Advisory Board, embedding Gen Z perspectives directly into marketing decisions to ensure future generation relevance, launching an original content docuseries, “Face-Off: Inside the NHL,” with Amazon Studios among others, and which succeeded in driving both upper and lower funnel growth metrics. The NHL saw record-breaking business performance in 2023-24, with revenue reaching $6.2 billion, a 5.7% year-over-year increase, and total attendance hitting an all-time high of 22.9 million. Jason Bunge Because when Bunge joined the 102-year-old toy category icon as its first CMO in 2023, “there was,” as he told Forbes, “the opportunity and need to build an entirely new marketing organization; construct a new set of marketing capabilities to snap to the company’s evolving business portfolio, and perhaps most importantly, redefine the role of marketing for the different needs of each business.” The former Riot Games CMO and his team approach driving growth recognizing the challenges and opportunities for the company’s principal business lines (toys, physical games and digital/video games) “are bespoke, and the marketing organization must be able to demonstrate agility, efficiency and scale in how it addresses each.” To these ends, Bunge carved out 5% of their budget “for a first-of-its-kind company test-and-learn agenda,” in order “to inject a new mindset of ‘roles of brands’, (because) not everything was going to grow and not everything needed the same type or amount of marketing.” This approach drove insights allowing Bunge and his team to understand where resources would have the greatest impact and return. As Bunge shared, “having an entrepreneurial mindset sometimes means breaking old habits and fighting hard to create space and oxygen for new approaches.” Emma Chalwin Because as she leads all marketing globally for this enterprise software company, Chalwin is intent on driving growth by “breaking the B2B mold.” As Chalwin and her team disrupt Workday’s traditional marketing and ensure it is anything but category-typical, she never loses sight of the fact that, as she told Forbes, “we’re not just selling to a business; we’re selling to the people who work there.” This human-centric approach to enterprise marketing is driven by a mindset rooted in what she describes as rule-breaking, risk-taking and acting like “an entrepreneur inside a Fortune 500 company.” Believing that challenging the status quo of B2B marketing requires a sense of humor and resolve, she and her team launched the Rock Star 2.0 campaign, bringing an “unexpected irreverence” that challenged conceptions about who the rock stars of business are. Chalwin tells Forbes the campaign increased web traffic by over 50% and lead-to-sales conversions by 17%. She’s also working to train 20,000 employees as brand ambassadors to ensure everyone can share a consistent and compelling brand story. Workday’s FY25 revenues increased 16.4% YoY. Kim Chappell Because in order to compete against industry Goliaths, Chappell is helping build this infant formula company into more than just a business and is reshaping conversations and expectations about modern parenting. For Chappell, being an entrepreneurial marketer isn’t just a mindset—it’s a muscle. As she told Forbes, “you have to train yourself to move in the moment without hesitation—with limited resources and often without a blueprint for success. If you don’t go do the work, it’s just another idea, what-if, or magic moment lost.” One example of Chappell’s approach to advancing the conversations driving Bobbie’s growth, is when a Times Square billboard featuring culinary influencer Molly Baz, pregnant, in underwear, and holding lactation cookies over her breasts was removed for violating the billboard owner’s guidelines, Chappell and her team saw opportunity and moved to both seize and make the moment. In only two weeks, Bobbie had Baz back on a Times Square billboard, this time breastfeeding her newborn—a cultural first—and apt illustration of Chappell’s entrepreneurial conviction that “not everything needs a quarter of planning to be on brand, bold and successful.” Chappell tells Forbes that over the past year, Bobbie has become the fastest-growing brand in its category. Daniel Cherry III Because for Cherry, entrepreneurial marketing is about “always being in beta, and instead of fearing failure embracing it as critical feedback pushing ideas one step closer to thrilling the consumer.” As Cherry helped lead the brand through the very public early-end of its controversial partnership with Kanye West his perspective on failure as feedback would make the difference. “We suffered a crisis of confidence and almost believed the hype,” he told Forbes. But rather than replacing the void left by the end of that partnership with another, Cherry thought and did differently, turning to adidas’ greatest asset—its archive—and creating “Originals LA.” Intended as a new business unit not just a marketing approach, Cherry’s idea for moving the business forward looked backwards. By tapping the brand’s archives, Cherry and his team helped put adidas back at the center of sneaker culture, as evidenced by the near ubiquity of Sambas and Gazelles over the past year. Cherry also built forward, championing new collaborations blending nostalgia with modernity, launching initiatives like the adidas Foundation, and restructuring creative workflows to give designers greater autonomy. For the quarter ending December 2024, company revenues had increased nearly 24% YoY. Kristyn Cook Because in the crowded and complex insurance market, Cook leads marketing for this category leader with a conviction that it’s only by “taking the right calculated risks where you have opportunity to win big.” Importantly though, the work Cook leads proves entrepreneurial marketing doesn’t always mean chasing reinvention for reinvention’s sake, Cook and her team are amplifying State Farm’s most powerful assets—its signature red, iconic jingle, and, of course, Jake from State Farm—by positioning them in high-profile, real-world moments that matter. “Our goal is to stay nimble so we can jump in on trending cultural moments,” Cook told Forbes. As examples, the brand has been a first-mover in the category in Gaming, and when Donna Kelce became a cultural focal point, State Farm took advantage of the moment by placing Jake next to her at a game, amplifying brand I.P. and creating a clutter-breaking moment for the brand. A 25-year company veteran, Cook oversees both marketing and sales. And in support of the 18,000 agents in its network, she and her team “always strive to be ‘market movers’ in any space in which we play.” Phil Cook Because during an explosion in interest from fans and partners alike, Cook, the league’s first CMO, is ensuring the WNBA isn’t just riding a wave of growth but actively driving it. Cook and his team are creating a new marketing playbook for the WNBA and its rising stars, during a time of unprecedented attention on women’s basketball. While most leagues pay little attention to their players’ pasts once drafted,Cook and his team took a different strategic approach with their “Welcome to the W” campaign, as college stars including Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Cameron Brink segued from the NCAA to the WNBA. In leading efforts to bridge the players’ college and pro journeys, the campaign leaned heavily into the players’ college pasts, creating a narrative continuity helping grow the league’s fan-base on the players’ existing ones. This, as well as a differentiated commitment to social impact, a heightened focus on dimensionalizing player narratives, and creating a 24/7 content hub for the league amongst other efforts, are driving unprecedented numbers for the WNBA. Last year witnessed the largest rights deal in the league’s history, an aggregated $2.2B across ESPN, Amazon and NBCUniversal; sponsorship revenue and demand exploded, as attendance increased 48% and sellout games 242% YoY. Stefano Curti Because with a determination to “make a large company small again,” Curti is ensuring leaner teams and faster decision-making help transform Coty into a nimbler player across the global beauty category. As the leader of a transformation that’s revitalized brand icons like CoverGirl and Rimmel, Curti’s entrepreneurial approach is rooted in speed and connection. In order to mirror the approach of smaller and niche-beauty players, and nurture the brands’ internal “cool factor,” he and his team created an internal incubator, Agile Beauty, which operates like a startup within Coty. Since its inception, the incubator has developed trend-driven products in just eight months, an industry-best for a global beauty powerhouse. To these same ends, Curti and his team have built new advocacy and community programs, engaging influencers and beauty creators not only to amplify storytelling but to co-develop products. With a remit spanning Europe, North America, and high-growth markets like India, Latin America, and the Middle East, Curti and his team are expanding Coty’s global footprint while leveraging its dominance in prestige fragrance—a category he calls “the skincare of the mind”—to drive future innovation and consumer engagement. Coty reported 10% net revenue growth in 2024, outpacing the 9% global beauty market increase. Carmen DeRosas Because by challenging status quo and conventional industry norms, DeRosas is redefining what marketing is in the UAE’s financial services category, and helping lead the transformation of one of the oldest banking institutions in the country. Since arriving at Rakbank, DeRosas tells Forbes she has “implemented a culture of continuous experimentation…that continues to challenge and improve our models,” evidence of which can be seen in a near 60% reduction in agency costs and 50% increase in asset turnaround times during her tenure. Ensuring that marketing is a driver of the company’s innovation and transformation, has DeRosas and her team embracing a challenger brand ethos and shifting mindsets “from fear to exploration,” which she credits with helping drive “the step change we have created across all marketing disciplines, from transforming the way we show up, reshaping agency partnerships, launching campaigns that have elevated brand perception and performance, to delivering a 4x uplift in digital acquisition.” With industry expertise honed during time at PayPal and American Express, DeRosas’s remit includes overseeing the Rakbank brand, its insurance technology platform Protego, and family finance app Skiply. Since getting to Rakbank, DeRosas and her team have driven a major shift in marketing’s role at the bank—and their enhanced brand focus has contributed to a 13-point increase in employee engagement, reinforcing her belief that a strong, people-first culture is key to sustained innovation and growth. Rakbank had record-breaking financial performance last year, and a 16.4% increase in net profits YoY. Carole Diarra Because the “vision to see beyond traditional strategies and the agility to act on them in ways that drive real impact” is helping Diarra fuel the iconic brand’s transformation from its comfort-first origins to a broader fashion and lifestyle business. With a global remit, Diara and her team are redefining what UGG is, where it shows up, and how it connects with its audience. Under her marketing leadership, they’re doing this by focusing on a combination of “agile media thinking” that is inverting status-quo channel approaches, a media-mix strategy shift to social-first, real-time creative decision making, and liberating their marketing from the category’s traditional seasonal emphasis. An illustration of the latter and Diarra’s enhanced emphasis on consumer-led innovation is the brand’s “UGG Season” platform which, as Diarra shared with Forbes, “didn’t start from us but from our community (including Cardi B)...we didn’t create the movement; we recognized and amplified it, letting culture lead our strategy.” This entrepreneurial approach, one untethered to the past, is also evident in UGG’s unexpected collaborations with Paris Fashion Week, and fashion-forward brands including Sacai and Telfar. A core part of the Deckers’ portfolio, for Q3FY25, the UGG brand reported +16.1% increase in net sales YoY. Cristina Diezhandino Because Diezhandino’s marketing for Diageo’s 200 brands is rooted in a “mindset of possibility” and an approach that she told Forbes, values ”progress over perfection. It’s okay to fail as long as we learn.” Despite category headwinds created by a changing world and consumer attitudes and behaviors, Diezhandino realizes that what doesn’t change is the need to stay “centered around celebrations, culture and memorable moments” and that this in turn requires her marketing organization to “understand—and shape the future of—socializing better than anyone else.” To these ends, Diezhandino and her team have built a marketing organization thriving on “connected decisioning,” curiosity, agility, experimentation, reorganizing marketing into “agile brand communities” which allows them to better turn insight into action. To accelerate the growth of $100+ (USD) brands, Diezhandino created the Diageo Luxury Group, uniting its luxury portfolio. To ensure her organization has the tools to act fast in evolving markets, Diezhandino spearheaded initiatives including a Virtual Studio “revolutionizing how we create content”, a global partnerships lab, and Diageo’s largest consumer data initiative. With responsibility for marketing, innovation and digital transformation for the global portfolio, Diezhandino is thinking and doing differently to ensure Diageo’s place in socializing’s future. Brian Donnelly Because Donnelly understands that “speed is a competitive advantage” and, as he tells Forbes, while “there’s a comfort in the ‘tried and true,’ challenging norms, experimenting fearlessly, and pivoting quickly, allows us to adapt and refine strategies in real-time.” With P&L accountability for the 40-year-old genealogy brand’s global business operations, Donnelly’s remit includes oversight of marketing, growth, and business development across the 130 countries where they do business. Intent on “inspiring a culture of innovation across the business” Donnelly and his team identified a growth opportunity, creating a new market by leveraging their genetic testing expertise and applying it to the pet category for the first time. Focused on driving growth by marketing and raising awareness “of the emotional, cultural and personal benefits that come from discovering your roots,” Donnelly and his team are pushing boundaries and experimenting with the new as they reshape Ancestry’s brand, commerce, and customer engagement. Donnelly reports that brand health metrics are rising and that, in 2024, the company saw double-digit growth in DNA kit sales. As of May 1, Donnelly will become the Chief Commercial Officer at Myriad Genetics. Bené Eaton Because in leading marketing globally for this DTC healthcare brand, Eaton’s entrepreneurial approach balances boldness and precision, and as she told Forbes, “isn’t just about disrupting—but about building something meaningful and enduring.” With a remit spanning 34 countries, Eaton and her team lean into the company’s entrepreneurial DNA to fuel their own. For Eaton, entrepreneurial marketing “isn’t just about growth (but) about redefining how a brand can impact people, culture and the world.” To these ends, and as one example, Eaton and her team led Figs to become Team USA’s official Medical Team Outfitter, creating a global stage and moment celebrating the community in a never-been-done-before way. She says the effort drove “significant incremental revenue...but more than the numbers, this campaign redefined how healthcare professionals are perceived.” The LA fires, which devastated the company’s hometown, provide further illustration as Eaton and her team mobilized to quickly support over 1,500 displaced healthcare professionals. “This wasn’t just a crisis response—but testament to our entrepreneurial mindset: acting with urgency, empathy, and impact to show up for our community in moments that matter most.” Colin Fleming Because with a “stubborn intolerance of mediocrity,” Fleming focuses, as he tells Forbes on “what could be, and refusing to be discouraged by the status quo.” Insistent that “none of the Bs in ‘B2B’ should stand for boring,” Fleming and his team are proving that bold storytelling, culture-shaping campaigns, and a strong point of view will drive growth regardless of sector. With a remit leading ServiceNow’s end-to-end global marketing, planning and operations, Fleming has evolved company strategy from product-led to brand-led. As he and his team seek “exponential thinking and big, bold ideas that break the mold,” they’ve rolled out the company’s most comprehensive global campaign ever, high-profile and perception shifting partnerships, and “Project Marie Kondo,” which led to cutting 50% of their content creation to ensure focus on what “sparks joy” for customers. “This simplification” he told us, “frees our teams to concentrate on impact and alignment rather than volume.” For the 12 months ending as of the date of this writing, Service Now’s market capitalization was up 22%. (Disclosure: One of the editors working on this list owns stock in ServiceNow.) Adrian Fung Because Fung brings a “founder’s mentality” to the iconic ecommerce brand, focusing, as he told Forbes, on “treating every dollar like it’s your own, and finding scrappy ways to leverage existing assets, customers, partners.” For Fung, a global remit for marketing a brand and multi-category business like eBay’s, with some 130 million customers and over 2.1 billion listings, requires an approach he defines as “learning fast rather than failing fast.” And in order to leverage learnings to drive innovation at scale, Fung recognizes the need “to balance speed and agility with the complexity and scale of eBay’s (business). To do this, we identify small but high leverage opportunities that can be quickly tested and iterated upon to optimize impact.” One example: An initially small-scale test with Facebook Marketplace in Germany which enabled buyers to browse eBay listings directly on Marketplace, rolled out internationally. Recognizing “this type of innovation can’t be achieved from marketing alone - and requires an end-to-end approach” finds Fung breaking down silos and challenging how problems are solved across the business. As of this writing, eBay’s stock was up over 58% YoY. Arielle Gross Samuels Because with a global mandate across all marketing and communications, the former Blackstone CMO and 10-year Meta veteran, is looking to help redefine the company’s place in its category and is “building from zero to one.” In a category-atypical approach, Gross Samuels is using what she tells Forbes is “surround-sound, cross-channel storytelling as a strategic commercial lever.” To help lead the brand beyond its venture capital origins to that of a global investment and transformation company, Samuels and her team launched “Venture Beyond”, not just a campaign but an invitation to their ecosystem of founders, entrepreneurs, and business leaders. She credits the launch with “invigorating our ecosystem and expanding what’s possible. “ For the year ahead, among other things, Gross Samuels and her team are focused on “unveiling new strategic brand partnerships with major platforms, revitalizing our social strategy with franchised branded series, and convening first-of-their-kind forums to catalyze our community—all in service to ecosystem transformation.” By ensuring “we play our own game and operate as a category of one,” Gross Samuels and her team are continuing to help redefine what people know of and expect from General Catalyst. Gail Horwood Because Horwood doesn’t see constraint in the pharmaceutical category’s deeply regulated environment but a catalyst for integrating “now and next practices” redefining how the company markets to drive impact. To better connect with their multiple constituencies, Horwood and her team have championed and facilitated the “creative and innovative;” building Novartis’ Innovation and Content Labs, and establishing its Media Center of Excellence, leading them to explore non-traditional category channels and audiences. They’ve turned to gaming as a way to educate healthcare professionals and “set new standards for audience engagement in the pharma industry.” And while in many categories a Super Bowl ad is no proof of the entrepreneurial, in January, Horwood and her team broke company and category conventions with a campaign to raise awareness and drive screenings for breast cancer. The ad’s creative was bold by any measure, especially within the context of pharma, and is a case study proving that any category’s work can be emotionally resonant. As Horwood told Forbes, “we didn’t want to just show up; we wanted people to receive the message and take action.” A subsequent announcement of a broader partnership with the NFL “merges the power of sports, culture, and health advocacy in a way that has never been done before.” As of their Q4 reporting, Novartis’s stock was up over 15% YoY. Charisse Hughes Because Hughes is proving that legacy CPG brands can lead cultural conversations—and drive growth while doing it. Since joining Kellanova (formerly Kellogg Company), Hughes has transformed the company’s marketing approach, leaning into bold, unconventional collaborations and innovations that extend beyond the company’s broad portfolio of household names, including Kellogg’s Pringles, and Cheez-Its, themselves. As Hughes told Forbes, “in an era where traditional marketing strategies aren't enough, we have embraced unconventional, culturally resonant collaborations that push boundaries...(and) elevate our brands beyond transactional products to cultural icons.” To these ends, one example of the work Hughes and her team have done is the collaboration between Crocs and Pringles, which went beyond a mere licensing deal in order to create mutually inspired products for both brands. This included the insta-worthy Pringles-inspired slides and the Crush Boot which sold out in under two hours, driving earned media in publications like GQ, not typically known for paying attention to pantry brands. In August, Mars, Inc. offered to acquire Kellanova for $36 billion. If it closes, this will be the largest CPG deal in over a decade. As of this writing, the company’s stock is up over 51% YoY. Kerttu Inkeroinen Because Inkeroinen leads marketing for this six-year-old UK-based alcohol-free beer brand with a “Break Rules, Honor Traditions” mantra, which she says, “allows us to challenge category norms while respecting beer culture.” Despite having only a fraction of the marketing budget of her multinational competitors, Inkeroinen “approaches every decision with big budget energy,” telling Forbes she “sees opportunities where others see limitations and with the resilience—what we call sisu in Finnish—to push through.” And while some may consider process and entrepreneurial agility to be opposed, Inkeroinen doesn’t considering “a well-structured framework what enables fast, efficient scaling.” To these ends, she and her team introduced a cross-functional “gate process” to ensure rapid execution without quality compromises, and built a proprietary digital platform to, among other things, drive pint giveaways in pubs, an in-house innovation that she credits with “removing cost barriers and unlocking new distribution opportunities.” Inkeroinen leads marketing, communications, innovation, and e-commerce for the brand. Her entrepreneurial approach has helped Lucky Saint become what she says is the most loved and most Googled alcohol-free beer in the U.K. Marissa Jarrett Because for Jarratt “acting like an entrepreneur is a cornerstone of how I lead and inspire my team,” an approach driving how she has built the marketing organization for this global retail giant. Focused on ensuring 7-Eleven doesn’t just keep pace with cultural and consumer shifts but actively drives them while navigating market volatility and new resource constraints, Jarratt emphasizes agility, creativity, and resilience. With broad responsibilities in the U.S. and Canada across marketing, corporate communications, and sustainability, Jarratt and her teams navigated “over 220 reputation-critical issues, implementing a three-tier crisis management strategy,” introduced “Big Bite Hot Dog-Flavored Sparkling Water” on April Fool’s Day to recruit Gen Z customers and publicize the launch of their private label sparkling water brand. The creatively dissonant effort drove a nearly 10% month-over-month increase in store brand sales and a 12% increase across the category; expanded 7-Eleven’s in-house creative agency, producing campaigns faster and cheaper, all while also reducing plastic bag usage by 37%. Jarratt is intent on “steering the brand out of a challenging 2024” and will continue enhancing the retailer’s “ability to adapt and innovate, even in a resource-constrained environment. Nicolas Kettelhake Because in a digital world saturated with “perfect” images, Kettelhake is reinvigorating an 80-year-old analog brand, making what’s old new again by proving that imperfection sells. Kettelhake and his team market by counterprogramming and leaning away from—rather than into—digital cultural trends. Because Polaroid images can’t be retouched, Kettelhake and his team have delivered what he described to Forbes as “a counter to digitized, altered, ‘perfect’ photography, because Polaroid is one of one, and inherently imperfect due to the chemical development process.” Kettelhake ensures the brand’s claim to a positioning rooted in the tactile and imperfect not only drives communication but product innovation. To make a statement against the endlessly replicable nature of digital images, he and his team have elevated the craft of instant photography by appealing to high-end professional photographers, invited digitally-native consumers into the brand by becoming part of sub-cultures, and created a new membership program. By zigging while culture zags, Kettelhake’s integrated, multi-channel and cohort approach has sold-out both new products and film, and driven YoY double digit sell-through increase across the full business. Kettelhake left Polaroid as of April 1st. Drieke Leenknegt Because Leenknegt understands that in the ever-changing consumer landscape, today’s “marketing isn’t about incremental change—it’s about transformation.” Despite its globally iconic brand status, Leenknegt inherited a business facing years of declining revenue and a turnaround imperative. Her entrepreneurial approach to marketing has helped reverse Vans’ decline and position it for long-term growth. Since joining two years ago, Leenknegt has restructured the company’s global marketing team, going beyond necessary surface-level adjustments to deep, strategic reinvention that is connecting dots across marketing, product, and commerce. All of this is driving what she tells Forbes is “agility, alignment, and profitability, ensuring innovation is more than just an idea.” Leenknegt and her team are embracing and deploying an “always on marketing model...that balances reinvention with authenticity.” Illustration is found in their creation and launch of a new pinnacle segment, OTW by Vans, at Paris Fashion Week. Describing this as both a product and cultural innovation, Leenknegt credits the innovation with fueling extraordinary sell-through and, as being but one effort that is helping restore brand momentum. While numbers for the VF Corp-owned brand are off the record, Leenknegt reports a return to growth and that brand and business have turned around. Diego Lomanto Because without the tens of billions of dollars raised by competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic, Lomanto leads marketing for this startup generative AI enterprise solution, certain that “winning in AI isn’t just about who builds the best model, but about who owns the conversation.” Given their relative resource constraints, Lomanto and his team approach owning the conversation by ensuring Writer is, as he told Forbes, “impossible to ignore to the folks we wanted to have a conversation with...that wherever AI decision-makers looked, they saw Writer, setting us apart in a highly competitive, scrutinizing and often hesitant market.” The brand’s outsized presence on stage, in headlines, and on billboards along Silicon Valley’s busiest highways was just one part of its scrappy reach and frequency strategy. Certain that “the entrepreneurial marketer knows the best marketing comes from customers who can’t stop talking about their ROI,” Lomanto created a program targeting analysts, a.k.a. the influencers of the AI category, marketing the brand as an ROI catalyst and movement, turning “our biggest successes—for companies like Salesforce and Uber—into our biggest marketing assets.” At the end of 2024, the company raised an additional $200 million, increasing its valuation to $1.9 billion. Victoria Lozano Because despite Crayola’s dominant market share, Lozano pushes the business to think and market like a challenger, redefining not just what Crayola sells, but repositioning the brand and business by repositioning creativity itself. Lozano and her team have redefined how the company creates commercial value. As Lozano told Forbes, “Crayola is a bigger brand than business,” and in order to capitalize on the former and overcome the latter, she and her team are shifting long-held but limiting parental perceptions about Crayola as just an arts-and-crafts brand by marketing “beyond the crayon,” embedding the brand deeper into family routines and educational systems. To these ends, Lozano launched Campaign for Creativity, an advocacy movement reframing creativity—and Crayola’s role in it—as a critical life skill; and built Crayola Studios, a content development and production division that creates programming across genres for kids and their parents. The studio already has some dozen partnerships, including those with parent company Hallmark, a BBC Kids partnership, and a brand partnership with audiobook platform Audible. Lozano’s entrepreneurial approach is reframing the brand, its scope, and creating new sources of revenue. Martina Luger Because as Luger leads marketing for this, U.K. based hospitality enterprise, she’s rejecting the category’s traditional price-based segmentation, and instead deploying a narrative-driven model to position and differentiate the company’s brands. With a portfolio including The Mondrian, Hoxton and SLS brands, Luger and her team focus on disruptive lifestyle strategies rooted in her conviction that safe ground never leads to innovation. As she told Forbes, the entrepreneurial marketer has to have “the courage to stand on the edge of a cliff because only at the edge do you get the most amazing views.” Luger and her team are “making the statement that our hotels are more than just transactional decisions,” an approach further illustrated by Ennismore’s “game-changing” loyalty program, “Dis-loyalty.” Luger shared that while “traditional loyalty models reward people for sticking to the familiar—we wanted to flip that idea on its head,” and with no points, tiers, or blackout dates, members get 20% off first-time stays, and 10% off return visits, part of what’s driving growth across her global remit for marketing 17 brands, and over 170 hotels in more than 35 countries with another 120+ in the pipeline. Astha Malik Because certain “there has never been a better time to be a better marketer,” Malik is unconstrained by the tried and true and untethered to industry standards and expectations. With a broad remit across this SaaS platform’s corporate strategy, global expansion, and growth initiatives redefining how brands connect with their audiences—and how Braze connects with its, Malik encourages innovation, as she told Forbes, by ensuring her teams are “comfortable with failure—because it’s not final.” Malik and her team created the company’s Innovation Lab, 427°, a consulting initiative providing clients agency like services during and post-sales in order to help them rethink customer connections at scale to provide clients, because Malik believes “the best marketing doesn’t just drive pipeline, it builds enduring and valuable relationships. The Lab, but one illustration of her entrepreneurial approach in action, has “accelerated sales cycles, improved satisfaction, and set us apart.” Malik remains intent on challenging assumptions about the CMO role, ensuring marketing always has a seat at the Board table, and “challenging everyday actions and standing out when others may prefer to just fit in.” For Q4 25, the company reported YoY revenue growth of 22%. Devika Mathrani Because in an increasingly competitive healthcare landscape, Mathrani is “shaping the future of health care and changing the conversation in the category” for one of the nation’s top 10 healthcare systems, by bringing unconventional strategies to a category not known for same. Mathrani and her team are challenged not just by their competitive set but also a glut of healthcare disinformation. When “alongside the rise of (public health) misinformation, we recognized the need to inform and empower consumers”, as Mathrani told Forbes, they launched a newsroom operation to “publish trusted information—helping people navigate their health proactively and reactively.” When New York City faced a critical blood-supply shortage, Mathrani and her team drove essential donations by turning donations into a limited-edition product drop, applying a scarcity marketing model common in footwear but not in healthcare. Partnering with renowned pastry chef Dominique Ansel, creator of the Cronut, donating blood became the only way to get Ansel’s “3 Lives Bar.” Thinking and acting outside category norms led to a 25,000 percent (not a typo) increase in traffic to the donation site, and a 40% increase in donations. Stephanie McCarty Because McCarty is challenging home-building category norms, transforming a traditionally rigid and slow-moving process in order to fundamentally reshape how buyers navigate one of the most significant purchases of their lives. With oversight of marketing for one of the nation’s largest homebuilders, McCarty told Forbes she is intent “not just on adapting to change but driving it, ensuring our marketing plays a critical role in our growth and shaping the future of the industry.” McCarty and her team have led the company to create a fully-digital shopping experience, an “unheard of” first for the homebuilding category. As she told Forbes, this consumer-centric innovation drove meaningfully higher conversion rates, exponentially reduced cancellations, and increased revenue. McCarty, whose remit includes overseeing marketing and consumer engagement across 21 markets, has also redefined how homebuilders connect with consumers, turning social media from a branding tool into a direct revenue driver, another category first. Despite an environment marked by significantly higher interest rates, as of this writing, the company’s stock was up over 7% YoY. Sarah Moore Because as Moore leads marketing for the culturally iconic restaurant chain, she does so with the conviction that entrepreneurial marketing “is not just the high-stakes journey of a disruptive startup—but about leading transformation when the odds are against you—when competition is fierce, behaviors are shifting, and a brand must evolve or fade.” With oversight of all marketing for the chain’s 660+ locations, including brand, culinary menu architecture, and pricing strategy, Moore and her team are driven by “bucking category norms...and the relentless pursuit of discomfort.” As rising egg prices became their own source of discomfort for customers nationally, Moore told Forbes that she and her team flipped the competitive script and, “instead of raising prices (like competitors), we launched a rewards promotion where members earned extra for egg-based dishes.” She credits the simple and counter-intuitive move with driving higher guest frequency and spend and adding 6 million new loyalty program members in just year one. Modernizing a brand that is literally rooted in the “old” is no small challenge. But Moore’s take on being an entrepreneurial CMO “isn’t just about building something new. It’s also about reinventing, reimaging, and revitalizing something that already exists.” Michael Moses Because in a landscape where “all the content in the world is the push of a button away,” Moses markets acutely aware that “launching every film is akin to launching a new business...every few weeks.” Over the past year ,Moses, who has been with Universal for 25 years, seven as global CMO, oversaw marketing for a portfolio including Wicked and The Fall Guy, and as he told Forbes, always with a “healthily skeptical eye on data because its proliferation is an alluring siren call that risks narrowcasting the audience and making all our approaches homogenized.” For “Twisters”, overcoming this siren call meant tapping into an overlooked Heartland audience through country music partnerships and broadening the film’s appeal without alienating traditional moviegoers. For “The Wild Robot”, Moses and his team took a slow-burn strategy—festival screenings, a dialogue-free trailer—helping make it 2024’s top original animated title and making “Wicked” a ubiquitous cultural presence. In 2024, Universal led the domestic box office, surpassing $1.9 billion in ticket sales and securing four of the year’s top 10 highest-grossing films. Nicole Parlapiano Because in leading marketing globally for this FOX owned ad-supported streamer, Parlapiano is “stripping fear from the equation and leaning into risk (to) drive business growth.” As Parlapiano sees it, marketing today requires not just doing differently but thinking dangerously. With this in mind, as she told Forbes, she looks to identify “marketers who have dangerous ideas,” and that while she has “done work that could fail, it’s better to throw your hat in the ring than to wait for perfection.” Along with a broad remit to grow Tubi’s brand and audience, Parlapiano works closely with the streamer’s B2B team in order to demonstrate how valuable Tubi’s viewers are to advertisers. To these ends, her creatively dissonant “Tubi Is More Popular Than” campaign did just this, reframing both brand and business. Also, Parlapiano and her team launched Stubios, a “first-to-market product” for aspiring filmmakers and their fans, that gives the camera to “anyone who has a story and puts the power to greenlight in the hands of the viewer.” The first class of Stubio projects goes live later this year. Over the past year, Tubi has seen monthly-average-user growth of 23% YoY. Lynn Pina Because Pina drives marketing for this travel medical insurance brand with what she describes as an “owner’s mindset.” As she told Forbes, “when you see yourself as an employee only, you can be passive, complacent, and easily defeated. With an owner’s mindset, I’m relentless about finding solutions and creative approaches to achieve the desired outcome.” For Pina, whose remit includes Marketing, Product and Customer Experience, driving growth with entrepreneurial marketing approach is about “striking the right balance between building and breaking,” a perspective that has served Pina and the company well, in the highly regulated category, and over the past year in particular. In just six months—rather than the usual 18-24—Pina and her team led the creation and launch of a new product and partnership, Globaline, which significantly expanded the GeoBlue’s portfolio and market reach. Doing so required Pina and her team to challenge assumptions, break down barriers, and build from scratch, all while working across two companies with two different cultures and competing priorities. Pina reports that the product launch reached 80% of its first-year goal within just six months. Surhabi Pokhyrial Because as digital has become 70% of the 186-year-old CPG company’s media mix, Pokhriyal works to “scale fast and scrap fast” in a landscape where “many new shiny things come and fizzle often.” For brands including household names like Arm & Hammer, Trojan and Waterpic, Pokhriyal tells Forbes that, over the past year, she and her teams have “started using social as the ‘third shelf’ and have partnered with some 4000 influencers in order to create “a virtuous cycle for social engagement drives online and in-store sales.” This, along with ensuring “’no-dead-end media’ and that over 90% of our media is shoppable, is how our teams truly scale fast and scrap fast when needed.” Knowing that today’s status quo can be disrupted in an instant, she and her team “keep raising the bar with readiness not just for the here and now, but for tomorrow.” Pokhriyal credits this approach—and a “healthy sense of paranoia”—with helping “drive outsized eCommerce growth versus CPG peers.” In the last year, Church & Dwight’s revenue growth surpassed its outlook and, according to sources, outperformed its competitors. Amanda Rubin Because since joining the world’s most profitable hedge-fund, Rubin is redefining what marketing means and does in a firm and industry that has long operated behind closed doors. As Rubin told Forbes, entrepreneurial marketing “requires not only showing others what needs to be done, but more importantly, what else is possible even when it deviates from the status quo.” Until Rubin, Citadel’s marketing status quo relied largely on earned media-driven awareness of the firm’s financial acumen, with little time given to its brand or that of its founder, Ken Griffin’s. Facing “a fierce war for talent and very public scrutiny”, Rubin built Citadel’s marketing function from the ground up to better position the company—and Griffin’s philanthropic efforts—among what she describes as a “complex ecosystem of audiences, from talent to commercial clients, regulators and policy-makers...none of their journeys are linear, and their perceptions have enduring impact on our commercial success.” By actively building a marketing narrative, making visible what had historically been opaque, and deploying a multi-faceted content strategy across dozens of new touchpoints and channels, Rubin and her team have helped drive a 50% YoY increase in talent applications, while concurrently tripling awareness of Griffin’s philanthropic initiatives. 1x1_John Schoolcraft Because Schoolcraft conceived and built a new-model approach to creating a category and driving growth for this oat-milk brand and company. Schoolcraft takes pains to make clear he is not a CMO and that Oatly doesn’t have a marketing department “at all” but a creative one, something he made a stipulation for joining the company in 2012. As he told Forbes, he believes “marketing departments are filters, and it is always better to work with makers and problem solvers and not approvers.” This perspective led Schoolcraft to build the “Oatly Department of Mind Control” (ODMC), which he describes as a team of creative problem solvers,” instead of a traditional marketing organization. “The ODMC doesn’t solve isolated marketing or brand problems, we understand everything is tied together, so look to solve business problems...(sitting) in on meetings from innovation to finance gives the creative department ownership and understanding of the business, which turns all of us into entrepreneurs.” While one might argue with his definitions, Schoolcraft’s approach is working. Despite slowing growth in the plant-based food category globally, 12+ years in, Oatly continues seeing double-digit sales increases YoY. Alex Schultz Because with an unusually broad remit for a CMO, including global oversight of all analytics and business, public affairs, brand and direct response consumer marketing across Meta and its brand portfolio, the analytically-driven Schultz marries the quantitative and qualitative helping disrupt and reinvent how the company drives business outcomes. While WhatsApp is dominant outside the U.S., in the U.S., it remains a challenger brand. Recognizing that the biggest brand-unlock for the messaging app would be product—not marketing—driven initially, Schultz and his team “deployed product changes to make sharing to WhatsApp easier” before launching the brand’s largest US campaign to date. This effort, “direct response ads using our platforms and others...(which) bent the curve on topline growth.” Identifying an internal lag-time stifling growth of the company’s burgeoning live-shopping ad business, where customers wanted to boost ad-spends but the internal ad-review period “meant the live video would be over by the time we approved the ads,” Schultz and his team brought the idea and insight needed to help the product team reimagine the review process, and leading to what he tells Forbes is “explosive growth of live shopping with business messaging.” At the end of 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 21.94% YoY. (Disclosure: One of the editors working on this list owns stock in Meta.) Geoff Seeley Because as PayPal’s business evolves, Seeley is helping drive “a new approach to product-led marketing that spins our consumer and merchant flywheel even faster.” Seeley’s role as marketing leader is to help conceive and realize new product innovation, and take these products to market across their 450 million customers, 35 million merchants, 200 markets, B2B and B2C, and family of brands, including its eponymous one, Venmo and Honey, In his first year since joining as Global CMO, Seeley drove what he describes as “one of the most significant strategic and executional transformations in our history.” Focused on, as he told Forbes, “revolutionizing global commerce again” Seeley and his team are “working back from (our) customers to create the next innovations.” Evidence of this and Seeley’s intent to catalyze growth by changing how people think about and use the company’s products is seen in the launch of PayPal’s largest-ever program, “Everywhere,” and its partnership with, among others, Apple Wallet, and in how he and his team are capitalizing on Venmo’s becoming a verb, and “subvert(ing) that soundbite to introduce people to a much wider world of Venmo.” As of this writing, the company’s stock is up more than 18% YoY. Peter Semple Because Semple “thinks of our brand, our experience and our proposition as ‘Always WIP’...obsessing about the context in which we operate and reflecting on how we might react. Our conviction to act is the entrepreneurial mindset in action.” With a remit for the Etsy-owned marketplace that includes oversight for brand marketing and communications, merchandising, media, seller growth, and an in-house creative studio, Semple tells Forbes he is “consistently iterating on the brand we present to the world, and the combination of channels and messages we leverage to bring that brand into peoples’ lives.” Focused on audience expansion, brand differentiation, and market share growth in the U.S. and Australia, Semple and his team are unafraid to broaden the brand’s platform and appeal beyond their traditional core demographic. Illustrations of their entrepreneurial approach in action includes expanding Depop’s advocacy programs across 100 U.S. college campuses, cultivating a new generation of engaged brand ambassadors and, also in the US, removing seller fees in order to further differentiate the brand and business, lowering barriers to entry, and leading to material YoY market share growth. In March, Semple was named interim CEO of the company. Jinal Shah Because Shah is driving growth for the buy-now-pay-later platform, by “challenging assumptions, moving with urgency, and transforming constraints into advantages.” Having led the company through multiple strategic evolutions since joining in 2021, Shah and her team are now stewarding Zip through what she describes as its hyper-growth phase with a certainty that “opportunity is created, not waited for.” Focused on “rewriting how people experience financial empowerment,” in the crowded and regulated industry, Shah and her organization are “embedding payment flexibility into everyday passions” including NASCAR, MLB, and concerts. To decrease the brand’s reliance on search networks Shah and her team built Commerce Media, a proprietary and brand-direct model, turning a profitability experiment into a fully independent business unit. Shah has also reframed customer experience, typically an “afterthought in fintech” into a competitive differentiator and, as she told us, “from an operations cost center to a brand accelerator.” Recognizing that “entrepreneurship is about building teams that can scale the mission,” in the past year, she and her teams helped Zip realize a 45% revenue increase YoY. Charlie Smith Because Smith is “pushing the boundaries of luxury fashion communication and perhaps even brand communication in general” for the LVMH-owned brand. In a category long reliant on exclusivity, polish, and reverence, Smith and his team are rewriting the rules—and the brand’s renown—by taking LOEWE in an unexpected and different direction, one where irreverence, lo-fi aesthetics, and surprising collaborations challenge convention, and transcending category constructs. For Smith and his team, challenging the status quo is rooted in what he told Forbes is their “collective willingness to embrace failure enabling us to push boundaries.” Over the past year, Smith’s How to Pronounce LOEWE campaign “tackled head-on that many don’t know how to pronounce our name, something other brands might have shied away from.” He and his team turned a might-have-been-traditional celebrity campaign with Daniel Craig into subversive storytelling, creating “a fresh context and a lot of conversation.” Similarly, LOEWE’s Suna Fujita collaboration reimagined the Japanese ceramist duo’s whimsical figures as an animated universe, pop-ups, and a children’s book, blending artistry with commerce in an entirely new way. Despite a challenging period for many luxury labels, in October, reports indicated LOEWE’s sales had increased 27.5% YoY. In March, long-time Creative Director Jonathan Anderson left the label, and Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez were appointed. John Solomon Because as Solomon leads global marketing for this wellness pioneer, “the biggest breakthroughs haven’t come from rigid planning; they’ve emerged from a willingness to seize unplanned, unbudgeted opportunities driving real consumer connection.” The private-equity backed company is expanding into new verticals, markets, and audiences, without a commensurate expansion in marketing resources, but for Solomon and his team, “with no roadmap and limited resources”, as he told Forbes, “proved that speed and ingenuity can outpace size and budget constraints.” By leaning into other brands’ reach to supplement their own, Solomon and his team forged relationships with Sephora, developing a co-brand product leading to a 50% increase in the vertical YoY; with United Airlines to drive trial in their lounges; and when faced with the challenge of excess inventory, partnered with Hollywood and sports powerhouse CAA, to “turn a potential problem into an opportunity,” executing Name, Image and Likeness deals with tier 1 college football programs, “to ensure Therabody was in the hands of the next generation of elite athletes—who eagerly shared their experience on social media.” Despite their flat marketing budget, Solomon reports their core wellness category grew 40% YoY. Marc Speichert Because Speichert, the first to have this title and combination of B2B and B2C responsibilities in the iconic brand’s corporate history, is reimagining where the brand plays and how commercial returns are driven. Recognizing that organizational structure either facilitates or limits growth, over the past year, Speichert has integrated teams once operating separately, telling Forbes he has optimized “end-to-end strategy and execution,” reimagining corporate structure with “mirror organizations...embedding subject matter experts within regions, allowing them to drive local agendas with autonomy, agility, and greater self-sufficiency.” Long synonymous with hotel luxury, for Speichert and his team, driving growth and innovating at scale, has led them to take the brand into new businesses and categories. This includes launching the first branded Yacht voyage in January, which he describes as “creating something entirely new that challenges industry norms.” At the same time, the brand’s ongoing relationship with HBO’s The White Lotus, was credited by Wallpaper as “achieving something few luxury brands manage: catapulting into mainstream awareness while maintaining exclusivity.” Speichert tells Forbes that these efforts and others are not only identifying and commercializing untapped “white space” but also leading the privately-owned company to record-breaking performance. Kate Trumbull Because, over the past year, in a category challenged by macro-economics and constrained consumer spending, Trumbull markets the iconic QSR brand determined to “get speeding tickets, not parking tickets,” as she told Forbes. Trumbull leads marketing for the brand and its 20,000 franchisees with an action-first approach believing “people will like you for what you say, but they’ll love you for what you do.” For Trumbull and her team, brand actions are redefining “value-driven initiatives beyond price (to) break through the sea of the same offers” that have historically driven the category by “turning consumer value into talk value.” Efforts have included countering shrinkflation with MOREflation, reimagining a traditional buy-one-get-one offer as a brand equity moment with their Emergency Pizza 2.0 campaign, and turning a basic $3 coupon on its head with their You Tip, We Tip driver-appreciation effort. With oversight of Domino’s marketing, product innovation, strategic partnerships and national sales, in over 90 global markets, and despite economic headwinds, Domino’s has posted three consecutive quarters of U.S. same-store sales and order growth. As of this writing, the company’s stock is up over 6% YoY. Sumit Virmani Because as he leads global marketing for the India-based IT services company, Virmani “values the entrepreneurial attitude over mere skills, celebrating risk-taking, experimentation and recognizing excellence through failures that teach, not just successes.” Despite competing against global companies that are better resourced and funded, it’s this approach to marketing that is driving how Virmani and his team create differentiated and deeper connections to the brand as a short-term and long-term growth lever. Evidence of the approach in action includes Infosys’s move into sonic branding, a strategy more typical for B2C marketers than B2B, where brand identity is typically limited to the visual. Certain that “B2B clients (also) value an emotive connection and there’s no reason for B2B to appeal only to the visual sense,” Virmani and his team launched of The Sound of Opportunity—a sonic signature, which was played more than 5 million times in its first six months. As AI continues shaping and reshaping the marketing landscape, Virmani is determined to ensure Infosys helps lead the way for its clients and prospective ones by investing “deeply” in its brand. Over the past five years, and according to Brand Finance, Infosys’s brand value has increased by 15% YoY, and the fastest-growing IT Services brand over the last 5 years. Marc Weinstock Because Weinstock markets the studio’s slate of films understanding that in today’s rapidly changing content landscape a “think-different mindset is crucial. If you can’t think outside the box and blaze a new trail, you’ll simply fall flat.” Over the past year, and for films and sequels including “Sonic the Hedgehog 3”, “A Quiet Place: Day One”, and “Gladiator 2”, Weinstock and his team were responsible not just for “creating or recreating a brand from the ground up nearly every four weeks” as he told Forbes but, more relevantly, for leading the studio to five #1 domestic openings and three franchise-best sequel performances, despite sequels typically underperforming the originals. For Weinstock, success requires not just overcoming competition—but inertia and staying home—and makes marketing innovation mission critical, leading Weinstock and his team to work “with key platforms in ways no one’s ever done.” Examples include partnering with Snapchat to “reach every one of their users at once,” and a “Mission Impossible” interstitial starring Tom Cruise in this year’s Super Bowl. In the midst of the parent company’s reorganizations and sale process, in 2024, Paramount’s filmed entertainment division revenues increased 67% YoY. Kate Wik Because when a brand is as defined in the public consciousness as Las Vegas, expanding perceptions required Wik to reinvent the traditional destination marketing playbook. With a remit to market and sell Vegas globally and, as Wik told Forbes, “in an increasingly noisy world, with an abundance of competition in every category” breaking through requires thinking entrepreneurially. To these ends, Wik and her team expanded on the city’s entertainment roots by focusing on two marquee events, Super Bowl LVIII and Formula 1. But, shifting perceptions for one of the most “branded” cities in the world, required going beyond “sponsorship” and doing things differently. Wik “challenged my teams and my partnerships with the NFL and Formula 1 to leverage their spotlights as a year-round marketing platform.” By thinking beyond the traditional window, she and her team helped reset the rules of destination marketing. “My product is Las Vegas,” Wik told Forbes, and the results of her repositioning it as “The Sports and Entertainment Capital of the World” are measured in broadened perceptions of a brand historically linked to “What Happens Here Stays Here,” and in billions of dollars in direct revenues. Edoardo Zegna Because in a marketing landscape evolving at warp speed, this fourth-generation leader of the Italian brand’s founding family says, “my goal is to make Zegna the slowest company in the world.” Zegna’s approach to driving the business is instead rooted in his belief that, as he told Forbes, “to build a product that lasts forever, you have to be slow; patience and time are indispensable ingredients to create a timeless brand.” This perspective finds the brand’s marketing not disrupting category convention so much as ignoring it. Describing his role at the 115-year-old company, not by his multi-hyphenate remit but as “the custodian of Zegna feelings”, he and his team see their work as he told another publication about creating “unscalable ideas and then figuring out a way to scale them.” All but singularly focused on giving space—often literal—to stories and the emotions they engender, Zegna and his team launched, among other platforms, Villa Zegna, a private-club pop-up bringing the brand’s heritage to life in key markets globally; turned a children’s book about the company’s origins into a week-long immersive experience in Milan, the first Zenga event with no clothes in it; and are creating Oasi Zegna (a Zegna Oasis) destinations around the world, as places to be slow and as metaphor for ZEGNA’s commitment to sustainability, craftsmanship, and lasting impact.

Title: Meta faces antitrust trial that could force it to break off Instagram, WhatsApp

Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, "expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats." Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. “Unable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company’s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,” the FTC says. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. “The FTC already has the difficult task, whether it’s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we’re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,” said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. “And I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.” Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC’s lawsuit “defies reality.” “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI," the company said in a statement. In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC “must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past." This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. Boasberg “seems to be skeptical” of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a “fact question," which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram. “Instagram is now Meta’s biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company’s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,” said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. “The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn’t where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.” But Meta isn't the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google's case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August. “A big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it’s an open question whether the judgment developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing — these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,” Swanson said. “And this will be a case that speaks directly to that.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Intel Stock At $20: A Tempting Tech Bet?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BARCELONA, SPAIN - MARCH 06: A logo sits illuminated at the Intel booth at Mobile Congress 2025 on ... More March 06, 2025 in Barcelona, Spain. (Photo by Eric Alonso/Getty Images) Intel stock (NASDAQ: INTC) has reached a critical support level that has held historical significance. This price range saw nearly ten years of consolidation from 2004 to 2014 before the stock began trending higher, indicating strong buying interest around current levels. This support seems solid, as shown by the stock’s ability to hold up following a sharp 30%+ decline in August 2024. While the length of this consolidation is unknown, Intel at $20 presents a compelling value case, though investors should remain mindful of associated risks. For those seeking gains with lower volatility than individual stocks, check out the High-Quality portfolio, which has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 with over 91% returns since inception. INTC Stock Price History Intel’s current valuation reflects its recent performance struggles. The company is facing negative revenue growth, while competitors AMD, QCOM, and NVDA are enjoying double-digit increases. With negative earnings, Intel trades at a Price to Sales ratio of just 1.8, versus 6.5 for AMD, 4.2 for QCOM, and 20.3 for Nvidia. This may make Intel more appealing as a long-term value play than a short-term growth bet. There are several potential catalysts that could unlock value for Intel: The biggest risk for investors buying at these levels is the potential for capital to be locked up if the stock remains in consolidation for an extended period. It may take time for catalysts to have an effect, requiring patience for meaningful returns. Not keen on the volatility of INTC? The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks tend to deliver higher returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark, offering a smoother ride. Explore HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Former Siena Heights University CFO says she was fired for finding fraud: Trial Balance

Let CFO.com's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Debi Andrews claims she was fired for enforcing financial controls and advising an administrator to file an alleged sexual harassment claim against the college’s president. The Trial Balance is CFO.com’s weekly preview of stories, stats and events to help you prepare. Debi Andrews, the former CFO of Siena Heights University, a small Catholic college in Adrian, Michigan, claims she was fired for refusing to lie to the school’s board of directors about budget irregularities and for allegedly advising a colleague to file a sex discrimination complaint against university president Douglas Palmer. According to the complaint, “had Andrews not opposed Defendants’ fraud and encouraged her coworkers to complain about [Palmer’s] discriminatory behavior, she would not have been terminated.” The university said it is taking the allegations seriously but told MLive it cannot discuss pending litigation or personnel matters. It said it believes personnel decisions were made after “a thorough and careful review of the situation.” Andrews, who took the position in February 2024, reported that athletic coaches were making improper check requests from "fundraising accounts.” She also said expenses were improperly labeled as student-related when money was being spent for personal use. In the summer of that same year, just months into her role, Andrews opposed Palmer’s proposed budget because she claimed it was “not based on sound accounting.” She said she refused to lie to the board of directors about “what the university had done in order to secure the funding.” Days later, according to the complaint, she was placed on unpaid leave. The case also details how Andrews and Palmer’s working relationship deteriorated after she advised a female administrator to file a sexual harassment complaint against Palmer. The unnamed employee’s working relationship with Palmer allegedly changed after the administrator refused to join him at a local bar. Though it isn’t clear how Andrews believes Palmer found out about the advice she gave to another employee, she links this as the second of two causes that ultimately led to her dismissal. Andrews’ lawsuit also names the university’s former director of human resources Fran Johnson, saying she told others that Andrews was having inappropriate relationships with university staff in campus facilities. These allegations were used, according to the lawsuit, as the basis for a “retaliatory and unfounded investigation” launched after Andrews was placed on unpaid leave. In an interview with MLive, Johnson denied all allegations against her. Siena Heights University’s financial impact is felt far beyond the university’s campus. The college is owned by the Adrian Dominican Sisters, who have notably led multiple shareholder activism campaigns at companies like Dicks Sporting Goods, Smith and Wesson and American Outdoor Brands Corporation. Their efforts, which have been supported by major investors like BlackRock, have led to changes around corporate responsibility, particularly around firearms.

Title: Ethereum vs. Ripple: Will XRP overtake ETH in the next 3 years?

Institutional participants show mixed signals as ETH struggles. As Ethereum [ETH] faces mounting pressure, ETF outflows have surged 39% in just one week, signaling shaken investor sentiment. Yet, in a show of confidence, BlackRock has doubled with a massive $1.8 billion ETH position, reinforcing institutional faith in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Just as the dust settles, Standard Chartered has stirred the pot, forecasting that Ripple [XRP] could overtake Ethereum within the next three years. With market dynamics shifting, the race for crypto’s second spot is entering what looks like a high-stakes war zone. Ethereum ETFs recorded weekly net outflows of $82.47 million – marking the largest drawdown in recent months. The chart reveals a clear trend: consistent outflows since mid-February, aligning with Ethereum’s price drop to $1.5K. Source: SoSoValue Total net assets have also steadily declined, now at $5.24 billion, down from a peak above $12 billion in late 2024. This suggests waning short-term investor confidence, even as macro conviction remains strong – evidenced by large institutions like BlackRock increasing exposure. The disconnect hints at a pivotal moment for Ethereum’s market narrative. Despite mounting ETF outflows, BlackRock has solidified its conviction in Ethereum with a $1.8 billion ETH position. The portfolio shows steady accumulation through 2024, signaling a long-term belief in Ethereum’s value proposition. However, a surprising twist enters the frame: Standard Chartered’s latest report forecasts XRP overtaking Ethereum in market cap by 2028. Geoffrey Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets Research, sees XRP rising to become the second-largest non-stablecoin asset, setting up a high-stakes rivalry. The result is a fascinating divergence in institutional outlooks — one doubling down on ETH, the other betting big on XRP. The mixed signals reveal just how uncertain and dynamic the road ahead for crypto’s top contenders truly is. Ethereum’s price hit $1,603 at press time, following a 2.47% daily drop. The broader trend since early 2025 has been decisively bearish, with ETH shedding significant value from above $3,000 levels earlier in the year. The RSI hovered near 39, indicating oversold territory but not yet signaling a strong reversal. Meanwhile, the MACD line sat just below the signal line, suggesting ongoing bearish momentum — although the gap is narrowing, hinting at potential bullish divergence. Source: TradingView Despite BlackRock’s conviction, technicals suggest ETH is still struggling to find solid footing. Any short-term relief rally could face resistance near the $1,800 zone, while a drop below $1,550 could intensify selling pressure.

Title: Topgolf Founders Raise $34 Million For Poolhouse, Their Latest Sports Startup

ByTim Casey ByTim Casey, Senior Contributor. FILE - David Blitzer participates in a New Jersey Devils press conference Thursday, Aug. 15, 2013, ... More in Newark, N.J. Major League Baseball has approved the sale of a minority stake in the Cleveland Guardians to David Blitzer, who also has ownership shares in the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and the NHL’s New Jersey Devils, two people familiar with the deal told the Associated Press on Thursday, June 16, 2022. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File) Poolhouse, a United Kingdom-based startup founded by the brothers behind Topgolf, has raised $34 million in a seed round. The company plans on using the proceeds to further develop its technology, gain a foothold in the competitive sports-themed entertainment retail industry and open locations where people can play a high-tech version of pool while eating, drinking and socializing. The seed round was co-led by Sharp Alpha, a venture capital firm based in New York, and dmg ventures, the venture capital arm of DMGT, which owns the Daily Mail newspaper among other holdings. David Blitzer, who owns a stake in the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils and invests in sports-focused startups, participated in the round, as did investment firms Simon Sports and Active Partners. Poolhouse declined to disclose the valuation of the company following the seed round, some of which it raised via a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) note that will convert to equity when the company raises a planned Series A next year. Poolhouse is the brainchild of twins Dave and Steve Jolliffe, who in 2000 started Topgolf to enhance the experience of going to a golf driving range. Topgolf merged in 2021 with Callaway in a deal that valued Topgolf at $2.1 billion. There are now 96 Topgolf locations in the U.S. and 12 locations in other countries. The Jolliffe brothers also founded Puttshack, a miniature golf entertainment concept that raised $150 million in October 2022 from Blackrock. There are 16 Puttshack locations in the U.S. and four in the United Kingdom. Poolhouse plans on opening its first venue early next year in London. The 21,348-square-foot, two-story building is located next to the city’s Liverpool Street Station and will house 20 pool tables with food and beverage options. The Poolhouse venues will have regular sized pool tables and pool cues, but the company has developed technology that will enhance the experience, including superimposing images on the table, creating various games people can play and allowing them to track their progress on an app and video screens. The company also has a system that can track how good players are and a handicapping system similar to golf that makes it more competitive among players who have various abilities. Andrew O’Brien, a former Credit Suisse banker who invested in Puttshack and sits on the board of F1 Arcade, is Poolhouse’s CEO and runs its day-to-day operations. Steve Jolliffe is Poolhouse’s executive chairman and speaks with O’Brien every day. The Jolliffes remain the largest individual shareholders in Poolhouse, according to O’Brien. “The look and the feel will be important, but ultimately, it’s what the Jolliffes did with Topgolf,” O’Brien said. “They create amazing technology to transform an existing sport. There's a reason why there weren't any Topgolf rivals for 20 years. It’s because they're very strong on the patent side of things. They don't just design pretty. They design things that are difficult to replicate.” O’Brien added: “With Poolhouse, I think they’ve done something very similar. They've created something on the back of technology, which is real pool tables, real pool balls, real cues. Everything's the same, but they've infused technology into it to augment the experience.” After launching in London, Poolhouse plans on opening two sites in the U.S., one in late 2026 and another in early 2027. The company plans on opening four to five locations per year in the U.S. starting in 2027 in downtown locations of major cities such as Boston, Chicago, Nashville, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. Poolhouse will lease space in buildings rather than own the buildings. Poolhouse has also struck a franchising agreement in Australia with Signature Hospitality Group, which has an equity stake in Poolhouse. Poolhouse expects to sign additional franchising or joint venture agreements in other countries. In addition, the company plans on licensing its technology to traditional pool halls, casinos, restaurants, apartment complexes and even homes or anywhere else that has a pool table. “We think there’s huge scope for this to be scaled across the world at quite a pace,” O’Brien said. Lloyd Danzig, managing partner of Sharp Alpha, said the venture capital firm spent 12 to 18 months evaluating companies in what he refers to as the “competitive socialization” or “eatertainment” industry, referring to Topgolf, Puttshack, F1 Arcade and other companies where people gather to socialize, eat, drink and compete in an activity. Sharp Alpha was looking for companies that had high food and drink spend at its venues, were conducive to corporate events, featured activities that could be done on a regular basis rather than a one-off basis and had proprietary software that could be licensed to a third parties at a high margin. He said he believes Poolhouse will meet all of those criteria. “They, more than any other concept we’ve come across, really embody all four of those features,” Danzig said. “The confluence of what we’re bullish on at the category level and also at the concept level and what they’re building dovetailed with just an absolutely incredible management and executive team. We give these guys an 11 out of 10 on founder-market fit.”

Title: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth Secures 'First and Free' Passage for U.S. Ships in Panama Canal
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/04/13/defense-sec-pete-hegseth-secures-passage-u-s-ships-panama-canal/
Time Published: 2025-04-14T02:28:28Z
Full Content:
PANAMA CITY, Panama — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had one mission on his trip to Panama — to secure a deal to get “first and free” passage for U.S. ships in the Panama Canal, a critical waterway for the United States’ economy and military that was at risk of falling under China’s control. As the secretary and his team flew down from Washington on Monday evening to meet with Panama’s leaders, such a deal with Panama was far from certain. While the U.S. had built the canal in the early 1900s and maintained it for decades before handing it over to Panama in the 1990s, China had in recent years poured money into projects and infrastructure attached to it. As a passageway between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans that handles more than 40 percent of U.S. maritime trade, if China were able to close the canal, it would be a catastrophe for the U.S. President Donald Trump, early on in his administration, made retaking the canal from Chinese influence a top priority. In December, even before he took office for the second time, he posted about it on Truth Social: In February, Trump dispatched Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Panama during his first international trip, where he successfully persuaded Panama to not renew its participation in BRI (the Belt and Road Initiative), a major win for the United States. Then, in March, a Hong Kong-based conglomerated named CK Hutchinson sold two ports along the canal to a consortium led by investment giant BlackRock, which would put the two ports located at each end of the canal under American ownership. Trump touted the deal during his Joint Address to Congress. The Chinese government then launched an investigation into the deal to delay it. Now, it was up to Hegseth to secure U.S. ships’ “first and free” passage through the canal. By all measures, the trip was a resounding success. Hegseth arrived late Monday. On Tuesday, the secretary met with President José Raúl Mulino, Minister of Public Security Frank Abrego, and Panamanian legislators, visited the Vasco Nuñez de Balboa Naval Base that was formerly a U.S. naval base, and inaugurated a pier refurbished by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He also visited Fort Sherman, a former U.S. Army base, the Jungle Warfare School, toured the Panama Canal by helicopter, and visited the Miraflores Locks. He later met with Abrego again, as well as regional leaders attending the 2025 Central American Security Conference. On Wednesday, Hegseth delivered opening remarks at the conference, which was co-hosted by the U.S. and Panama. It was there that Hegseth announced that the U.S. and Panama would sign a declaration providing a framework for U.S. warships and auxiliary ships to travel “first and free” through the canal, in a huge win for the U.S. Hegseth and Abrego also agreed to an expanded partnership to secure the canal and signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperative security activities between the U.S. and Panamanian militaries, which will see the increase of U.S. troops in Panama. Asked by Breitbart News if he had accomplished everything he wanted to on the trip, a triumphant Hegseth responded, “This trip not only met but exceeded our expectations. A warm welcome from Panama. Great partnership. Spent a lot of time with their troops. I want to thank Panama for what they’ve done in the Darien Gap as well.” The trip was not only a success for the U.S. economically, but also geopolitically. Despite Beijing attempting to pressure Panama by launching an investigation into the CK Hutchison’s sale to the BlackRock-led consortium, Panama remained undeterred in its walkaway from China and reinvigorating its ties with the U.S. A senior defense official told reporters traveling with Hegseth, “If you look at the context of countering Chinese spheres of influence around the world, this is a good example of actions taken by the secretary and by his team about how we align perfectly within the realm of that strategy.” “When we talk about the larger global strategy in deterring China … people start to realize very quickly that an alliance with China is not all it [is] cracked up to be,” the official added. “The [Chinese Communist Party] is very exploitative of the relationships that they have and that wasn’t just true of our time in Panama, it was the also the same in Japan.” Senior defense officials also credited Trump for creating the opportunity and confidence for countries who want to work with the U.S. and leave exploitive relationships with China. “President Trump’s words have resonated with them in terms of negotiating the bolstering of our alliances,” another senior defense official said, adding: President Trump made it a point to talk about Panama within his first 30 days of taking office. … The reason why we’re even having this conversation in the first place is because President Trump focused on on the Panama Canal, and I think it’s going to do lot for our country in terms of opportunity with the Panamanians, but ultimately for our hemisphere. During his visit, China responded angrily to the prospect of further cooperation between the U.S. and Panama, accusing the U.S. of “blackmail.” When asked if he was concerned by retaliation by China, Hegseth responded, “No.” “I’m not worried about retaliation from China. We will stand on our own merits. Peace through strength matters. We represent our interests, put America first, President Trump is staring them down on trade. We will reestablish deterrence as well,” he said. Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on X, Truth Social, or on Facebook. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

The ongoing ambiguity has rattled markets, especially Big Tech firms like Apple and Nvidia, with experts warning of severe disruption to supply chains and investor confidence. | Photo Credit: NATHAN HOWARD/Reuters Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. “They're exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they're included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick told ABC's “This Week” on Sunday. President Donald Trump added to the confusion hours later, declaring on social media that there was no “exception” at all because the goods are “just moving to a different" bucket and will still face a 20 per cent tariff as part of his administration's move to punish China for its role in fentanyl trafficking. Apple India produces $22 billion of iPhones in shift from China The Trump administration late Friday had said it would exclude electronics from broader so-called reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren't usually made in the US The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. US Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won't be subject to most of the tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. Apple airlifts 600 tonnes of iPhones from India to beat Trump tariffs, sources say It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. In his post Sunday on TruthSocial, he promised the White House was “taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.” Some had assumed the exemption filed Friday night reflected the president's realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the US any time soon, if ever. The administration has predicted that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the US for the first time, but that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. Semiconductors from China under US scrutiny as Trump warns of fresh tariffs What's more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the US, and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. The turmoil has battered the stocks of tech's “Magnificent Seven” -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven's combined market value had plunged by USD2.1 trillion, or 14 per cent, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to USD 644 billion, or a 4 per cent decline. An electronics exemption would fulfill the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech's hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden's administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump's first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes “a huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House “is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.” Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend.

Title: US stock futures rise amid temporary tariff exemptions for tech products | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Stock futures rose Sunday after a temporary reprieve from tariffs on electronic imports from China by the Trump administration. Dow futures were up 0.5%, or 212 points. The S&P 500 futures rose 0.75%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite futures gained 1.26%, as of 6:18 pm ET. The Trump administration late Friday exempted electronic imports from reciprocal tariffs; any of those goods manufactured in China — like computers, phones and semiconductors — would still be subject to the 20% tariff Trump previously imposed on Chinese goods. The gains come after stocks have seesawed wildly in recent days, as President Donald Trump has levied massive tariffs on US trading partners, then backed off many of those import taxes. Still, confusion about how permanent or temporary some tariff moves could be has stoked uncertainty among investors and kept stocks, the dollar and even US Treasuries under pressure. Tech giants like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) rely on Chinese manufacturing, and the reciprocal tariffs would have made goods like iPhones and other consumer products more expensive. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the exemption was “not permanent.” Other administration officials said another slate of tariffs could be imposed after an investigation into the national security effects of semiconductor imports. Trump posted to his Truth Social platform that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” The back-and-forth on tariffs has caused many investors and others to hold off on major decisions until they get clarity. “Investors will not invest in the United States when Donald Trump is playing ‘red light, green light’ with tariffs and saying, ‘Oh, and for my special donors, you get a special exemption,’” said Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Trump has imposed various tariffs in recent weeks, after repeatedly postponing tariffs on Canada, Mexico and automotive imports. A baseline tariff of 10% went into effect on all countries, and higher rates were imposed on roughly 60 countries deemed the “worst offenders,” including tariffs on Cambodia (49%), Vietnam (46%) and the European Union (20%). Stocks plunged on April 3 after the news, with two consecutive sessions of sell-offs that wiped nearly $6 trillion in market value and continued with another volatile day on Monday, April 7, as the tariff chaos continued.

WFTV Now NASHVILLE, Tenn. — (AP) — Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. White House officials, including President Donald Trump himself, spent Sunday downplaying the significance of exemptions that lessen but won't eliminate the effect of U.S. tariffs on imports of popular consumer devices and their key components. “They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick told ABC's “This Week” on Sunday.

In his post Sunday on TruthSocial, he promised the White House was “taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.” The administration has predicted that the trade war would prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time, but that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What’s more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. The turmoil has battered the stocks of tech’s “Magnificent Seven” — Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven’s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. An electronics exemption would fulfill the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech’s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden’s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump’s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes “a huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick’s comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House “is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.”

Title: Microsoft Prepares for New Round of Layoffs in May 2025

Microsoft is reportedly planning another round of layoffs, expected to begin in May 2025. This strategic move aims to streamline the company's organisational structure by reducing middle management positions and non-technical roles. The goal is to improve efficiency and increase the ratio of engineers to non-engineers within project teams, aligning with broader industry trends seen in tech giants like Google and Amazon. Join TBC's WhatsApp Channel to Stay Updated! Microsoft seeks to reduce bureaucratic layers and enhance the "span of control" for managers, allowing each to oversee more employees. This shift is designed to cut overhead costs and prioritize hands-on technical contributions. The company aims to adjust the "PM ratio" (Product Manager to Engineer ratio) to ensure more engineers are involved in product development compared to managers. This is inspired by Amazon's "Builder Ratio," which emphasizes a higher proportion of engineers to non-builders. Similar restructuring efforts have been undertaken by Google and Amazon, focusing on reducing managerial levels and prioritizing technical talent. Google recently reduced vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency drive. Middle Management and Non-Technical Roles:These positions are expected to be most affected by the layoffs. The exact number of jobs at risk is not yet confirmed, but it could significantly impact certain teams. Performance-Based Considerations:Employees with consecutive low performance ratings may also face scrutiny, although the current layoffs are more focused on restructuring rather than performance-based cuts. Microsoft's planned layoffs reflect a strategic effort to optimize its workforce and enhance operational efficiency. Prioritising technical talent and streamlining management, the company aims to maintain competitiveness in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. Join TBC's WhatsApp Channel to Stay Updated!

Title: An Individual Is Ready To Invest $10,000 And Turns To Reddit For Advice: 'I'm Looking For A Decent Yield And A Little Growth'

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Investing money into dividend stocks can result in steady cash flow. Gradually putting money into these investments will increase your dividend income over time, but some people receive a windfall of cash that they can deploy right away. One Redditor finds themselves in that position. The individual is set to have $10,000 sometime next week and has been following the Dividends subreddit for a while. Now, after consuming content from the group for a while, the Redditor is looking for advice. "I'm looking for a decent yield and a little growth," the Redditor explained when asking for recommendations. Don't Miss: In addition to the immediate $10,000 investment, the Redditor aims to invest $250 each month. Other Redditors shared their thoughts in the comments. One commenter suggested staggering the $10,000 investment instead of putting it all into the market at once. This approach can help the Redditor capitalize on any price dips instead of unloading all of their capital and watching their assets lose value. Many investors on Reddit seem to be jittery about the recent trade war. The popular consensus on Reddit is that the market will continue to tank, and that fear showed up again in the comments. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. An investor who wants to dollar cost average as the market goes down may want to consider breaking the $10,000 investment into several investments. The amount of times you break down the $10,000 should depend on your risk tolerance, your thoughts about current prices, and what you think the stock market will look like in five to 10 years. The original poster mentioned some ETFs and received comments that suggested some ETFs as well. The Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF SCHD was the first ETF the original poster mentioned. It's no surprise to see SCHD mentioned in the Dividends subreddit since it seems to be a fan favorite. The SPDR S&P 500 Trust SPY, JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF JEPQ, and the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI were some of the other ETFs that were mentioned in the post and the comments. See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? However, these recommendations don't mean much since we don't know much about the Redditor. One of the top commenters pointed this out. ‘What to invest in depends a lot on your personal situation. You didn't provide any details about age, income, investment objectives (other than decent yield and a little growth, which is a relative idea), risk tolerance, jurisdiction, investment currency, etc., so it's hard for any meaningful advice to be given." The best stocks and ETFs for one person may be different from the best assets for another person. Some people pursue high-yield stocks as they get closer to retirement, while others buy growth stocks when they are younger to maximize their potential returns. Personal details like risk tolerance and income play a role in which stocks and ETFs make sense for you.

Watch CBS News Updated on: April 13, 2025 / 3:01 PM EDT / CBS News On this "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" broadcast, moderated by Margaret Brennan: Click here to browse full transcripts from 2025 of "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan." MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump's multifront trade war whipsaws markets, and China fires back. What's next, as the world's two biggest economic powers clash? (Begin VT) (CHEERING) ANNOUNCER: The 47th president of the United States! (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: After one of the most volatile weeks in Wall Street history, President Trump spent his Saturday night at a UFC match and hyped his combative approach on trade policy. (Begin VT) DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): We have lots of fights going around the world. And I think we have a lot of good news coming soon about some of those fights. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Despite backing off of what he called reciprocal tariffs against dozens of countries and announcing new exemptions on some key consumer products, the president is digging in on tariffs against China. We will discuss what's next with U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer. And we will get a read on the economic impact from the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari. Silicon Valley's congressman, Democrat Ro Khanna, will weigh in on how the trade war may impact big tech. Plus, we will have a new poll on how Americans think Trump is handling the economy. And, finally, an update on the measles outbreak with the former top vaccine regulator with the FDA Dr. Peter Marks. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Our new CBS poll shows President Trump's job approval rating has fallen to 47 percent. That's a three-point drop since President Trump announced his global tariff plan as part of what he called liberation day. That's a drop, but it is still a better approval rating than he ever saw in his first term. We will have more on that in just a few minutes. The president hiked tariffs on imports from China to 145 percent last week, and Beijing responded with a 125 percent tariff on American goods sold in China. Late Friday, President Trump changed course again, lifting some of those duties off of Chinese-made tech products, including smartphones, chips and computers. Speaking with reporters last night, the president said more details would be revealed Monday. For more, we go to United States Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer. Good morning to you, Mr. Ambassador. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER (U.S. Trade Representative): Good morning, Margaret. How are you? MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm well. I'm hoping you can give us some news of movement on this clash. Is the Trump administration opening any kind of channel to Beijing right now? Are there any plans for presidents Trump and Xi to speak? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Right now, we don't have any plans on that. This issue is truly at the leaders level. Before April 2, I had a conversation with my counterpart, and others did since April 2. We have this at the leaders level. And, at some point, as President Trump has pointed out, we expect that we'll be able to have a conversation with them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China holds about $1.5 trillion in assets in this country. About half of them are U.S. treasuries. In the past, you've talked – you've spoken about strategic decoupling from China and acknowledged it would cause some short-term pain. Are you trying to get China to sell some of those assets? Is that part of your goal as well? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's not part of this plan. President Trump has a global program to try to reshore American manufacturing and address the trade deficit. It's a global issue. The only reason we're really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate. So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, we want to negotiate with the Americans. And the Chinese made a different decision. So, it's not a plan to do that. It was a Chinese decision. They have agency here. MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you prepared for China to consider selling assets it holds in the United States? And do you want that to happen? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, remember, China has been selling off treasuries for some time. It's not a – it's not a brand-new development. You know, the treasuries market will fluctuate. You know, I'm not the Treasury secretary, so I'm not the best poised to talk about that. But I think the issue is, we've become so dependent on China, and for so many decades, we haven't had fair market access. And so – so again, we see China taking action, implementing their policy to try to be less tied up with us as well. So, it's not – it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves. We obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, last Friday, late in the day, the administration published some exceptions to the tariffs on countries including China with smartphones, computers, electronics and machines that make semiconductor computer chips. Last Sunday, on this program, the commerce secretary told us the tariffs are part of a strategy to bring high-tech factories to the U.S. Take a listen. (Begin VT) HOWARD LUTNICK (U.S. Commerce Secretary): The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America. It's going to be automated. And great Americans, the tradecraft of America is going to fix them, is going to work on them. Our high school-educated Americans, the core to our work force, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: But now those high-tech items are given these exceptions. So, is the goal still to move electronics manufacturing to the United States? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: We certainly need to have semiconductors and the downstream electronics supply chain move to the United States. What happened is – it's not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it. What happened is, this type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime, where we have studies ongoing for pharmaceuticals, for semiconductors, metals, et cetera. So, it's not that they won't be subject to tariffs geared at reshoring. They'll just be under a different regime. It's shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs. MARGARET BRENNAN: But those tariffs aren't in place? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: So they are exempt from them. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That is – that is subject to study by the Commerce Department. MARGARET BRENNAN: But… AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: For now, they're subject to a 20 percent tariff. They're subject to a 20 percent tariff that's on China. MARGARET BRENNAN: The commerce secretary was on another network this morning, and he said semiconductors are – quote – "exempt from reciprocal tariffs, but that won't be a permanent sort of exemption." Here's what you told my colleague Nikole Killion April 8. (Begin VT) NIKOLE KILLION: Why aren't there any exemptions with some of these tariffs, sir? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: The president decided that we're not going to have exemptions. We can't have a Swiss cheese solution to this universal problem that we're facing. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I hear you saying the carve-outs are temporary, but isn't that still the Swiss cheese situation you said you were trying to avoid? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I would just disagree with that, Margaret. We have two different tariff programs. You have the global reciprocal tariff getting at the trade deficit, and you have critical sector national security tariffs, where we – we have tariffs in place on auto, steel and aluminum, and we have them coming on semiconductors in the supply chain, pharmaceuticals, lumber, copper, et cetera. They're just different approaches to do it. We have to be much more deliberate about the semiconductor supply chain… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: … because we don't even import semiconductors, as such, that much, right? They go into downstream products. So, we have to be very careful. And we want the whole supply chain here, not just one product. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president said on Monday he'd be much more specific. Will we see those sectoral tariffs announced? I mean, he – he's saying he's already putting big tariffs on pharma. You're telling me that there's going to be an investigation into it. That's something that sounds like it's far in the future. What – what time frame are we talking about? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, you have – for the national security tariffs, you have to do an investigation in order to impose the tariffs. That's just legal process. That's – that's how we do it. That's how it's done for steel, aluminum, autos, et cetera. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you've decided the outcome. (CROSSTALK) AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: …. investigations for those. No, we have not. We have not. That's why they're exempt. That's why they're – you know, they don't have a tariff covered right now, because you have to go through the investigation to determine the outcome. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Is it… AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: We expect there will have to be some kind of tariff on that, but we have to go through the investigation, figure out what's appropriate. And that – and that's a Commerce Department function to do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. I understand you and the Treasury secretary are going to be meeting on the 17th of – of the month with Japanese officials to talk about the potential of a trade deal. I have been told you've been looking at some of these non- tariff barrier issues that the United States sees problems with in current – including their currency. Are you asking governments to do things like that, not just, you know, to buy into America, but to actually change their own currency and change, like, their central bank policy? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So, our view, Margaret, is that currency manipulation or misalignment, whatever you want to call it, that can have a negative impact on U.S. exporters and unfairly advantage foreign exports into the United States. In the USMCA and in the Japan-China – the Japan-U.S. deal from the first Trump term, we had chapters with the parties committing not to do currency manipulation. You know, the Treasury Department has a statute to avoid that. So we certainly are in these kinds of discussions with these countries to see if they're willing to make these types of commitments as well, as have been done in other contexts. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a pretty big ask. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, the Japanese agreed to it in the first Trump term. The Canadians and the Mexicans agreed to it. This is something that periodically has – has happened over the years. Countries have had to revalue to make sure they aren't giving artificial competition – you know, artificial competitive advantage to their exports. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I mean, it's a big ask because we're in a – we're in a nefarious situation. We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit that Biden left us with. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: It's the highest in human history. And currency is certainly part of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: But – but – but I say it's a big ask because it takes time to negotiate. It could take you longer than 90 days, right? So, does that mean this 90-day reprieve could continue to be renewed? I mean, do you know what happens at the end of 90 days? Is that the amount of time you have to negotiate deals with the 70 countries the White House says are calling? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, I'm – I'm considering that we have 90 days. Before April 2, we were already having many talks with other countries, because everyone knew tariffs were coming. This was – this was not some secret. Everyone knew. And so we already were in conversations with several countries. You know, it's going to be up to these countries to come to the table, continue coming to the table, and make these kinds of offers. I mean, the reality is, we're working around the clock day and night, you know, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: But 90 days could be a rolling deadline, is what I hear you saying? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, I – I would not say that. In the president's Cabinet meeting last week, he was asked about this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And he said, well, we'll see. I mean, my goal is to get meaningful deals before 90 days. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And I think we're going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, the president – I know you were testifying on – on the Hill when the president changed the policy on reciprocal tariffs. He said later to reporters that he didn't have access to lawyers when he made the announcement of the change in policy – quote – "We wrote it up from our hearts. It was written from the heart." He said that a few times. Why doesn't the president have access to trade lawyers when he's announcing policy? These are massive policy shifts. I'm sure there's somebody who could have taken a call. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So that type of – that type of discussion had been happening for – for several days. He's talking about drafting the tweets. He drafted the tweet from his heart. But that kind of policy, that was always a possibility, and the order was drafted by lawyers to ensure that the president could modify the policy to further the underlying goals of the order. So – so lawyer – you know, trade lawyers like – like myself and a huge staff that works for me, White House Counsel, et cetera, they've all been involved from day one to give the president the kind of flexibility he needs to address the emergency he's declared that's – forms the basis for these tariffs. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Greer, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be watching what you get done. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Welcome back to Face the Nation. NEEL KASHKARI (President, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis): Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and we saw soybeans are Minnesota's largest export, something like two billion annually. A lot of those soybeans go to China. Do you have a sense yet of what the sustained trade war with China would cost farmers in the midsection of the country? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's funny you said that. I just heard from an ag leader two days ago in Minnesota, who said that, even if there's a 10 percent tariff from China on soybeans, zero Minnesota soybeans will go to China, because it's a competitive global market. It's a commodity. They will have to go someplace else. And so, in many sectors, whether it's a 10 percent tariff or 50 percent or 100 percent tariff, it has dramatic effect on the trade flows. And so a lot of my folks that I hear from here are quite concerned about it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, Bloomberg was already reporting that China was purchasing soybeans from Brazil, so looking to other suppliers, potentially. I want to ask you more broadly, beyond your state, you said on CNBC this past week, investors may now be saying America is no longer the most attractive place in the world to invest. What makes you say that? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we have to start at what causes a trade deficit. It's just economic math that if investors around the world say one country is the best place to invest, the math works out that that country will have a trade deficit. And part of how that shows up for that economy is, interest rates will be lower across the economy because investors are investing and bringing their money into that economy. So, now, if we're not going to have a trade deficit going forward, then investors must conclude that there are other attractive places to invest too. And as we see yields go up, we're seeing the treasury yields go up. The reason the Fed cares about this is, we have to make sure that it's not inflation that's driving those yields up. It could be that investors are saying, hey, there are other places we also want to invest, that it won't just be everybody wants to pour money in America. So these are very complicated details to sort out. The Fed's job is to keep inflation under control and not let it get unanchored. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, people typically think of U.S. treasuries as the safe thing to buy in a crisis, because they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. So when the president says the bond markets got queasy, and that was part of his decision in delaying these reciprocal tariffs, what does that say to you? How do you interpret that the bond market got spooked like it did? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, I think investors in the U.S. and around the world are trying to determine, what is the new normal in America? You know, I saw an interview on Friday where BlackRock CEO Larry Fink speculated that maybe the 10-year treasury would go to a 5 percent yield. He just offered it as a possibility. We don't know where that new normal level is going to be, and we at the Fed have no ability, zero ability, to affect that destination. And I think markets are searching for, where are these trade negotiations going to end up? Ultimately, that destination, whether it's a 5 percent treasury or 4 or something else, that's 100 percent determined by trade policy and fiscal policy. And I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets about what is that new destination, and we're going to have to watch and see. And, at the Fed, our job is to keep inflation under control so that rate isn't even higher. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And just for our audience, when what – yields going up indicates people are selling treasuries. And when Larry Fink, who I believe is the world's largest asset manager, spoke, he said something about the Fed might not have the ability to do any real easings. Is that what you – what concerned you? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's not a concern. It's just a recognition of the tools that we have. So, we at the Fed, we can manage kind of near-term ups and downs in the economy. But, ultimately, where the economy settles in the long run as a result of all of these renegotiations and these new trade flows and fiscal policy, that new normal is completely out of the Central Bank's control. We cannot affect that. All we can do is keep inflation expectations anchored and try to manage some of the ups and downs on that journey, but that destination is up to the executive branch and Congress, not the Fed. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the tariffs on things like steel and lumber and all the things you use to build a building and a house, those may raise prices. Shelter already was a big contributor to the inflation rate. If – what does all this add up to? Do you have any expectations? It certainly sounds like the trajectory is prices going up. NEEL KASHKARI: Well, there's no question that tariffs, by themselves, are inflationary. They push prices up, just as you articulated. The question is, is it a one-time increase in prices and then prices grow slowly from there, or is it something more sustained and ongoing? And it's the Fed's job to make sure that it's only a one-time adjustment in prices, and nothing longer-term than that. So that's the part that we have a role to play here, and we're committed to doing so. But you're right. Tariffs push up prices and push down economic activity, and that's a challenging situation, because the Fed simply does not have the tools to undo the economic effects of tariffs and a trade war. We can just keep inflation from getting out of hand. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't meet again until, what, May 7? NEEL KASHKARI: In a few weeks, we meet. But, yes, obviously, we are continuing to monitor all the economic data. The economy was fundamentally very healthy January, February, March. The job market has been strong. The underlying inflationary dynamics have been coming down, just as we hoped for and we've been trying to engineer. But, obviously, this is the biggest – in the last month or so, this is the biggest hit to confidence that I can recall in the 10 years that I have been at the Fed, except for March of 2020, when COVID first hit. So when there's that type of hit to confidence, it can have large effects on the economy. And we're monitoring that very carefully through the data and through all of our discussions with businesses all around the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the odds of recession are now 50/50. Goldman Sachs says 45 percent chance of recession. Is the risk that high, in your estimate? NEEL KASHKARI: You know, it's really going to be determined by, is – are there quick resolutions? To your prior guest, are there quick resolutions to these trade uncertainties with our major trading partners? The faster those resolutions come, I think the more that confidence can be restored, and, hopefully, those odds can be brought down. But it is a serious situation. If everybody gets nervous at the same time, businesses and consumers, and they all pull back at the same time, that can lead to an economic downturn just by itself, setting aside the math of what the tariffs end up doing to prices. And so there's a lot to try to unwrap right now, and we're doing our best to try to keep our arms around it. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the financial markets look orderly to you at this point? NEEL KASHKARI: They are. I mean, obviously, the market participants are trying to grasp for, where is this all going to settle? And that's causing volatility as they're – as they're trying to do these assessments. So that volatility is to be expected. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. NEEL KASHKARI: But markets are functioning. Transactions are happening. And so I anticipate that's going to continue. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Neel Kashkari, always good to get your insights. Thank you for joining us. We'll be right back with more Face the Nation. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Tomorrow, CBS Mornings co-host Gayle King will be making history, traveling in an all-woman crew into space. Mark Strassmann has a preview. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): In Blue Origin's training capsule, CBS' Gayle King got a sense of tomorrow's thrill ride, a trip 62 miles straight up to the edge of space. GAYLE KING: And I realize this is so much bigger than just a fun trip, what it represents to young women, to girls, what they're trying to do on space in terms of looking at the planet in another way. MARK STRASSMANN: Space tourism, civilian astronauts, took off four years ago. Three space companies, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic and SpaceX, have rocketed more than 120 people into space, including billionaire Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin's founder, in 2021. Did this moment motivate you to push deeper into the cosmos? JEFF BEZOS (FOUNDER, Amazon): Hell yes. (LAUGHTER) JEFF BEZOS: Yes, absolutely, no doubt. We have to build a road to space. The several tourism missions is about practicing. LAUREN SANCHEZ (Journalist): What are we doing? KATY PERRY (Musician): We're going to space. LAUREN SANCHEZ: Oh, we're going to space. MARK STRASSMANN: Bezos' fiancee, Lauren Sanchez, put together Monday's all female-crew, six accomplished women, including King, pop star Katy Perry, two scientists and a filmmaker. Their 11-minute round-trip adventure will include roughly three minutes of weightlessness, floating in the capsule, looking out a window onto the world below. CBS News space analyst Bill Harwood: BILL HARWOOD: It's something we all marvel at, but I think getting from there to the point where the average person can do this is decades away, if not longer. (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: Liftoff will happen here in West Texas from a launchpad on a mammoth ranch owned by Jeff Bezos. Gayle admits she's both excited and terrified – Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we wish Gayle a very safe flight. Our special coverage of the historic mission will begin tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. Eastern. Be sure to tune in. Face the Nation will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with more from our latest poll on President Trump's economic policies, plus Silicon Valley Congressman Ro Khanna and the former director of the FDA's vaccine program. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: For more on our latest poll on how Americans are reacting to the Trump economic agenda, we're joined now by our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto. Anthony, President Trump put tariffs at the center of his campaign. Now he's enacting them. Is there support for what he's doing? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Like a lot of the way people look at investments, it depends on what you see as your goals and your time horizon. By which I mean, in the immediate we see three quarters of Americans think that tariffs will raise prices. At least in the short term. And a lot think in the long term, too. Now, they're sensitive to that because, as we've discussed for many years, inflation and prices are top concerns right? The second thing we see is an increase in the number of people who think that Donald Trump's policies now are making them financially worse off. And it's not just that movement, but it's the setup against expectations. Back at the start of his term a few months ago, a lot of people thought that his policies would make them financially better off. So, that's a big change. But now let me talk about the time horizon, because this applies to his political base, to Republicans, many of whom say, hold on a second, you can't evaluate this right now. You have to give it six months. You have to give it a year to see how his tariff and trade policies are going to play out. So, with that, they're much more supportive of tariffs and of his approach. They also think that he is just using this as a negotiating tactic. Most of them think that he's going to ultimately remove those tariffs, maybe when he gets what he wants. And so that's why you still see a lot of Republican support for all of this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the White House had said it's not up for negotiation, but then President Trump said there is a negotiation, and that's where there's some of the confusion right now. But you did indicate the approval rating itself is under pressure. Where is that pressure centered? ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, more people say that they like his goals with trade and tariff policies than his approach. And that approach part is weighing on his ratings for handling the economy, which are down, his ratings for handling inflation, tied to what I described about prices, which are also down. But look, the market, in the public mind, is not the economy. There's a - MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not. The stock market isn't. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's a pricing mechanism of the future of the economy. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Exactly. And it is an indicator, especially for people who say they have money, not just in the market, but that their finances are sensitive to what happens in the market. They're much less approving of his approach right now. But having said that, consider also jobs. The public is mixed on whether Trump's approach is going to lead to more manufacturing jobs. Republicans think it will. But again, that's kind of a long-term issue. Back to the politics for a second. You know, people often ask, when does a president own the economy? And right now this looks like Donald Trump's economy. A majority of people say it's his policies that are responsible, either way, good or bad, for how it is, not Joe Biden's. And that, of course, sets things up going forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, great insights. Thank you. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to California Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna, who joins us this morning from another state, Ohio. Good morning to you, Congressman. REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA (D-CA): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to what's happening to Silicon Valley in just a moment on the trade and tech front. But, first off, I want to ask you, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, for any insight you might have on one of the announcements made late on Friday. The president authorized the U.S. military to take over a large swath of public land along the southern border, including in the state of California. And I understand that that means the Pentagon's budget can now be used for things like border security or potentially to even detain migrants in that area. Has Congress been briefed on these plans? Do you have any sense of what's happening? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: We have not. And, Margaret, it's longstanding law that you can't use the military for domestic enforcement. It's a violation of the Constitution. I'm hopeful the Supreme Court would 9-0 rule that way, just like they've ruled that the deportation of Abrego (ph) was unconstitutional. But we have not heard any specifics of it, and it's blatantly against the law. MARGARET BRENNAN: You there were talking about Maryland resident Abrego Garcia, who was detained and then sent to a prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court said that the Trump administration actually has to facilitate getting him back, but they didn't actually rule on whether he was a gang member or not. I mean the Justice Department can't substantiate it. But why did you bring up that specific case as proof of something? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, it just shows that this administration is taking actions that are unconstitutional. Look, Vice President Vance said that the - Abrego was an M-13 gang member with no legal rights here. And the Supreme Court said, well, we don't know. And he does actually have legal rights. And so, similarly, you now have an administration that is using the military for domestic enforcement, which is illegal. And I believe that even this Supreme Court, a conservative Supreme Court, would rule it's unconstitutional. MARGARET BRENNAN: On Garcia, ICE said it was an administrative error that led to this man's arrest in the first place. It seems the Trump administration is saying it's now in the hands of the president of El Salvador, who will be at the White House this week. So, we will watch for developments on that space. But going back to the line of questioning here regarding Armed Services, we understand that the president sent his envoy, Steve Witkoff, to talk to Iranian officials over this past weekend. We don't know much, other than they're going to meet again. But in the meantime, the U.S. military has positioned as many as six B-2 bombers in the Indian Ocean. That's the kind of aircraft that would carry a weapon that could be used to take out underground facilities for a nuclear program. Do you believe President Trump would need congressional approval to carry out a strike, even if it was just in support of Israel leading that attack on Iran? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Absolutely. And almost a third of our B-2 bombers are there. Look, it's unconstitutional what they're doing in Yemen. I said it was unconstitutional when Biden made those strikes. We - they need to come to Congress. And look, the president was elected by the American people to say, we don't want our tax dollars going for more bombing in the Middle East, for more wars in the Middle East. I think he's ignoring the base that actually elected him that does not want more of these strikes. In the case of Yemen, the Saudis had war there for almost ten years. And the - it didn't do anything to address the situation with the Houthis. The president campaigned on diplomacy. He hasn't seen that. And what we're seeing is escalation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see what the diplomacy he's attempting achieves in the near term. But let me ask you why you're out in Ohio talking to us this morning. I understand in the coming days you're also going to go to Connecticut, to Yale Law, on Tuesday. Are you trying to sort of troll Vice President Vance? And, if so, why? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, no. I mean the Cleveland City Club invited me to give a speech on the economy. And let's talk about these tariffs. I mean, they were chaotic and they were totally haphazard. So, you had Howard Lutnick on saying that we were going to bring manufacturing back, electronics manufacturing back to the United States. And they realized suddenly that that wasn't going to happen. Actually, the iPhone price would go up to $1,700 or $2,000. And, by the way, if that manufacturing moved, it would probably move to Malaysia or Vietnam. So, they suddenly reversed. They exempted all of electronics manufacturing, which is about a third of our trade deficit. And I'm here at the Cleveland City Club to say, if you want to have electronics manufacturing here, the way to do it is not blanket tariffs. You have to create an electronic manufacturing hub, the kind we did with the Chips Act. That means investing in tool engineering and workforce. It means having investment tax credits. It means having government buy things from the United States. The president has no plan of how to actually have high-end advance manufacturing in the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the district you represent includes Silicon Valley. So, you must be hearing from some of these CEOs. Who are they lobbying, apparently successfully, to get these carve-outs? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: I think they're talking about sound economic policy. I mean it really would have been - they're talking to anyone they can at the White House. They're talking to anyone they can who has the president's ear. But what they're saying is pretty simple. First they're saying that Howard Lutnick, the screws and the screwing only is about 0.1 percent of an iPhone's cost. I mean you need to - the actual components are memory, are camera, are ram. I mean it's like you - I understand they have 19th century policies of McKinley, but they need to have a 21st century understanding of the economy. And then they're saying, OK, you really want to do this? The iPhone will cost $1,600 to $1,700 but we're not going to be able to bring it back to the United States. We'll go to India. We'll go to Malaysia. We'll go to Vietnam. And if you want to bring back the manufacturing to the United States, you have to invest in the workforce, you have to have some investment tax credit for the facilities, and you have to be able to buy the things we make in the United States. So, all I'm saying is, let's have sound economic policy. And, you know, I saw the poll earlier. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: This is not a hypothetical. This is not something the president will be able to spin. Either we're going to see new factories come, or we're not. And tariffs just aren't going to do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we didn't get a clear answer on when these semiconductor tariffs are coming. But the administration argues they're in the pipeline and that, you know, China's not going to get a free pass when it comes to tech. What is that going to mean for your part of the country? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, it's - again, they don't have any sense of when the tariff will come, when it won't come, and they're against the Chips Act. So, how are you going to - let's say you suddenly put tariffs on China. What it would mean is the production would move to other parts of the Asia. It still isn't going to come here unless you're financing those factories here, willing to buy here. Tariffs can be a tool used as a broader Hamiltonian industrial policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: And that's what I'm here in Ohio to talk about, which is, what is actually going to bring advanced manufacturing to this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. All right, Congressman Khanna, we'll be watching. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy claimed last week that the measles outbreak may be plateauing, but the highly contagious virus continues to spread mostly in unvaccinated people. And the CDC reports that the number of cases topped 700 in 2025 so far. The measles virus, which was once effectively eradicated here in America thanks to widespread vaccination, is now in two dozen states. We spoke Friday with Dr. Peter Marks, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine program, who was forced to resign last month as part of Kennedy's redesign of America's health policy. Our conversation began on the subject of the measles outbreak and the response by the Trump administration. (BEGIN VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Kennedy spoke to my colleague, Dr. Jon LaPook, earlier this week following the death of a second unvaccinated child in Texas due to measles. Kennedy reiterated, people should get the MMR vaccine. Take a listen. DR. JON LAPOOK: What's the position, philosophically, of the federal government in terms of public health? ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (Health and Human Services Secretary): The federal's government's position, my position is, people should get the measles vaccine. But at - if - the - the government should not be mandating those. LAPOOK: Understand. But the - KENNEDY: You know, I've always said during my campaign and - and every part that - every public statement I've made, I'm not going to take people's vaccines away from them. LAPOOK: Right. KENNEDY: What I'm going to do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a sufficient endorsement? PETER MARKS (M.D., Former Director, FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research): As a public health professional, I'm going to tell you what an endorsement of the measles vaccine sounds like right now. If you can hear my voice right now and you have a child that is unvaccinated against measles, we have measles spreading it this country very significantly. You wouldn't put your child in a back seat of a car without being strapped into their car seat. You want to get your child vaccinated against measles so that they don't have a one in a thousand chance of dying from measles if they contract it. There is no reason to put your child at that risk because the vaccine does not cause death. It does not cause encephalitis. And it does not cause autism. So, that's what an endorsement sounds like. Just make the comparison. MARGARET BRENNAN: That has to be extremely frustrating for you as someone who worked in the vaccine space for so long. You clearly feel that this is safe and effective and that not saying it clearly is endangering people. And I understand the frustration. PETER MARKS: Right. So, another way of - yes, no, exactly. Exactly. And - but - there's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks that to not use it is the equivalent of, again, throwing - I mean if you saw a child - if you saw a 15-month-old rolling around in the back seat of a car, you'd probably call child protective services. Now, I'm not saying we should have - we should order parents to do this because I don't want to get into the whole issue of mandates. But we should have a moral responsibility to protect our children against something that could potentially be life-threatening, particularly when it's spreading across the United States the way it is. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said there are people like you who can't speak freely. You can speak freely because you're no longer at the FDA? PETER MARKS: Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying your former colleagues can't directly answer a question, they can't honestly answer a question and endorse a vaccine right now? PETER MARKS: I think it's challenging in this environment for some of them, but you'd have to ask them directly. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. In your resignation letter you wrote of the measles outbreak, and what happens when confidence in science is undermined. You said it's clear truth and transparency are not desired by the secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies. Did you ever speak to him about your concerns? PETER MARKS: So, just a matter of record, I never interacted with the secretary. I don't - I don't intend to engage on, you know, disputing any of that. If the administration can have me come and go, that's fine. The more important thing here is that we deal with the issue at hand, which is vaccine confidence is really important for this country and it's been undermined over and over again over the past years. And now we're seeing the result of this. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are saying here that the man running HHS doesn't take in information, wishes subservient confirmation of misinformation and lies. There's presumed outcomes, is what you're saying? PETER MARKS: I think that my words then spoke for itself. I don't need to belabor it here. You know, science is the pursuit of objective truth for the benefit of mankind. And those of us who believe in it, we - we take it very seriously. And it hurts us deeply when there are those who would undercut the name of science, undercut the very name of science because it's convenient for them to purvey lies. And that's just - it's not OK because at the end of the day I was so strongly affected by what happened last week with the death of a second child, that I actually - I actually used profanity with a reporter without - while - while I was on the record without realizing it, which is something I've never done. I really - I don't believe that we should be saying, well, these are people who believe that they shouldn't be vaccinated because my experience - MARGARET BRENNAN: They're from the Mennonite community. PETER MARKS: The Mennonite community. My experience is that if you meet people on their level, they generally will eventually come around. MARGARET BRENNAN: Many parents probably know ASD diagnosis rates are on the increase in this country. The CDC says the current numbers are one in 36 American children. This is a huge - a very broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. There is no established cause. On Thursday, the HHS secretary, Kennedy, said he's got hundreds of scientists from around the world working on it, and he promised this. KENNEDY: By September we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be - we'll be able to eliminate those exposures. MARGARET BRENNAN: That gives tremendous hope to a lot of people. Do you know anything about that ongoing research? PETER MARKS: I know a minimal amount of effort that's being - going on to try to relook at prior autism research. But I am not aware of what is being discussed there. I cared for leukemia patients for a significant number of years. Giving people false hope is something you should never do. It is absolutely - you could be incredibly supportive of people. But giving them false hope is wrong. If you just ask me, as a scientist, is it possible to get the answer to quickly? I don't see any possible way. And, remember, you're talking to the person who came up with Operation Warp Speed for vaccines. Autism is an incredibly complicated issue. So, we have the issue of diagnosis bias. We don't know how many of those cases are true, how much of this is true growth of autism, how much of this is just that we now have diagnostic criteria and we diagnose it more often. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president of the United States said, something artificial is causing autism rates to go up. On Thursday he said, maybe you stop taking something. You stop eating something. Or maybe it's a shot. But something's causing it. Right after that, RFK appeared at - the HHS secretary appeared on Fox News and dismissed 14 studies that have shown no link between autism and vaccines. He said it is an epidemic. KENNEDY: Epidemics are not caused by genes. Genes can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin. So, we know that it is an environmental toxin that is causing this cataclysm. And we are going to identify it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there scientific evidence ruling out genetics as a cause of ASD? PETER MARKS: There is no - there's no scientific evidence ruling out genetics. In fact, there is data that had been published that say that genetics may contribute to autism. There are, obviously, data that can - that suggest that perhaps environmental factors may. But one has to be incredibly careful, incredibly careful about making associations between environmental factors and autism. There is a wonderful graphic that shows that Coca-Cola increase goes along with the increase in autism, but there's also a wonderful graphic that you can find online that shows that the increase in spending on organic food also goes along with the rise in autism false causality. Scientists do not want to find false causality. We want to find true causality. MARGARET BRENNAN: It stood out to us that Secretary Kennedy has hired someone named David Geier to conduct analysis of the links between autism and vaccines. He was charged by the state of Maryland in 2011 with practicing medicine without a license. That was weeks after his father's medical license was suspended for putting autistic children at risk by giving them a hormone blocking agent. So, what should the public know or expect from the work that he will do for the U.S. government? PETER MARKS: So, all I can say is, I would not - he's - to the best of my knowledge, he's not had any training after college in any of the sciences that we value here. What I think we can expect is the expected, that there will be an association determined between vaccines and autism because it's already been determined. This is not how science is conducted. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: You can find our extended interview with Dr. Marks on our YouTube channel or on facethenation.com. We'll be back in a moment.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

(“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: 'SNL' Highlights: Jon Hamm Hosts a Solid, Occasionally Very Good Episode
URL: https://www.pajiba.com/tv_reviews/snl-highlights-jon-hamm-returns-with-the-white-potus-and-please-dont-destroy.php
Time Published: 2025-04-13T12:33:56Z
Full Content:
By Dustin Rowles | TV | April 13, 2025 Cold Open — It’s a Trump sketch with James Austin Johnson, here comparing himself to Jesus in an Easter sketch because he made the stock market die, then resurrected it, and then it went away again. It works better than usual because much of the cast is frozen behind him in their Jesus garb, and James Austin Johnson calls them out individually until they crack. Except for Emil Wakim: He keeps it stone-faced! They’ve done this before, but I’m a sucker for it. (Score: 6 out of 10) Jon Hamm Monologue — Hamm has some great energy tonight, talking about how he hasn’t hosted since 2010, but he has done something even more important: made 14 cameos. Cameos are even more critical for saving a meandering, flagging show, he says, right before Kieran Culkin walks out for a cameo and, uh, slyly references the Hammoconda. Hamm also insists that Mad Men is better than Succession (agree!) (Score: 6.5 out of 10) CTCBC News — A news channel devoted not to the stock market — because these Check-to-Check Business News viewers don’t invest in the stock market — but to the price of groceries, healthcare, and, uh, Funko Pops. Funny and very relatable. (Score: 7 out of 10) Please Don’t Destroy — A Please Don’t Destroy video this early in the show? It’s good, too. A room of detectives is talking about finding a missing girl, but one detective (Jon Hamm) is most excited about the pizza they’re ordering for the late night — at least until someone says Hawaiian. (Score: 6.5 out of 10) Guess the Correct Answer — It’s a password-style game, and Hamm plays an average guy who doesn’t really wanna play because he’s mostly afraid of saying something that will go viral and ruin his life and my god, that is exactly what he does. Thirty seconds of life-ruining madness. I’m going to make this the Mat sketch of the week, even though I suspect it’s funnier to me than to him. (Score: 7.5 out of 10) The White Potus — It’s The White Lotus, only with the Trump Administration. Some good cameos: ScarJo returns as Ivanka, and the return of Alex Moffat (as Eric Trump) and Beck Bennett, who has two cameos. Jon Hamm is RFK Jr., Chloe is a mash-up of Melania and Parker Posey, and Lizzo plays Belinda. Lots going on here (and I guarantee half the viewers didn’t even realize that Moffat and Beck Bennett left SNL several seasons ago). (Score: 7 out of 10) Weekend Update — The Hamm-hosted show is going so well that it doesn’t need “Update” to bail it out, which is good because the jokes are not great this week (watch here and here). The segments, however, are top-notch: Bowen Yang plays China’s trade representative, who clearly has a lot more tolerance for pain than America; Emil Wakim does a segment on how he’s not that proud to be an American, which involves some Uber Eats jokes; and Sarah Sherman plays Colin’s tax accountant, which — as always — is an excuse for her to make fun of Jost for three minutes. (Score: 6 out of 10) New Parents — A gay couple at a hangout arrives with a new baby, which they didn’t have the night before, and when people ask where they got the baby, they shut them down with variations on, “You can’t ask gay people that.” There are a couple of amusing moments, but it’s not the night’s best offering. (Watch Here) (Score: 4 out of 10) Medication Ad — It’s a medication ad that’s basically a parody of all the other medication ads. Clever, but not to the level of Jon Hamm’s John Ham.(Score: 5.5 out of 10) Icebreaker — A group of strangers play an icebreaker game where everyone says their name and one fact about themselves, and it kind of goes off the rails because one guy’s fact is that his mom killed his dad naked on TV. They can’t all be great! (Watch Here) (Score: 4 out of 10) Average Score: 6 out of 10: Solid episode that flags some after “Update.” Hamm, as always, is a great sport and embraces being the butt of the joke. The episode was more political than usual, too, because that’s how Hamm rolls.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025.

Title: Are Stocks And Yields Signaling Something Sinister?

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. President Trump mentioned bond yields when he paused some tariff increases last week. After the ... More pause, stock registered their third-largest one day gain since 1950. The causes of higher yields and the history of outsized one-day gains are examined. Updated, Apr. 14, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the date of Liberation Day, which was April 2, not April 4. Stocks began trading lower last week, continuing the selloff after President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 2, which sparked the stock plunge in the previous week. The S&P 500 reached bear market territory intraday on Monday, down 21% from the mid-February closing high, as concerns about negative economic consequences from the tariffs grew. On Wednesday, Trump announced a temporary reduction in the reciprocal tariff rates to 10% for 60 countries previously hit with higher tariffs. The tariff rate on China was increased to 125%. Stocks reacted with a record-setting one-day rally on Wednesday as the perceived risk of a global recession and trade war was reduced. Largest 1-Day S&P 500 Gains Since 1950 The easing in tariff worries sent stocks 5.7% higher last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 12.7% below its mid-February high. Though the Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week, the group remains in bear market territory at 22.5% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Performance Notably, in a change from earlier in the tariff-related stock weakness, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose instead of falling. For example, during the week of March 31, when the S&P 500 fell 9.1%, the 10-year yield fell from 4.2% to 4.0%. Last week, yields continued to rise even while stocks were soft in the first half of the trading week. This is important because lower yields can help the economy and are the typical bond reaction during worries about economic growth. In addition, the usual flight to U.S. Treasuries as safe assets helps diversified investors offset some of the stock losses during bear markets. Recall that bond prices rise when yields fall and vice versa. Trump even said the bond market was “getting a little queasy” when he paused the higher tariff rates for 90 days last Wednesday. Interestingly, the rise in yields did not come from higher inflation expectations. Instead, the 50 basis point (0.50%) increase in the 10-year Treasury yield from April 4 to April 11 was from an increase in the real yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding more compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. Typically, this happens when expectations for economic growth increase since investors are less interested in safety and are offered attractive expected returns on risk assets like stocks during these periods. Given the likelihood that higher tariffs will effectively act as a tax increase, they should be a headwind to economic growth. So, the typical primary reason for higher real yields is not the most plausible. Instead, investors in the 10-year Treasury demanded higher yields to invest in U.S. debt for another reason. The drivers probably include several reasons, including increased perceived risk plus seasonal and bond market structural factors. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition The financial market volatility surrounding the tariffs has likely pressured some common trades and arbitrages within the bond market. One way to see this risk is by looking at Treasury asset swaps in which one side pays the fixed coupon on the 10-year U.S. Treasury and receives the variable Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The volatility of the U.S. swap spreads around the tariff announcements suggests that some of these trades could have been liquidated and helped send yields higher. US Swap Spread Looking at a past period of financial stress, similar periods of rising Treasury yields can be seen as swap spreads become volatile. This chart shows swap spreads and the 10-year yield around the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Mar. 10, 2023. US Swap Spreads: Silicon Valley Bank Collapse Period There is also talk that some parties had highly leveraged basis trades in place and were forced to unwind them during the volatility, pushing yields higher. Basis trades attempt to profit from the difference between a futures price and a similar bond price. The recent decline in the U.S. dollar relative to other countries’ currencies could be evidence that other countries are selling some U.S. Treasuries. Investors from different countries might also be demanding a higher yield to compensate them for the falling value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. US Dollar Weakness Seasonally, one could also expect some pressure on yields as tax payments are due on April 15. Both individual and corporate taxpayers could be liquidating or not demanding as many Treasury bonds to have cash available to make their tax payments. In addition, with the robust rally in risk assets last week, higher yields should be expected. In summary, it looks unlikely that the tariffs caused permanent damage to the status of the U.S. dollar and Treasuries as a safe haven. The primary focus will likely remain on tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Late last Friday, smartphones, computers, and other electronics were excluded from the tariffs, including those from China. Companies like Apple, which sources significant electronics from China, should see some relief. Since the consumer is the key to U.S. economic growth, Wednesday’s retail sales remains notable. The data will still be looked at skeptically since the full brunt of the tariffs will not be reflected in the March numbers. First quarter earnings season began slowly last week, with a few large banks reporting on Friday. The pace picks up slightly this week, with more banks and notable companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), and Netflix (NFLX) scheduled to report earnings. While the last quarter’s earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. S&P 500 Earnings Season The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which is also called the fear gauge, can help illustrate the level of fear that gripped the markets around the tariff announcements. The VIX measures the expected volatility in the price of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, using the implied volatility of options on stocks. Some market participants use volatility to measure risk since it is the only thing that can be easily measured. In reality, price volatility does not indicate risk for long-term investors. Still, the probability of a permanent capital loss is not easily measured, so volatility is used instead. Within the plumbing of financial markets, higher volatility tends to cause a reduction in liquidity across most assets as those parties typically providing liquidity reduce the size of their capital at risk. This lower liquidity can cause large swings to the downside and the upside. Volatility Risk Last Wednesday, the S&P 500 had its third-largest one-day gain since 1950. Some have posited that extreme one-day gains are associated with bear markets rather than a positive stock outlook. Using data from Strategas Research Partners, the shorter-term periods following these large jumps have indeed seen mixed results. For example, the S&P 500 was higher 58% of the time in the three months after the 25 most significant one-day gains since 1950. Things look significantly better when the investment horizon is lengthened to a year, with the S&P 500 higher almost 92% of the time. Frequency Of Positive S&P 500 Returns After Large 1-Day Gains Further bringing home the point, the range of returns for those shorter periods following the outsized one-day gains is quite sizable. If history is a guide, the risk versus reward for investors looking out a year looks appetizing. Range Of Returns Following Large 1-Day Gains It seems reasonable from the history of stock returns following the largest one-day gains and the unsettled tariff situation that investors should expect volatility to persist for some time. Stocks have provided the highest long-term annualized return of any asset class, but the price for that stellar history is periods of intense volatility and temporary steep declines. Stock’s dominance in growing wealth relative to other investments was achieved through world wars, trade wars, severe economic downturns, financial crises, and pandemics. So, there is no reason to believe that increased tariffs, a hotter trade war with China, or a recession will change the long-term positive outcome, though it can make the short-term uncomfortable.

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. President Trump mentioned bond yields when he paused some tariff increases last week. After the ... More pause, stock registered their third-largest one day gain since 1950. The causes of higher yields and the history of outsized one-day gains are examined. Updated, Apr. 14, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the date of Liberation Day, which was April 2, not April 4. Stocks began trading lower last week, continuing the selloff after President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 2, which sparked the stock plunge in the previous week. The S&P 500 reached bear market territory intraday on Monday, down 21% from the mid-February closing high, as concerns about negative economic consequences from the tariffs grew. On Wednesday, Trump announced a temporary reduction in the reciprocal tariff rates to 10% for 60 countries previously hit with higher tariffs. The tariff rate on China was increased to 125%. Stocks reacted with a record-setting one-day rally on Wednesday as the perceived risk of a global recession and trade war was reduced. Largest 1-Day S&P 500 Gains Since 1950 The easing in tariff worries sent stocks 5.7% higher last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 12.7% below its mid-February high. Though the Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week, the group remains in bear market territory at 22.5% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Performance Notably, in a change from earlier in the tariff-related stock weakness, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose instead of falling. For example, during the week of March 31, when the S&P 500 fell 9.1%, the 10-year yield fell from 4.2% to 4.0%. Last week, yields continued to rise even while stocks were soft in the first half of the trading week. This is important because lower yields can help the economy and are the typical bond reaction during worries about economic growth. In addition, the usual flight to U.S. Treasuries as safe assets helps diversified investors offset some of the stock losses during bear markets. Recall that bond prices rise when yields fall and vice versa. Trump even said the bond market was “getting a little queasy” when he paused the higher tariff rates for 90 days last Wednesday. Interestingly, the rise in yields did not come from higher inflation expectations. Instead, the 50 basis point (0.50%) increase in the 10-year Treasury yield from April 4 to April 11 was from an increase in the real yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding more compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. Typically, this happens when expectations for economic growth increase since investors are less interested in safety and are offered attractive expected returns on risk assets like stocks during these periods. Given the likelihood that higher tariffs will effectively act as a tax increase, they should be a headwind to economic growth. So, the typical primary reason for higher real yields is not the most plausible. Instead, investors in the 10-year Treasury demanded higher yields to invest in U.S. debt for another reason. The drivers probably include several reasons, including increased perceived risk plus seasonal and bond market structural factors. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition The financial market volatility surrounding the tariffs has likely pressured some common trades and arbitrages within the bond market. One way to see this risk is by looking at Treasury asset swaps in which one side pays the fixed coupon on the 10-year U.S. Treasury and receives the variable Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The volatility of the U.S. swap spreads around the tariff announcements suggests that some of these trades could have been liquidated and helped send yields higher. US Swap Spread Looking at a past period of financial stress, similar periods of rising Treasury yields can be seen as swap spreads become volatile. This chart shows swap spreads and the 10-year yield around the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Mar. 10, 2023. US Swap Spreads: Silicon Valley Bank Collapse Period There is also talk that some parties had highly leveraged basis trades in place and were forced to unwind them during the volatility, pushing yields higher. Basis trades attempt to profit from the difference between a futures price and a similar bond price. The recent decline in the U.S. dollar relative to other countries’ currencies could be evidence that other countries are selling some U.S. Treasuries. Investors from different countries might also be demanding a higher yield to compensate them for the falling value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. US Dollar Weakness Seasonally, one could also expect some pressure on yields as tax payments are due on April 15. Both individual and corporate taxpayers could be liquidating or not demanding as many Treasury bonds to have cash available to make their tax payments. In addition, with the robust rally in risk assets last week, higher yields should be expected. In summary, it looks unlikely that the tariffs caused permanent damage to the status of the U.S. dollar and Treasuries as a safe haven. The primary focus will likely remain on tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Late last Friday, smartphones, computers, and other electronics were excluded from the tariffs, including those from China. Companies like Apple, which sources significant electronics from China, should see some relief. Since the consumer is the key to U.S. economic growth, Wednesday’s retail sales remains notable. The data will still be looked at skeptically since the full brunt of the tariffs will not be reflected in the March numbers. First quarter earnings season began slowly last week, with a few large banks reporting on Friday. The pace picks up slightly this week, with more banks and notable companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), and Netflix (NFLX) scheduled to report earnings. While the last quarter’s earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. S&P 500 Earnings Season The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which is also called the fear gauge, can help illustrate the level of fear that gripped the markets around the tariff announcements. The VIX measures the expected volatility in the price of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, using the implied volatility of options on stocks. Some market participants use volatility to measure risk since it is the only thing that can be easily measured. In reality, price volatility does not indicate risk for long-term investors. Still, the probability of a permanent capital loss is not easily measured, so volatility is used instead. Within the plumbing of financial markets, higher volatility tends to cause a reduction in liquidity across most assets as those parties typically providing liquidity reduce the size of their capital at risk. This lower liquidity can cause large swings to the downside and the upside. Volatility Risk Last Wednesday, the S&P 500 had its third-largest one-day gain since 1950. Some have posited that extreme one-day gains are associated with bear markets rather than a positive stock outlook. Using data from Strategas Research Partners, the shorter-term periods following these large jumps have indeed seen mixed results. For example, the S&P 500 was higher 58% of the time in the three months after the 25 most significant one-day gains since 1950. Things look significantly better when the investment horizon is lengthened to a year, with the S&P 500 higher almost 92% of the time. Frequency Of Positive S&P 500 Returns After Large 1-Day Gains Further bringing home the point, the range of returns for those shorter periods following the outsized one-day gains is quite sizable. If history is a guide, the risk versus reward for investors looking out a year looks appetizing. Range Of Returns Following Large 1-Day Gains It seems reasonable from the history of stock returns following the largest one-day gains and the unsettled tariff situation that investors should expect volatility to persist for some time. Stocks have provided the highest long-term annualized return of any asset class, but the price for that stellar history is periods of intense volatility and temporary steep declines. Stock’s dominance in growing wealth relative to other investments was achieved through world wars, trade wars, severe economic downturns, financial crises, and pandemics. So, there is no reason to believe that increased tariffs, a hotter trade war with China, or a recession will change the long-term positive outcome, though it can make the short-term uncomfortable.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: What Analysts Think of Netflix Stock Ahead of Earnings

Netflix (NFLX) is scheduled to report first-quarter results after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts suggesting the streaming giant could be well-positioned to weather an uncertain macroeconomic environment. In a recent note to clients, JPMorgan called Netflix the “most resilient” company it tracks, given the streamer's strong subscriber base, with members watching an average of two hours of content per day. The bank holds an “overweight” rating and $1,025 price target for the stock. Morgan Stanley also named Netflix a "top pick," expecting the company could “demonstrate relative resilience in a weaker global macro.” All told, 14 of the 18 analysts covering Netflix tracked by Visible Alpha have "buy" or equivalent ratings for the stock, with the remainder issuing a "hold" rating. Their consensus price target of about $1,097 would suggest 12% upside, after the stock surged Tuesday following a report Netflix aims to double its revenue and join the $1 trillion market capitalization club by 2030. Netflix is expected to report first-quarter revenue of $10.5 billion, up 12% year-over-year, and net income of $2.47 billion, or $5.67 per share, rising from $2.33 billion, or $5.28 per share, a year earlier. Netflix shares have risen nearly 60% over the past 12 months, at $976.28 as of Tuesday's close.

Title: Konstantinos Sinanas: The Greek engineer who brought Alexa’s voice to the Orion spacecraft

Konstantinos Sinanas, an acoustic and computer systems engineer who has worked for some of the largest tech companies in America—including Amazon, HP, Harman-Samsung, Synaptics, MeyerSound, and Crestron—is the Greek engineer who participated in the Artemis I – Callisto space program. The project was carried out in collaboration with NASA, Lockheed Martin, and Amazon, and he succeeded in realizing Jeff Bezos’s vision: enabling crews to give voice commands to Alexa and have them executed by the spacecraft‘s systems. “Many people tell me this project is an experience I’ll be able to share for the rest of my life. Science fiction became reality,” says the Greek Distinguished Technologist Konstantinos Sinanas in an interview with the Athens News Agency (APE), explaining that, “In the Artemis I – Callisto space program (a collaboration between NASA, Lockheed Martin, and Amazon), I was the Acoustic Design Lead for integrating Alexa into the Orion spacecraft. The project began during the pandemic, and there had been several failed attempts by other colleagues and teams before I took over. The pressure was immense—there was no room for failure, as it would affect not only me but also the future of Alexa, Amazon, Jeff Bezos personally, Lockheed, NASA, and the reputation of the United States in general.” There is no room for mistakes in space “In anything related to space, mistakes are not an option. Once the launch happens, you need to be 100% sure the systems will work. If there’s a problem, you can’t just ‘go and fix it.’ That’s why, beyond exhaustive system simulations, I insisted on on-site tests at the Orion mockup in Houston. Even though that caused a lot of friction and difficulties, I was certain it was the only way to succeed—and in the end, we did,” Mr. Sinanas emphasizes. Speaking about the field he has served for decades, he explained that he works on the research and development of microphones and micro-speakers—whether embedded in devices or as peripherals (wired/wireless headsets, speakers, microphones, etc.)—covering both consumer and professional audio products, including mobile phones, laptops, and smart devices. At the same time, he designs and equips audio labs and studios and conducts acoustic studies for spaces and installations. 15 Years in America’s Leading Tech Companies “In recent years, Konstantinos Sinanas worked at HP as a Distinguished Technologist at the R&D center, focusing on audio hardware and software, acoustics, innovation, and artificial intelligence. In addition to his main responsibilities, I also had the role of ambassador for international standards and specifications, mentor, and HP representative in global technology forums,” he notes. He explains that over the 15 years he worked in the U.S., he collaborated closely with companies such as “Microsoft, Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, Texas Instruments, Cirrus Logic, Qualcomm, Realtek, Dolby, DTS, Waves, and other HW/SW suppliers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia to create new HP technologies, applications, and products. This gave me the opportunity to work with the entire group of tech giants in Silicon Valley and to gain knowledge and connections I never imagined possible—even though I already had experience with major projects through Harman, with companies such as Google, Apple, JBL, AKG, Huawei, Lenovo, Dell, Asus, Oculus, Bloomberg, LG, and many others.” The Financial Crisis Pushed Him to America “Although I had a successful career in Greece as an educator and engineer, since 2007 I had started to see that the future of the country—especially for those who wanted to grow professionally and financially—was looking bleak. After much thought, sacrifices, and taking a big risk, I made the decision to move to the U.S. in 2010, along with my wife. We have lived in Astoria (New York), Edgewater with Crestron, Los Angeles with Harman-Samsung, Irvine, Orange County with Synaptics, Berkeley with MeyerSound, Santa Clara with Amazon, and in Houston, Texas, with HP,” he notes. When asked whether there’s a secret to success, Konstantinos Sinanas replies, “There are many—not ‘secrets,’ but talents, capabilities, and skills one must possess to build a successful career. It takes a combination of talent, specialized knowledge, flexibility, and continuous development. From crafting the right resume and handling interviews, to managing relationships with colleagues, partners, and the company. Consistency, productivity, integrity, and effectiveness are essential to surviving in the competitive tech space—especially in the U.S.” The Tech Sector Is Facing a Crisis in the U.S. Commenting on the current state of the tech industry in the U.S., he clarified, “Over the past two or three years, the tech sector has been facing a crisis due to poor policy and corporate strategic decisions. This has led to mass layoffs, downsizing, or closure of companies, with serious social consequences. Unfortunately, the reforms now being implemented should have happened a decade ago. Although they may seem strict or confusing to many, they are necessary to avoid worse outcomes for the future of the U.S.” What Comes Next? A Return to Greece As for his future plans? Konstantinos Sinanas answers spontaneously, without a second thought:“My goal is to return permanently to Greece and offer everything I gained abroad—knowledge, experience, innovation, and connections—into education, production, and research. Important efforts are being made, but I believe we still have a long way to go for our country to move forward. I hope that my wife and I will succeed in settling permanently in our homeland.” Explore related questions

April 12, 2025 21:30 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, April 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Rocket Lab and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until April 28, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On February 25, 2025, Bleeker Street Research (“Bleeker Street”) published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” Following publication of the Bleeker Street report, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21 per share, or 9.83%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: Trump administration says it will exclude some electronics from tariffs

The Trump administration late Friday said they would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren’t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia and sets the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won’t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. It’s the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. The exemption seemed to reflect the president’s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration’s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What’s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump’s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech’s “Magnificent Seven” — Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point earlier this week, the combined Magnificent Seven’s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. Now, the stage is set for another tech rally Monday when trading resumes in the U.S. stock market, with Apple likely leading the way because the iPhones made in China remain the company’s biggest money maker. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It’s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech’s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden’s administration’s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump’s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off “a huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

Title: Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft can 'breathe a huge sigh of relief' after Trump's China tariff exemptions

The ever-growing U.S. tariffs on imports from China won’t bite Big Tech so badly after all, after the Trump administration late Friday laid out significant exemptions from its wider trade war that include smartphones, laptop computers, chips, and more. The exemptions, published by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, amount to a huge break for tech giants such as Apple (AAPL+2.21%), Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%), and Microsoft (MSFT+0.24%), and for the broader tech industry, even as uncertainty persists over the direction of President Donald Trump’s trade war. It means some of the most crucial and high-end technology imports — which overwhelmingly aren’t made in the U.S. — won’t be subject to Trump’s 125% tariff on China, or his baseline 10% tariff on almost every other country. A Wall Street analyst quickly called it “the best news possible for tech investors.” “The U.S. tech industry has a loud voice and despite initial strong pushback against exemptions within the White House, the reality of the situation was finally recognized in the Beltway,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note Saturday. “There is still clear uncertainty and volatility ahead with these China negotiations. Big Tech firms like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and the broader tech industry can breathe a huge sigh of relief this weekend into Monday.” The exemptions follow a pattern from Trump’s first term, when Apple in particular saw significant success in lobbying Trump for trade war carveouts. Making products such as the iPhone in America would be almost economically impossible. Wedbush had warned earlier this month that Apple faced a “complete disaster” from the China tariffs. And the Trump administration’s move came as its trade war has driven days of volatility in financial markets, as well as cratering consumer confidence and growing recession fears. Ives called the exemptions “a big step forward for U.S. tech to get these exemptions and the most bullish news we could have heard this weekend. ... Big Tech is back off the cliff with these exemptions and this changes the entire situation for tech stocks with this black swan event for the industry removed.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. White House officials, including President Donald Trump himself, spent Sunday downplaying the significance of exemptions that lessen but won't eliminate the effect of U.S. tariffs on imports of popular consumer devices and their key components. Recommended Videos “They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick told ABC's “This Week” on Sunday. Trump added to the confusion hours later, declaring on social media that there was no “exception” at all because the goods are “just moving to a different" bucket and will still face a 20% tariff as part of his administration's move to punish China for its role in fentanyl trafficking. The Trump administration late Friday had said it would exclude electronics from broader so-called reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for phones and other consumer products that aren’t usually made in the U.S. China's commerce ministry in a Sunday statement welcomed the change as a small step even as it called for the U.S. to completely cancel the rest of its tariffs. Sparing electronics was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an anticipated tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won’t be subject to most of the tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. It was the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. White House officials sought to dismiss any suggestion of a reprieve as the weekend progressed. “It’s not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it,” U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “This type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime.” Greer added that “the president decided that we’re not going to have exemptions. We can’t have a Swiss cheese solution to this universal problem that we’re facing.” On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. In his post Sunday on TruthSocial, he promised the White House was “taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN.” Some had assumed the exemption filed Friday night reflected the president’s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever. The administration has predicted that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time, but that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., burdening Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone and torpedo sales of its marquee product.

Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House “is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.” Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to requests for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ O'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

The Trump administration late Friday had said it would exclude electronics from broader so-called reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for phones and other consumer products that aren’t usually made in the U.S. China's commerce ministry in a Sunday statement welcomed the change as a small step even as it called for the U.S. to completely cancel the rest of its tariffs. Sparing electronics was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an anticipated tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won’t be subject to most of the tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. It was the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. White House officials sought to dismiss any suggestion of a reprieve as the weekend progressed. “It’s not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it,” U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “This type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime.” Greer added that “the president decided that we’re not going to have exemptions. We can’t have a Swiss cheese solution to this universal problem that we’re facing.” On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. In his post Sunday on TruthSocial, he promised the White House was “taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN.” Some had assumed the exemption filed Friday night reflected the president’s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever. The administration has predicted that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time, but that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., burdening Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone and torpedo sales of its marquee product. The turmoil has battered the stocks of tech’s “Magnificent Seven” -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven’s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. An electronics exemption would fulfill the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech’s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden’s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump’s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. An electronics exemption would remove “a huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House “is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.” Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to requests for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ O'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

Title: Tax Breaks: The Week That Turned Out To Be A Wild Ride Edition

ByKelly Phillips Erb ByKelly Phillips Erb, Forbes Staff. The week was a rollercoaster for investors. The big news this week was the stock market. U.S. stocks tumbled as traders grappled with the consequences of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The S&P 500—a stock market index tracking the stock performance of 500 leading companies in the U.S.—which hit a record high on February 19, dropped quickly on Tuesday, the second-fastest such drop in history (lagging only behind the drop due to Covid). Stocks powered back after Trump announced a 90-day reprieve on most tariffs but dropped again. By the end of the week, investors felt like they had motion sickness after one of the most volatile periods on record for Wall Street. Losing money inside your brokerage or retirement account may hurt—but it doesn’t necessarily mean a loss for federal tax purposes. Markets go up and down—it's the nature of the beast. When the market goes down, that doesn't equal an actual or realized loss for tax purposes. Similarly, when the market goes back up, that doesn't equal a real or realized gain for tax purposes. For tax purposes, gains and losses aren't determined moment to moment or from those highs and lows, but how much your cost basis has gone up or down from when you acquired the asset to the disposition of the asset. To realize a gain or a loss for tax purposes, you must do something with the asset. Typically, that means that you sell it or otherwise dispose of it. (The tax rules can be more complicated for day traders.) Things were equally as hectic at the IRS. A Treasury announcement confirmed that Melanie Krause, the acting commissioner of the IRS, was leaving her position. The announcement followed the news that the tax agency agreed to share immigrant tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Under the agreement, the IRS will verify the names and addresses of immigrants provided on tax records to ICE. It's unclear what other information may be provided by the IRS. However, an initial lawsuit suggests it could include information about dependents and other personal information. Krause stepped in as acting commissioner in early March following the retirement announcement of Doug O'Donnell. O'Donnell had served in the role for just a few short weeks following former IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel's departure on January 20, 2025 (one week before the tax season officially kicked off). O'Donnell's departure on February 28 marked a remarkable 39-day span of rotating commissioners. Krause becomes the third commissioner or acting commissioner to leave the agency in less than 80 days. The IRS is also bracing for more cuts in its workforce. Thousands of agency employees are expected to receive pink slips in mid-May, about a month after Tax Day, April 15. About 11,000 cuts are predicted, bringing the total loss of employees in the first half of 2025 to 20,000. With a few days left before Tax Day, cracks are showing at the IRS. Millions of taxpayers are expected to file their federal income tax returns by the end of the day on April 15, 2025, with millions more expected to file for an extension. It's not the ideal time for mistakes to appear on the IRS website, but that's precisely what is happening. Potentially confusing errors are popping up on the site, including one that impacts taxpayers filing for an extension. Specifically, the extension payment date for taxpayers who log into the IRS website is incorrect. While payment should be made by April 15, 2025, taxpayers who log in to pay see an April 22, 2025, due date. The site says, "Your payment is due on April 22, 2025, regradless of filing for an extension." (Yes, the 'regradless' typo is on the IRS site, too). Multiple other errors appear on the site, including misidentifying the amended tax form as Form 104X (it's Form 1040X) that was recently “filled” instead of “filed.” The mistakes prompted Wendy Marsden, a CPA and author, to quip on BlueSky, “This is feeling like the website is spoofed and your payments will go straight to Russia.” It would be funny if it weren’t true. The timing raised eyebrows so close to Tax Day. It’s not clear when the changes were made—so far, there's been no answer. However, on Wednesday, Elon Musk tweeted on X (formerly Twitter) that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had made a fix to the IRS website. Multiple tax professionals and some groups have reached out to the IRS. The IRS confirmed that it was investigating. As we look ahead to next week, here’s hoping it’s not quite so exciting. Don’t forget to file your return—or request an extension—by April 15, 2025. Check back with Forbes early next week for a list of deals and specials to make the day a little less taxing.

Not a subscriber yet? Click here to sign up. Should you pay your taxes with a credit card? This week, a taxpayer asked: I can’t pay my taxes in full. Can I pay with a credit card? You can definitely pay your taxes with a credit card—either online or over the phone. But should you? That’s more complicated. I’m generally not a fan of replacing one kind of debt with another. But if your ability to pay is a timing issue—as opposed to an "I absolutely don’t have it at all" issue—it can make sense to use a credit card to pay off your tax debt. The IRS accepts all major credit cards (American Express, Discover, MasterCard, or Visa). To make a payment, head over to the credit card payment page on the IRS website and choose one of the payment processors to pay online or by phone (if you're paying by credit card and using e-file, your options are here). The IRS doesn’t charge a fee for credit card payments. However, third-party credit and debit card providers may charge a fee, which may vary by provider, card type, and payment amount. Applicable fees for credit cards range from 1.75% to 2.95% (minimum fees apply)—that’s in addition to any fees or interest that your bank may charge. High-dollar payments—those over $1,000,000—must be coordinated with the service provider (you may also need a new tax preparer, just saying). Paying by credit card is a good option if you know you can pay the bill off eventually. Plus, you might earn miles or points to help you book a trip to somewhere amazing to lessen the pain of paying your taxes. That’s the plus side. On the not-so-plus side, credit card interest and other fees can add up, so if you know you won't be able to pay off the balance, consider other options, like an installment agreement with the IRS. An installment agreement lets you pay what you owe over time. Depending on how much you owe, you won’t even have to speak with a real person—if you owe $50,000 or less in combined individual income tax, penalties, and interest, you can apply for an installment agreement online. (If you don’t qualify for an online installment agreement or if you want to apply for an installment agreement by mail, use Form 9465.) Fees apply. Keep in mind that it's cheaper if you sign up online and even less expensive if you agree to pay by direct debit. Other options may be available, too. If you are insolvent or unable to pay due to circumstances beyond your control, the IRS will work with you. Give them a call at 1.800.829.1040 or use the phone number on any notice that you might have received in the mail. — Do you have a tax question or matter that you think we should cover in the next newsletter? We’d love to help if we can. Check out our guidelines and submit a question here. IRS numbers from the tenth week of the tax filing season—the week ending April 4, 2025—suggest that taxpayers are finally ready to file their tax returns. The data shows that the IRS received 101,422,000 individual income tax returns as of April 4, 2025, compared to 101,849,000 as of April 5, 2024. The dip is just .4%, with 427,000 fewer individual tax returns filed to date in 2025 compared to 2024. Most of those returns were e-filed. In 2025, the IRS received 98,184,000 e-filed returns, compared to 98,421,000 in 2024. That’s a drop of .2%. Of those, the IRS reported that it received 53,392,000 individual income returns e-filed by tax professionals and 44,792,000 self-prepared e-filed returns. Tax season data for week ending April 4, 2025 Most tax professionals will e-file your return—not only are some required to e-file (a 2010 requires specified tax return preparers to e-file certain federal income tax returns), the IRS says that e-filing is more secure and more likely to be accurate. As National Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins put it when recommending e-filing: "Paper is the IRS' kryptonite." While a few weeks ago, the number of e-filed returns prepared by professionals was nearly neck and neck with the number of self-prepared e-filed returns, tax professionals now have the edge. Taxpayers with simple returns often e-file early, while those taxpayers with more complicated returns tend to rely on their tax professionals to file. The IRS began the e-file program in 1986 as a pilot project in three cities: Cincinnati (Ohio), Phoenix (Arizona), and Raleigh-Durham (N.C.). That year, there were 25,000 tax returns filed electronically. Last year, the IRS received 151,781,000 e-filed individual returns. Tariffs are already making an impact. Admit it: You haven’t heard about tariffs this much since freshman U.S. history. But with tariffs on again/off again this week, it’s all that many business owners were talking about. (You can find a quick primer on tariffs here.) One of the motivations behind the tariffs is revenue. Peter Navarro, a senior White House trade official, projected that tariffs announced since January would generate about $6 trillion to $7 trillion over 10 years. That would generate enough revenue to fund an extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and some of Trump’s campaign promises, such as tax-free tips, overtime, and Social Security benefits. However, according to a new Tax Policy Center estimate, the tariffs will generate far less tax revenue than the administration claims. TPC estimates Trump’s taxes on imported goods would raise about $3.3 trillion from 2026 to 2035, plus an additional $190 billion for the remainder of 2025, roughly half of Navarro’s prediction. Of course, that was before the pause. That–and raising import taxes on Chinese goods–would cut in half the amount of revenue Trump’s April 2 levies could increase, according to a new TPC analysis. TPC found Trump’s latest plan would raise about $1.7 trillion for the 10 years from 2026 through 2035, plus an additional $125 billion for the remainder of 2025. The analysis assumed that Trump’s latest tariff policy would be permanent, although he said his newly announced delay would last only 90 days. It also assumed the President would eliminate his “reciprocal” import taxes but continue his 10% tariff on worldwide trade and maintain higher tariffs on many goods from Canada and Mexico and on products such as steel, aluminum, and autos and auto parts and raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%. Trump has suggested that the tariff revenue could replace income tax revenue. Earlier this year, he mused that the IRS could be replaced by the External Revenue Service, a new government agency that could be established to oversee the collection of tariff revenue. While abolishing the IRS and eliminating income taxes may sound good to some taxpayers, the practicality of fully replacing tax revenue with tariff revenue is very complex. And while most of the current tariffs–and revenue raisers–are focused on China, tariffs targeted to Canada have raised eyebrows. Trump has suggested that there’s an easy fix, writing on Truth Social, “The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.” Those comments have rankled Canadian politicians, including Canada’s new prime minister, Mark Carney, who said, “The old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over. It’s clear the US is no longer a reliable partner.” And while it’s easy to dismiss the back and forth as political grandstanding, this isn’t the first time Americans have weaponized tariffs. In the late 19th century, President Benjamin Harrison’s secretary of state, James G. Blaine, had a plan: By saddling Canadian imports with heavy new tariffs, the United States could force Canada to seek American statehood. Will history repeat itself? (Spoiler alert: The 1890 tariffs didn’t result in Canada becoming what would have been, at the time, the 45th state.) 📅 April 15, 2025.

The tax agency says that more than $1 billion in outstanding refunds remain unclaimed from the 2021 tax year. The agency estimates that more than 1.1 million taxpayers might have qualified for a refund but did not file a federal income tax return to claim it—you have until April 15, 2025, to file and claim your money. The IRS reminds self-employed individuals, retirees, investors, businesses, and corporations that April 15 is the deadline for first-quarter estimated tax payments for the 2025 tax year. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) commended the leadership of these two Senators on behalf of American businesses and employees through the introduction of the bipartisan Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act of 2025. This bill provides uniformity for nonresident state and local income tax withholding and a reasonable de minimis exception from assessing state and local income tax in a jurisdiction where an employee does not reside. The IRS has published Internal Revenue Bulletins 2025-15 and 2025-16. Law firm Sullivan & Worcester announced that Cameron N. Cosby has joined the firm’s REITs and tax practices as a partner in the Washington, D.C., office. Previously with Fried Frank, Cosby brings over 35 years of experience with tax aspects related to real estate investment trusts (REITs), partnership transactions, and mergers and acquisitions. Remember last week when I wrote that Italy believed they could tax social media? Lawmakers in Minnesota think so, too. Key Minnesota Democrats on legislative tax committees want popular social media platforms to pay tax on the use of consumer data. Under the bill, large companies with more than one million users in the Gopher State would pay $165,000 per month plus $0.50 per person on the sites, while those with fewer than 100,000 users would not pay any tax (those in between would have varied rates). Facebook, owned by Meta, is considered to be the largest social media platform in the world—with over 3.049 billion monthly active users globally. YouTube is the second most used social media platform, with around 2.49 billion monthly active users. — If you have tax and accounting career or industry news, submit it for consideration here or email me directly.

LUCK, TX - MARCH 17: Willie Nelson performs in concert during Luck Reunion on March 17, 2022 in Luck, Texas. (Photo by Gary Miller/Getty Images for Shock Ink) In the 1980s, Nelson was hit with a staggering $16.7 million tax bill, thanks to his involvement in tax shelters. It was one of the largest individual federal income tax bills ever generated by the IRS at the time. The debt was negotiated to a mere $6 million by Nelson's lawyer, but Nelson still didn’t have the money to pay. On November 9, 1990, the feds raided Nelson's home, taking everything he owned except Trigger, Nelson's favorite guitar, which he had his daughter, Lana, take out of his home in anticipation of the raid. "As long as I got my guitar," Willie Nelson said, "I'll be fine." The IRS auctioned off some of Nelson’s belongings but didn't dent Nelson's bill. So, the two sides reached a rather unusual compromise: Nelson would release a compilation album and would share the proceeds with the IRS. The album, “The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?,” was entirely written by Nelson and performed using—what else?—Nelson's trusty guitar, Trigger. It was the first (and maybe only) record album ever released under a strict revenue-sharing agreement with the IRS. The album, which could be purchased by dialing (800) IRS-TAPE, retailed for $19.95. The IRS only collected $3.6 million from the sales of the album. However, by that time, Nelson had settled his lawsuit with Price Waterhouse (whom he had blamed for his tax woes in the first place), and with other projects in the works, Nelson paid off his debt. An IRS spokesperson said about the deal at the time, “We try to work with taxpayers… And if we have to come up with some creative payment plan, that's what we're going to do because it's in everyone's best interest.” How did we do?

Title: Bonds Break, Bullion Breaks Out

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/12/2025 6:02:10 AM PDT by delta7 Global markets have reached a day of reckoning. This has been decades in the making. Now, massive changes are sweeping the world. No, what we’re seeing in the markets is not “normal.” Instead, this is the: Moment precious metal investors have been waiting for Birth of a multipolar world order (U.S. is no longer the sole superpower) Start of a very uncertain period for bonds and fiat currency Peak of globalization In short, you no longer have the luxury of relying on the old rules, the old way of thinking. It’s time for a new playbook. Bond Outlook: Murky Since the early 1980s until recently, U.S. Treasury Bonds have been the perfect compliment to stocks. When stocks were doing poorly, bonds did well. And vice versa. Hence why the 60/40 (60% stocks, 40% bonds) was such a popular portfolio model. This relationship is breaking down. As U.S. stocks have been crashing, the value of bonds is also falling. This can be seen in the chart below, which shows the U.S. 10-year Treasury Bond yield (as the value of the bond falls, the yield rises). This chart shows the yield on the 10-year bond year-to-date. See that big spike in yields over the last week? That’s a worrying sign. Investors are selling bonds when they “should” be buying. Scott Bessent’s Treasury Department has about $9 trillion worth of treasuries maturing over the next year. Those bonds and bills will need to be refinanced. If rates are high when these new treasury securities are issued, the government’s interest costs will soar even higher (already over $1 trillion/year). At some point, the Fed will have to get involved. Emergency rate cuts and eventually a massive new round of QE (money printing to buy treasuries) seem inevitable. Who else is going to buy $9 trillion worth of treasuries over the next year? Eventually the Fed may even have to begin “yield curve control”, which means pegging the yield on treasuries at artificially low levels. For example, during and after WW2, when the U.S. was heavily indebted, the Fed froze the 10-year yield at 2.5%, even as inflation raged as high as 14%. The goal was to dramatically lower U.S. debt-to-gdp levels by encouraging inflation and capping yields. Bond holders and savers got hosed. This is known as financial repression. And it could happen again. Yield curve control and financial repression are probably some years out. But I much prefer to keep the “safe” part of my portfolio in gold and silver instead of government bonds. The upside potential is far higher, and taxes can be deferred for decades (until you decide to sell). Gold and Silver: Just Getting Started Rick Rule famously says, “I don’t own gold because I think it’s going to $3,500. I own it because I’m afraid it’s going to $10,000.” This is an excellent way to look at our current situation. This move in gold, which just surpassed $3,200/oz, is a flashing warning signal. The global debt-based monetary system is on the verge of breaking down. And instead of rushing into treasuries as a safe haven, the world’s central banks are increasingly turning to gold. If you want an idea of just how high gold could potentially go, be sure to read Jim Rickards’ $27,000 Gold if you haven’t yet. This is not an arbitrary price target, but the result of Jim’s careful calculation. Of course, Jim doesn’t guarantee we get there, but it should give you an idea of what’s possible. My message here is that if you’re just now thinking about starting a position in gold, you’re not too late. Interest in precious metal miners is just now picking up. One of the largest gold miners, Newmont (NEM), which we highlighted as a buy last week at around $45, soared to $55 today. And don’t get me started about silver, which is still about 35% below its 2011 high of $49.50. Once we break through silver’s $35/oz level, it’ll be off to the races. I’m a buyer of silver here. And gold miners still haven’t caught up with the spot price of bullion, so I will look to add there on dips. The vast majority of investors still have almost no exposure to gold, silver, and miners. This will change over the coming years. My advice is to get positioned for the shift now. You are not too late.

It was a no-brainer. Stocks were down much more than bonds. The recent 20% drop in SPX was another such opportunity. But personally I did not do the switch this time because stocks are still more overvalued than at peak in 1929 before the crash. 7 posted on 04/12/2025 6:26:18 AM PDT by Bobbyvotes (I am in mid-80's and I am not gonna change my opinions.)

Normally, risk in the equities markets drives dollars into Treasuries. The result is normally a downward move in interest rates. This is important because, for every basis point (0.01%) decrease in the interest rate, the cost of servicing the debt falls by $1 billion per day. Instead, because Congress can't control themselves and spending, money is flowing into precious metals. Not good, as those are not productive uses of capital. Solution: restore confidence in the dollar, which means Congress has got to stop bingeing on debt spending. Elon is doing that, but the GOP has failed miserably in educating the public what's going on. And to those idiots who thought a smaller gov't didn't mean firing public employees, grow up. The GOP should be tarred and feathered for the piss-poor job they've done explaining how short run pinches now means no amputations in the long run. 20 posted on 04/12/2025 7:17:34 AM PDT by econjack [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-29 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

It’s time for a new playbook. Bond Outlook: Murky Since the early 1980s until recently, U.S. Treasury Bonds have been the perfect compliment to stocks. When stocks were doing poorly, bonds did well. And vice versa. Hence why the 60/40 (60% stocks, 40% bonds) was such a popular portfolio model. This relationship is breaking down. As U.S. stocks have been crashing, the value of bonds is also falling. This can be seen in the chart below, which shows the U.S. 10-year Treasury Bond yield (as the value of the bond falls, the yield rises). This chart shows the yield on the 10-year bond year-to-date. See that big spike in yields over the last week? That’s a worrying sign. Investors are selling bonds when they “should” be buying. Scott Bessent’s Treasury Department has about $9 trillion worth of treasuries maturing over the next year. Those bonds and bills will need to be refinanced. If rates are high when these new treasury securities are issued, the government’s interest costs will soar even higher (already over $1 trillion/year). At some point, the Fed will have to get involved. Emergency rate cuts and eventually a massive new round of QE (money printing to buy treasuries) seem inevitable. Who else is going to buy $9 trillion worth of treasuries over the next year? Eventually the Fed may even have to begin “yield curve control”, which means pegging the yield on treasuries at artificially low levels. For example, during and after WW2, when the U.S. was heavily indebted, the Fed froze the 10-year yield at 2.5%, even as inflation raged as high as 14%. The goal was to dramatically lower U.S. debt-to-gdp levels by encouraging inflation and capping yields. Bond holders and savers got hosed. This is known as financial repression. And it could happen again. Yield curve control and financial repression are probably some years out. But I much prefer to keep the “safe” part of my portfolio in gold and silver instead of government bonds. The upside potential is far higher, and taxes can be deferred for decades (until you decide to sell). Gold and Silver: Just Getting Started Rick Rule famously says, “I don’t own gold because I think it’s going to $3,500. I own it because I’m afraid it’s going to $10,000.” This is an excellent way to look at our current situation. This move in gold, which just surpassed $3,200/oz, is a flashing warning signal. The global debt-based monetary system is on the verge of breaking down. And instead of rushing into treasuries as a safe haven, the world’s central banks are increasingly turning to gold. If you want an idea of just how high gold could potentially go, be sure to read Jim Rickards’ $27,000 Gold if you haven’t yet. This is not an arbitrary price target, but the result of Jim’s careful calculation. Of course, Jim doesn’t guarantee we get there, but it should give you an idea of what’s possible. My message here is that if you’re just now thinking about starting a position in gold, you’re not too late. Interest in precious metal miners is just now picking up. One of the largest gold miners, Newmont (NEM), which we highlighted as a buy last week at around $45, soared to $55 today. And don’t get me started about silver, which is still about 35% below its 2011 high of $49.50. Once we break through silver’s $35/oz level, it’ll be off to the races. I’m a buyer of silver here. And gold miners still haven’t caught up with the spot price of bullion, so I will look to add there on dips. The vast majority of investors still have almost no exposure to gold, silver, and miners. This will change over the coming years. My advice is to get positioned for the shift now. You are not too late.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Since the early 1980s until recently, U.S. Treasury Bonds have been the perfect compliment to stocks. When stocks were doing poorly, bonds did well. And vice versa. Hence why the 60/40 (60% stocks, 40% bonds) was such a popular portfolio model. This relationship is breaking down. As U.S. stocks have been crashing, the value of bonds is also falling. This can be seen in the chart below, which shows the U.S. 10-year Treasury Bond yield (as the value of the bond falls, the yield rises). This chart shows the yield on the 10-year bond year-to-date. See that big spike in yields over the last week? That’s a worrying sign. Investors are selling bonds when they “should” be buying. Scott Bessent’s Treasury Department has about $9 trillion worth of treasuries maturing over the next year. Those bonds and bills will need to be refinanced. If rates are high when these new treasury securities are issued, the government’s interest costs will soar even higher (already over $1 trillion/year). At some point, the Fed will have to get involved. Emergency rate cuts and eventually a massive new round of QE (money printing to buy treasuries) seem inevitable. Who else is going to buy $9 trillion worth of treasuries over the next year? Eventually the Fed may even have to begin “yield curve control”, which means pegging the yield on treasuries at artificially low levels. For example, during and after WW2, when the U.S. was heavily indebted, the Fed froze the 10-year yield at 2.5%, even as inflation raged as high as 14%. The goal was to dramatically lower U.S. debt-to-gdp levels by encouraging inflation and capping yields. Bond holders and savers got hosed. This is known as financial repression. And it could happen again. Yield curve control and financial repression are probably some years out. But I much prefer to keep the “safe” part of my portfolio in gold and silver instead of government bonds. The upside potential is far higher, and taxes can be deferred for decades (until you decide to sell). Gold and Silver: Just Getting Started Rick Rule famously says, “I don’t own gold because I think it’s going to $3,500. I own it because I’m afraid it’s going to $10,000.” This is an excellent way to look at our current situation. This move in gold, which just surpassed $3,200/oz, is a flashing warning signal. The global debt-based monetary system is on the verge of breaking down. And instead of rushing into treasuries as a safe haven, the world’s central banks are increasingly turning to gold. If you want an idea of just how high gold could potentially go, be sure to read Jim Rickards’ $27,000 Gold if you haven’t yet. This is not an arbitrary price target, but the result of Jim’s careful calculation. Of course, Jim doesn’t guarantee we get there, but it should give you an idea of what’s possible. My message here is that if you’re just now thinking about starting a position in gold, you’re not too late. Interest in precious metal miners is just now picking up. One of the largest gold miners, Newmont (NEM), which we highlighted as a buy last week at around $45, soared to $55 today. And don’t get me started about silver, which is still about 35% below its 2011 high of $49.50. Once we break through silver’s $35/oz level, it’ll be off to the races. I’m a buyer of silver here. And gold miners still haven’t caught up with the spot price of bullion, so I will look to add there on dips. The vast majority of investors still have almost no exposure to gold, silver, and miners. This will change over the coming years. My advice is to get positioned for the shift now. You are not too late.

Those bonds and bills will need to be refinanced. If rates are high when these new treasury securities are issued, the government’s interest costs will soar even higher (already over $1 trillion/year). At some point, the Fed will have to get involved. Emergency rate cuts and eventually a massive new round of QE (money printing to buy treasuries) seem inevitable. Who else is going to buy $9 trillion worth of treasuries over the next year? Eventually the Fed may even have to begin “yield curve control”, which means pegging the yield on treasuries at artificially low levels. For example, during and after WW2, when the U.S. was heavily indebted, the Fed froze the 10-year yield at 2.5%, even as inflation raged as high as 14%. The goal was to dramatically lower U.S. debt-to-gdp levels by encouraging inflation and capping yields. Bond holders and savers got hosed. This is known as financial repression. And it could happen again. Yield curve control and financial repression are probably some years out. But I much prefer to keep the “safe” part of my portfolio in gold and silver instead of government bonds. The upside potential is far higher, and taxes can be deferred for decades (until you decide to sell). Gold and Silver: Just Getting Started Rick Rule famously says, “I don’t own gold because I think it’s going to $3,500. I own it because I’m afraid it’s going to $10,000.” This is an excellent way to look at our current situation. This move in gold, which just surpassed $3,200/oz, is a flashing warning signal. The global debt-based monetary system is on the verge of breaking down. And instead of rushing into treasuries as a safe haven, the world’s central banks are increasingly turning to gold. If you want an idea of just how high gold could potentially go, be sure to read Jim Rickards’ $27,000 Gold if you haven’t yet. This is not an arbitrary price target, but the result of Jim’s careful calculation. Of course, Jim doesn’t guarantee we get there, but it should give you an idea of what’s possible. My message here is that if you’re just now thinking about starting a position in gold, you’re not too late. Interest in precious metal miners is just now picking up. One of the largest gold miners, Newmont (NEM), which we highlighted as a buy last week at around $45, soared to $55 today. And don’t get me started about silver, which is still about 35% below its 2011 high of $49.50. Once we break through silver’s $35/oz level, it’ll be off to the races. I’m a buyer of silver here. And gold miners still haven’t caught up with the spot price of bullion, so I will look to add there on dips. The vast majority of investors still have almost no exposure to gold, silver, and miners. This will change over the coming years. My advice is to get positioned for the shift now. You are not too late.

The global debt-based monetary system is on the verge of breaking down. And instead of rushing into treasuries as a safe haven, the world’s central banks are increasingly turning to gold. If you want an idea of just how high gold could potentially go, be sure to read Jim Rickards’ $27,000 Gold if you haven’t yet. This is not an arbitrary price target, but the result of Jim’s careful calculation. Of course, Jim doesn’t guarantee we get there, but it should give you an idea of what’s possible. My message here is that if you’re just now thinking about starting a position in gold, you’re not too late. Interest in precious metal miners is just now picking up. One of the largest gold miners, Newmont (NEM), which we highlighted as a buy last week at around $45, soared to $55 today. And don’t get me started about silver, which is still about 35% below its 2011 high of $49.50. Once we break through silver’s $35/oz level, it’ll be off to the races. I’m a buyer of silver here. And gold miners still haven’t caught up with the spot price of bullion, so I will look to add there on dips. The vast majority of investors still have almost no exposure to gold, silver, and miners. This will change over the coming years. My advice is to get positioned for the shift now. You are not too late.

Normally, risk in the equities markets drives dollars into Treasuries. The result is normally a downward move in interest rates. This is important because, for every basis point (0.01%) decrease in the interest rate, the cost of servicing the debt falls by $1 billion per day. Instead, because Congress can't control themselves and spending, money is flowing into precious metals. Not good, as those are not productive uses of capital. Solution: restore confidence in the dollar, which means Congress has got to stop bingeing on debt spending. Elon is doing that, but the GOP has failed miserably in educating the public what's going on. And to those idiots who thought a smaller gov't didn't mean firing public employees, grow up.

Solution: restore confidence in the dollar, which means Congress has got to stop bingeing on debt spending. Elon is doing that, but the GOP has failed miserably in educating the public what's going on. And to those idiots who thought a smaller gov't didn't mean firing public employees, grow up.

I own it because I’m afraid it’s going to $10,000.” This is an excellent way to look at our current situation. This move in gold, which just surpassed $3,200/oz, is a flashing warning signal. The global debt-based monetary system is on the verge of breaking down. And instead of rushing into treasuries as a safe haven, the world’s central banks are increasingly turning to gold. If you want an idea of just how high gold could potentially go, be sure to read Jim Rickards’ $27,000 Gold if you haven’t yet. This is not an arbitrary price target, but the result of Jim’s careful calculation. Of course, Jim doesn’t guarantee we get there, but it should give you an idea of what’s possible. My message here is that if you’re just now thinking about starting a position in gold, you’re not too late. Interest in precious metal miners is just now picking up. One of the largest gold miners, Newmont (NEM), which we highlighted as a buy last week at around $45, soared to $55 today. And don’t get me started about silver, which is still about 35% below its 2011 high of $49.50. Once we break through silver’s $35/oz level, it’ll be off to the races. I’m a buyer of silver here. And gold miners still haven’t caught up with the spot price of bullion, so I will look to add there on dips. The vast majority of investors still have almost no exposure to gold, silver, and miners. This will change over the coming years. My advice is to get positioned for the shift now. You are not too late.

If you want an idea of just how high gold could potentially go, be sure to read Jim Rickards’ $27,000 Gold if you haven’t yet. This is not an arbitrary price target, but the result of Jim’s careful calculation. Of course, Jim doesn’t guarantee we get there, but it should give you an idea of what’s possible. My message here is that if you’re just now thinking about starting a position in gold, you’re not too late. Interest in precious metal miners is just now picking up. One of the largest gold miners, Newmont (NEM), which we highlighted as a buy last week at around $45, soared to $55 today. And don’t get me started about silver, which is still about 35% below its 2011 high of $49.50. Once we break through silver’s $35/oz level, it’ll be off to the races. I’m a buyer of silver here. And gold miners still haven’t caught up with the spot price of bullion, so I will look to add there on dips. The vast majority of investors still have almost no exposure to gold, silver, and miners. This will change over the coming years. My advice is to get positioned for the shift now. You are not too late.

Pull up the legendary trader James Sinclair’s forecast from years ago….the “ Angels” way back when are back in full force….his Fibonacci number correlation shows where Gold is headed. Throw in Richard Russell’s legendary DOW Theory Letters affirms what is dead ahead. Cycles, a good read, but it was written in 2009….. https://www.gold-eagle.com/article/richard-russell-gold Many here are youngsters, learn from the past. The miners are still cheap. That’s where you’ll make the most fiat money. ————- Amen to that…..but choose very carefully, and be sure to trade some of the fiat winnings into real wealth. The miners are still cheap. That’s where you’ll make the most fiat money. ————- Amen to that…..but choose very carefully, and be sure to trade some of the fiat winnings into real wealth. The Federal Reserve can simply buy US government bonds paying 2% in sufficient quantity. There’s also the possibility of a value added tax. At 8%, it would bring in about $1.6 trillion a year. Peter Schiff knows who has gold in the ground vs the ones that say they do. Stocks are still more overvalued Agree they are a long term deal for the win. Exceptions do happen sometimes. Agree I wonder how much of the money that people got by selling stocks is just sitting at a brokerage as cash waiting for things to settle down. It’d be interesting to see the breakdown of where the money from the sale of stock went - cash, gold, foreign currencies, other assets. Maybe the US should not spend $1 trillion a year on the DoD. Fiber optic drones are fairly cheap and highly effective. The US has entered the dreaded Debt Death Spiral….it will run its course, slowly, but surely. After the “ burnout”, the “new” system will emerge hopefully based on equal weights and measures.

April 11, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against CrowdStrike on July 30, 2024 with a Class Period from November 29, 2023 to July 29, 2024. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of CrowdStrike have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike’s customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell nearly 10%, according to the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit.

The US has put Meta, Apple, Tesla, TikTok, and others in a tough spot. The US has put Meta, Apple, Tesla, TikTok, and others in a tough spot. by Alex Heath For a while, it looked like President Donald Trump was going to have Big Tech’s back. Now, the tech industry is collateral damage in his global trade war. On Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen floated the idea of placing “a levy on the advertising revenues of digital services” if tariff negotiations with the US go south. This would be the opposite outcome that tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg were hoping for when they threw their support behind the new administration. To someone like Zuckerberg, Trump was supposed to be the strong-armed leader to bring the overbearing EU to heel. Instead, the rhetoric between the US and EU is ratcheting up just weeks before the EU is already set to fine Meta (and Apple) for violating its Digital Markets Act. While certainly more of a self-inflicted wound, Elon Musk’s popularity in the US has “inverted as his support for President Trump has increased,” Nate Silver wrote this week. Tesla’s stock price, meanwhile. has lost over a third of its value this year, and, thanks to tariffs, the company has removed the option to buy new, US-made vehicles in China. As I predicted last week, TikTok is particularly screwed by Trump’s extra-aggressive China tariffs, which the country has promised to “fight to the end.” Even as it’s still business as usual for TikTok’s rank and file, the app’s fate in the US feels increasingly precarious. When asked this week about the extended deadline to reach a TikTok deal in the US, a spokesperson for China’s commerce ministry said the government “opposes practices that ignore the laws of the market economy, plunder by force, and damage the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises.” “There’s not going to be much dialogue until that’s resolved,” one of TikTok’s aspiring bidders, AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi, said this week of the tariffs. The situation is such a mess that the US stock market tanking also “drowned out the ability to infer feedback” from shareholders about AppLovin’s bid, Foroughi told Bloomberg. If anything, this week is a reminder that the tech industry has grown so large and influential that its leading companies are tools for leverage between countries. In times of relative peace, that influence can be beneficial for Big Tech. When things get hostile, Big Tech is put in the crosshairs.

Hoka’s popular sneakers consistently earn rave reviews from podiatrists, runners and folks who stand on their feet all day. And now’s a good time to find some of the brand’s styles on sale. We combed the internet to find more than a dozen Hoka deals on both women’s and men’s shoes—including designs that have earned spots in our sneaker shopping guides. For example the bestselling Hoka Clifton 9, which we named one of the best walking shoes for women, is 20% off right now. Freshen up your sneaker (and fitness) game for spring by snagging one of the best Hoka deals ... More happening now. Whether you’re a walker, runner or simply looking for a comfortable and colorful pair of sneakers, these are the best Hoka deals happening now. Just keep in mind that some discouns only apply to a select color or two, and these deals tend to go fast—so if you’re eyeing a fresh pair, don’t delay. Hoka The Hoka Clifton 9 is one of our gear editors’ favorite shoes for both walking and long days of standing. You can score the women’s Clifton 9 for 20% off in nine colors on Hoka’s site right now. Or browse Dick’s Sporting Goods and REI if you’re looking for a different size and color combo—it’s on sale for the same discount at all three stores. Hoka Sturdy and springy, this sneaker was recently updated with a bouncy foam midsole and ultralight design that make it ideal for everyday runs. This discount is available at Hoka in four colorways and at Zappos in five. Hoka Inspired by southern California’s Solimar beach, this sleek sneaker offers neutral stability, mid-level cushioning and an extended heel—perfect for daily training. Three colors are currently on sale, though the colorway pictured above has the most sizing available. Hoka If you want a sneaker that can transition from the pavement to the trails, this Challenger design is on sale in six colors direct from Hoka. The redesigned sneaker offers more height than its previous iteration, a plush midsole and a grippy lug tread to keep you from slipping when you’re off-road. Hoka Designed with professionals in mind, the Hoka Bondi SR is for people who spend most of the day on their feet, like restraunt workers and nurses. The shoe features a plush sole, water-resistant leather and a slip-resistant outsole. This discount is only available in the pictured colorway, but sizes 7.5 through 11 are in stock. Hoka This unique slip-on is unisex. It has a stretchy, full-knit upper that lets you comfortably wear the sneaker without socks and plush cushioning for extra support. You can shop this discount in three colors, but the white design pictured above has the widest array of sizes. Hoka If you’re new to running, we think the Hoka Clifton 9 design is a great beginner-friendly option. Despite its plush build, the Clifton 9 is lighter than previous Clifton iterations and employs Hoka’s “meta rocker” sole for a smoother heel-to-toe transition. This option is on sale in 15 colorways at Hoka and 20 at Zappos. Hoka The Bondi 8’s cushioned sole and supportive design are great for flat feet and anyone who suffers from plantar fasciitis. It’s currently on sale in seven colors direct from Hoka, but the pictured colorway has the most available sizing. Two neutral colors are also on sale at Dick’s Sporting Goods. Hoka Save 20% on the Hoka Mach 6 for men in three colorways directly from Hoka. This shoe is made for everyday runs on your treadmill or the road. It’s a neutral shoe with a bit of responsiveness to help you push off with the best stride possible. Hoka Like the women’s version above, this all-terrain sneaker was designed for runners who want to seamlessly transition between the road and the trails. It’s designed with a breathable mesh upper and a sturdy lug sole to keep you stable and comfortable. Hoka currently has six colors discounted, but sizing is limited in some options. Hoka Perfect for post-gym recovery or hanging out by the pool, these ORA slides are on sale in three colors right now. The chunky sole has a plush top layer that hugs the foot and a moisture-wicking jersey strap that was recently updated for a better fit. Zappos The Kawana is a great transitional sneaker that you can wear at the gym or running errands. It has a low-profile aesthetic, a breathable mesh upper and an internal bootie for a more secure fit. This discount is only available in the pictured colorway but it’s the best price you can find for this sneaker online. Hoka rarely offers sitewide sales. That said, its sale section is often stocked with older designs for 20% to 40% off. You can also typically find deals on Hoka sneakers from third-party retailers like REI and Dick’s Sporting Goods. Yes, select Hoka styles have been awarded the podiatric APMA Seal of Acceptance. This means podiatrists have reviewed the shoes and agreed that a number of Hoka’s cushioned designs are beneficial to overall foot health. Our editors named the Hoka Clifton 9 sneaker the best cushioned walking shoe for women and the best men’s walking shoe for flat feet. The style is plush and supportive without feeling overly bulky. But they won’t work for everyone—the best walking shoe for you depends on a variety of factors, including how high your arches are and how you walk. For instance, we recommend skipping the Hoka Clifton 9 if you have especially narrow feet. The brand recommends replacing your Hokas between 250 and 500 miles, depending on individual wear. Pay attention to signs like increased muscle fatigue, uneven wear patterns and discomfort to identify when it’s time to trade in an older pair. Hokas have been popularized online for their outstanding comfort and support. They have a super-plush midsole that helps with shock absorption and stability without weighing you down. They also come in a variety of bright color combinations to suit most styles and preferences.

Title: Bonds Break, Bullion Breaks Out
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/bonds-break-bullion-breaks-out/
Time Published: 2025-04-11T22:00:54Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedApril 11, 2025 Global markets have reached a day of reckoning. This has been decades in the making. Now, massive changes are sweeping the world. No, what we’re seeing in the markets is not “normal.” Instead, this is the: In short, you no longer have the luxury of relying on the old rules, the old way of thinking. It’s time for a new playbook. Since the early 1980s until recently, U.S. Treasury Bonds have been the perfect compliment to stocks. When stocks were doing poorly, bonds did well. And vice versa. Hence why the 60/40 (60% stocks, 40% bonds) was such a popular portfolio model. This relationship is breaking down. As U.S. stocks have been crashing, the value of bonds is also falling. This can be seen in the chart below, which shows the U.S. 10-year Treasury Bond yield (as the value of the bond falls, the yield rises). This chart shows the yield on the 10-year bond year-to-date. Source: CNBC See that big spike in yields over the last week? That’s a worrying sign. Investors are selling bonds when they “should” be buying. Scott Bessent’s Treasury Department has about $9 trillion worth of treasuries maturing over the next year. Those bonds and bills will need to be refinanced. If rates are high when these new treasury securities are issued, the government’s interest costs will soar even higher (already over $1 trillion/year). At some point, the Fed will have to get involved. Emergency rate cuts and eventually a massive new round of QE (money printing to buy treasuries) seem inevitable. Who else is going to buy $9 trillion worth of treasuries over the next year? Eventually the Fed may even have to begin “yield curve control”, which means pegging the yield on treasuries at artificially low levels. For example, during and after WW2, when the U.S. was heavily indebted, the Fed froze the 10-year yield at 2.5%, even as inflation raged as high as 14%. The goal was to dramatically lower U.S. debt-to-gdp levels by encouraging inflation and capping yields. Bond holders and savers got hosed. This is known as financial repression. And it could happen again. Yield curve control and financial repression are probably some years out. But I much prefer to keep the “safe” part of my portfolio in gold and silver instead of government bonds. The upside potential is far higher, and taxes can be deferred for decades (until you decide to sell). Rick Rule famously says, “I don’t own gold because I think it’s going to $3,500. I own it because I’m afraid it’s going to $10,000.” This is an excellent way to look at our current situation. This move in gold, which just surpassed $3,200/oz, is a flashing warning signal. The global debt-based monetary system is on the verge of breaking down. And instead of rushing into treasuries as a safe haven, the world’s central banks are increasingly turning to gold. If you want an idea of just how high gold could potentially go, be sure to read Jim Rickards’ $27,000 Gold if you haven’t yet. This is not an arbitrary price target, but the result of Jim’s careful calculation. Of course, Jim doesn’t guarantee we get there, but it should give you an idea of what’s possible. My message here is that if you’re just now thinking about starting a position in gold, you’re not too late. Interest in precious metal miners is just now picking up. One of the largest gold miners, Newmont (NEM), which we highlighted as a buy last week at around $45, soared to $55 today. And don’t get me started about silver, which is still about 35% below its 2011 high of $49.50. Once we break through silver’s $35/oz level, it’ll be off to the races. I’m a buyer of silver here. And gold miners still haven’t caught up with the spot price of bullion, so I will look to add there on dips. The vast majority of investors still have almost no exposure to gold, silver, and miners. This will change over the coming years. My advice is to get positioned for the shift now. You are not too late.

Title: Wall Street Rallies After Trump Says He Is ‘Open to Talks’ With China on Tariff Deal

Apple continues to rebound from the $1 trillion that was slashed from its market cap following the president’s new tariff plan Another day, another wild trading session, with all three major stock indexes jumping more than 1.50% on Friday. The strong close to a whiplash-inducing week comes after a few more twists in the ongoing U.S.-China tariff battle, with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt saying the Trump Administration was “open to talks” with China on trade deals. Leavitt’s comment came hours after China increased its tariff on American goods to 125% on Friday — a move that followed President Trump raising the tariff on Chinese imports from 104% to 125% to 145% this week. “We are doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY,” the president posted soon after the markets opened on Friday. “Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly. DJT.” The S&P 500 increased 1.81%, the Dow Jones climbed 1.56% and the Nasdaq jumped 2.06% on Friday. All three indexes are up more than 6% compared to where they started off on Monday, following brutal back-to-back days at close last week. Here is a look at how several prominent media and tech stocks performed: Meta: -0.50%Google: +2.59%Fox Corp.: -1.27%News Corp.: +2.34%Amazon: +2.01%Disney: -0.39%Comcast: +0.12%WBD: -1.60%Netflix: -0.31%Roku: +1.60%Snap Inc.: +1.66 Apple’s stock price, meanwhile, was up 4.06% to $198.15 per share. The world’s most valuable company had at one point this week seen $1 trillion shaved from its market cap following the president’s announcement of his “liberation day” tariffs on Apr. 2, but the company has climbed back in recent days. The company, led by CEO Tim Cook, is now down about $550 billion from where it was before the tariff plan, closing the week with a valuation of $3 trillion. Investors have been spooked because Apple assembles iPhones and a number of other products in China; the company recently flew in planes full of devices to avoid being hit by the new tariff on Chinese imports. Friday’s trading action was a fitting close to a rollercoaster week for the markets. Wall Street took a big hit on Thursday, one day after a historic rally on Wednesday, following President Trump’s announcement he was pausing his reciprocal tariff plan for 90 days on most countries so that deals could be made. Another important development on Friday was the Federal Reserve being “absolutely” ready to step in to help stabilize skittish markets, if necessary. The president and his team of financial advisors have said a stiff tariff on China is warranted, considering the country’s communist government rips off American businesses and their IP. President Trump has also said it is not great that a foreign adversary produces so many of the goods that are shipped into the States. “Hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,” Trump said on Wednesday. The U.S.-China trade standoff has caused a ripple effect that has been felt across virtually every industry, including Hollywood. The China Film Administration on Thursday said it would “moderately reduce” the number of American films it shows moving forward. When it comes to how this will shake out, one Disney executive told TheWrap “We’re not panicking. We are waiting and seeing.”

Additionally, Neutron’s only contract was secured at a discount with an unreliable partner. The lawsuit further claims that on February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report titled "Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time," alleging that Rocket Lab had misled investors about the likelihood of a mid-2025 Neutron launch.

Title: American Express Stock Gets an Upgrade on View It Would be Resilient in a Recession

Analysts from Bank of America on Friday upgraded American Express (AXP) stock to a "buy" rating, saying the credit card provider should be resilient through a potential downturn or recession. They upgraded the stock, but cut their price target to $274 from $325 to reflect lowered revenue and earnings forecasts as they expect consumer spending to slow. Bank of America is now one of six "buy" ratings among the 13 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, along with five "hold" and two "sell" ratings, while its price target is now below the $308.67 consensus. The stock was up 2% at $252 in late trading Friday. "The macro environment is uncertain and GDP growth is likely slowing," the analysts wrote. "This is a headwind for revenue growth. But we think Amex's high-quality customer base should drive more durable earnings while keeping credit losses in-check." American Express shares have lost about 15% since the start of the year, which the analysts said "offers long-term oriented investors an opportunity to buy a high-quality company at a reasonable valuation." The analysts noted that in prior downturns like the COVID pandemic and the first Trump administration's trade war, American Express stock "outperformed not only other card issuers but also the S&P 500." The card issuer is set to report first-quarter earnings on Thursday, and Bank of America analysts said the company's outlook for the rest of 2025 will likely be more important than whether its first-quarter results beat or miss estimates. American Express reported results in line with estimates last quarter as executives said spending was strong through the holiday season.

("Merck" or the "Company") (NYSE: MRK) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). Merck investors have until April 14, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: lesley@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. According to the complaint, the defendants provided investors with material information regarding Merck’s projected $11 billion in revenue from Gardasil sales by 2030. Their statements expressed confidence in Merck’s ability to drive demand through consumer activation and education efforts, emphasizing the benefits of Gardasil and targeting eligible populations for vaccination. As a result, they issued optimistic reports and forecasts about Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced that it would no longer meet its long-forecasted $11 billion in Gardasil sales by 2030. The company revealed it would halt shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants attributed this decision to an overinflation of channel inventories, citing that demand in China had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this announcement, Merck’s common stock plummeted. After closing at $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, the stock price dropped to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025—a decline of more than 9% in just one day.

Title: Pokemon Card Shortages Are Pushing Up Prices Where You Least Expect It

Time Published: 2025-04-11T18:54:25Z

It’s not just online resellers who have shockingly high Pokemon TCG prices these days. By Amanda Kay Oaks The Pokemon TCG hobby is in a difficult spot this year thanks to card shortages on not just popular sets like Scarlet & Violet – Prismatic Evolutions, but almost anything you might expect to see on your local store’s shelves. Indeed, fully stocked shelves of Pokemon cards have become a rare sight. Because cards are harder to come by, reseller prices for many sets and individual cards have skyrocketed as scalpers try to capitalize on the market. However, the difficulty of keeping Pokemon cards in stock is impacting prices outside of reseller markets like eBay, as well. Many retailers have been selling Pokemon TCG items for slightly above the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail price, commonly known as MSRP. For instance, the upcoming Prismatic Evolutions restocks at GameStop are priced at roughly $10 more than MSRP. That’s a bit of a jump, but it’s nothing compared to what many resellers are trying to get for unopened items from the Prismatic Evolutions set. The Elite Trainer Box, for instance, has an MSRP of $49.99, is listed at GameStop for $59.99, and can be found on TCG Player with asking prices around $136.99. Clearly, buying from resellers is not going to be your best value. But one place many gamers do expect to see a fair price is at their local game store. Whereas many Pokemon TCG fans don’t have a particularly personal connection with big box stores that carry Pokemon cards, such as Target or Costco, many collectors do have a more friendly relationship with their local card shop. These independent sellers are often community gathering places as well as stores, hosting events for a variety of TCGs, including Pokemon, but also Magic: The Gathering and beyond. This means many TCG fans have come to expect fair pricing and even good deals from their local card shops. But the pressure in the market is being felt by smaller stores perhaps more than anywhere else, and it’s starting to show. Running a small business like a local card shop means working with narrow profit margins, especially when the overall economy is looking uncertain. That sometimes means making difficult choices, including marking up stock for hard-to-come-by items like Pokemon TCG cards. Lately, some Pokemon card collectors have noticed surprisingly high prices at their local stores, leading to even more frustration around the current state of the hobby. One fan reports that their local card store’s pre-order prices for the upcoming Destined Rivals set were marked up 50% over MSRP. This is a larger markup than most Pokemon TCG fans are used to seeing, especially at their local shops. While it could certainly be an attempt to increase profit on a popular item, these price increases are often a result of the increased cost local stores pay to get the items in stock. With shortages continuing, distributors often charge more for these hot-ticket items, which in turn means local stores need to either charge more or take a smaller profit themselves. And it’s not just new sets like Destined Rivals that are falling victim to price increases, either. One Reddit user reports seeing the Scarlet & Violet – 151 booster bundle at their store for nearly $200! For context, that same box is set at $26.94 at the Pokemon Center, though of course, it’s currently sold out. So, it’s quite an impressive markup, but one that may feel necessary given the current challenges of keeping Pokemon TCG cards in stock. At this price, it’s hardly going to fly off the shelves, but with the scarcity mindset, someone may well pay the price. Although it looks like a good number of local stores are marking up their Pokemon TCG items more than they used to, this increasing trend doesn’t mean every store is charging well above MSRP. Many fans report their local shops are still keeping prices in reasonable ranges despite the scarcity. So, it’s certainly still worth stopping by your local store when looking for Pokemon cards. Hopefully, as The Pokemon Company reprints some of the most popular sets, more fans, and the local stores they buy from, will be able to get Pokemon cards at reasonable prices again. Until then, we’ll keep relying on luck and good timing to find that pack opening feeling. Have you seen outrageously high prices on Pokemon cards recently? Let us know in the comments below!

April 11, 2025 13:28 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP APP Investors with Losses Encouraged to Contact the Firm SAN FRANCISCO, April 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

The Information, a US tech media outlet, first reported this development on Friday, citing a person with direct knowledge of the situation. This decision is part of a broader restructuring initiative that started last year, when Google consolidated its Android and Chrome teams into the Pixel and Devices group, headed by Rick Osterloh. At the time of the merger, the newly formed unit employed over 20,000 people. A Google spokesperson confirmed the layoffs in a statement to The Information. “Since combining the platforms and devices teams last year, we’ve focused on becoming more nimble and operating more effectively, and this included making some job reductions in addition to the voluntary exit program that we offered in January.” Related News Google rolls out Gemini 2.5 Pro for complex AI tasks Google to buy cybersecurity company Wiz for $32bn Google announces transition from assistant to Gemini by year-end This new round of layoffs follows Google’s decision in February to extend buyout offers to employees in its ‘People Operations’ division, also known as Human Resources.

Title: Despite Zuckerberg’s Promises, Facebook ‘Fact Checkers’ Continue Censoring Information About COVID-19 Vaccines
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/facebook-continue-censoring-information-covid-19-vaccines/5884230
Time Published: 2025-04-11T15:41:45Z
Full Content:
In early January 2025 Meta announced that it would be scrapping the use of its so-called ‘independent fact checkers’ on Facebook and Instagram, replacing them with a ‘community notes’ system similar to that now used on Elon Musk’s X platform. Commenting on the move, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg admitted that the ‘fact checkers’ used by the firm had been “too politically biased” and that it was “time to get back to our roots around free expression.” Three months later, however, it appears not much has changed. Facebook posts made by users outside the United States remain subject to draconian censorship by anonymous ‘fact checkers.’ Having previously fallen foul of the Facebook censorship regime, we launched our new Dr. Rath Health Foundation page on the social media platform last month. Everything appeared to be fine until we posted a link to an article on our website describing how a June 2024 study authored by researchers from the Netherlands had analyzed data from 47 countries and found that over three million excess deaths have occurred in the Western World since 2020. Published in the prestigious BMJ Public Health journal, the study described this as “unprecedented” and, expressing serious concerns, urged governments to thoroughly investigate the underlying causes – including potential COVID-19 vaccine harms. Facebook’s response was not what we were expecting. Our post was quickly slapped with a ‘False information’ ‘Reviewed by third-party fact-checkers’ label. This was accompanied by a link to a webpage claiming that COVID-19 vaccines had supposedly actually lowered excess deaths. Reading further we learned that Facebook pages and websites “that repeatedly share false information will see their distribution reduced and their ability to advertise removed.” So much for Zuckerberg’s promises, then. Unusually, the study concerned had been widely reported in the legacy media. The UK’s Daily Telegraph newspaper even went so far as to openly state that COVID-19 vaccines may have helped fuel the rise in excess deaths, and that experts were calling for more research into side effects and possible links to mortality rates. Other legacy media covering the story included the New York Post, the Times of India, Bahrain’s Gulf Daily News, and the UK’s Daily Mail. Nevertheless, despite the BMJ Public Health journal having peer-reviewed the study prior to publication, it responded to the media coverage by saying that its ‘integrity team’ and editors were now “investigating issues raised regarding the quality and messaging” of the research. It isn’t difficult to guess what this means. Behind the scenes, in activities resembling those of the infamous ‘Ministry of Truth’ in George Orwell’s ‘Nineteen Eighty-Four,’ the paper is likely being watered down or considered for retraction. By labeling posts about the study as ‘false information,’ Facebook is essentially supporting such moves. Speaking in January 2025, acknowledging that there had been “too much censorship,” Zuckerberg committed himself to “restoring free expression” on Meta’s platforms. Getting rid of the ‘fact checkers’ and replacing them with a ‘community notes’ approach would start in the United States, he said. After that, the claimed plan – as described on the Facebook website – is to improve it over the course of the year before expanding to other countries. While we would like to believe that Zuckerberg is genuine, there are no published dates as to when the ‘community notes’ system will be expanded to countries outside of the United States. Nor are there even any guarantees that it will be expanded. Prohibitions on freedom of speech are not simply a matter of human rights. They are also a direct threat to our health. The coming months will show us where Zuckerberg really stands. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Title: UBS: Taiwan’s Surging Exports Imply A Data Center Revenue Of $42 Billion For NVIDIA’s April-Ending Quarter
URL: https://wccftech.com/ubs-taiwan-surging-exports-imply-a-data-center-revenue-of-42-billion-for-nvidia-april-ending-quarter/
Time Published: 2025-04-11T15:32:43Z
Full Content:
This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. With President Trump's global trade war rapidly morphing into a tit-for-tat tariff-related one-upmanship between the US and China, NVIDIA is now finding itself at the very center of this maelstrom, replete with opportunities and challenges that such a strategic position almost always entails. We got a glimpse of NVIDIA's elevated negotiating power recently when it was able to win an unfettered exemption from the Trump administration to continue selling AI-critical H20 GPUs in China. Now, UBS is out with a fresh note that leverages Taiwan's surging exports - presumably boosted by tariff-related pull-ins - to quantify the upside for NVIDIA's data center sales in the April-ending quarter. To wit, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri notes that Taiwan's exports of Automatic Data Processing (ADP) equipment ex laptops clocked-in at $12.03 billion for March 2025, corresponding to a month-over-month (MoM) growth of 20.6 percent relative to February's export figure of $9.97 billion. Arcuri points out that March is historically the strongest export month for Taiwan, typically recording MoM growth of mid-20 percent over February's figures. This means that Taiwan's export figures for March were a tad weaker than what historical analogs would imply. The UBS analyst, however, takes pains to note that Taiwan just witnessed its "strongest February in over a decade (+14% M/M relative to -15% historical seasonality)." The analyst then asserts: "Assuming April constitutes a "normal" 36% of total F1Q (Apr Q) would imply ~$34B of exports - a large step-up of ~58% Q/Q - although it is unclear to what extent this reflects tariff pull-ins rather than underlying strength." Basically, if Taiwan's April exports follow their historical pattern, the country would likely record a quarter-over-quarter export growth of 58 percent. According to Arcuri, this level of exports would imply an 18 percent quarter-over-quarter growth in NVIDIA's data center revenues: "We model NVDA's data center revenue up 18% Q/Q to $42B in Apr Q." While the UBS analyst cautions that Taiwan's export data has not been predictive of NVIDIA's data center sales for the past few quarters, his overall thesis is bolstered by TSMC recently reporting "above-seasonality" sales for March 2025. Of course, this comes as Citi has just lowered its total GPU sales forecast for NVIDIA by 3 percent for the ongoing CY 2025, and 5 percent for the CY 2026, citing "mostly lower Microsoft capex concerns and higher risk of pause in enterprise investments amid uncertainty around the global economy due to ongoing trade war." Meanwhile, Lynx Equity believes that NVIDIA, "with its AI servers sourcing most components outside the US and assembled by system integrators based in Taiwan, has built a multi-layered strategy to avoid nearly all US tariffs." Moreover, the research house believes that China is unlikely to subject NVIDIA to punitive tariffs, "given China’s continued dependence on NVDA products." Accordingly, Lynx Equity now expects NVIDIA to promptly return to its recent highs. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Wall Street Inches Higher Even as China Ups Its Tariff on American Goods to 125%

“We are doing really well on our tariff policy,” President Trump insists as media and tech stocks open Friday to mixed results After what has felt like a weeklong rollercoaster ride for most investors, Wall Street was off to a relatively tame Friday morning, with the three major indexes all modestly moving higher in early trading. The green morning comes after wild back-to-back days on Wall Street and after China raised its tariff on U.S. goods to 125% earlier on Friday. Still, President Trump showed confidence that the ongoing tariff battle with China — and the tariff negotiations with several other countries — was going to turn out OK in a Truth Social post soon after markets opened. “We are doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY,” the president posted. “Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly. DJT.” His post comes the day after Wall Street took a big hit — which itself followed a historic rally on Wednesday, following President Trump’s announcement he was pausing his “liberation day” reciprocal tariff plan for 90 days so that countries could work out trade deals with the U.S. A half hour into trading on Friday, the S&P 500 was up 0.10%, the Dow Jones was up 0.04%, and the Nasdaq was up 0.14%. Here’s how a number of tech and media stocks are performing: Meta: -1.01%Google: +1.97% Fox Corp.: -0.59%News Corp.: +0.90%Amazon: +0.28%Comcast: +0.56%WBD: -3.40%Netflix: +1.66%Roku: -0.10%Snap Inc.: +0.32% Apple’s stock price was up 0.76% to $191.87 per share. The world’s most valuable company has had about $700 billion shaved from its market cap since the president announced his new tariff plan on Apr. 2. Investors have been spooked because Apple assembles iPhones and a number of other products in China; the company recently flew in planes full of devices to avoid being hit by the new tariff on Chinese imports. President Trump on Thursday raised the tariff on China to 145%. It will be worth seeing if any trade deals are announced on Friday — something that could give investors a bit more clarity heading into the weekend, compared to a week ago. President Trump on Thursday said he believes “we will be able to work out something that’s good for both countries” when discussing China. Check back after 4:00 p.m. ET to see how the day went for Wall Street.

Title: Google lays off hundreds from Platform and Devices division

Google reportedly laid off hundreds of employees from its Platforms and Devices division. The details come from The Information (via Engadget), which notes that Google said it would lay off employees earlier this year. The search giant offered buyouts in January as part of a “voluntary exit plan.” The Platforms and Devices division employs over 25,000 people. It handles Google’s Pixel devices, Nest products, and software like Android, ChromeOS, and Chrome. The division was formed roughly one year ago when Google merged its Platforms and Ecosystems unit and Devices and Services under senior vice president Rick Osterloh. A Google spokesperson told The Information that after combining the units last year, the company “focused on becoming more nimble and operating more effectively,” which included job reductions and the voluntary exit program. Google isn’t the only tech company laying off employees. Per data gathered by tech-focused job board TrueUp, tech companies have laid off over 45,000 people so far this year and nearly 240,000 employees in 2024. So far this year, we’ve seen layoffs from Microsoft, HP, Block, Meta, Amazon (which impacted workers in Quebec), and more. Source: The Information Via: Engadget

Title: The 12 Best AI Video Generators for Your Business to Try
URL: https://www.webfx.com/blog/marketing/best-ai-video-generators/
Time Published: 2025-04-11T14:18:02Z

AI is all the rage these days. That’s not totally surprising — it’s a revolutionary leap in technology, from text generation to image creation. It hasn’t taken long for them to start entering the video space, too. Several companies have successfully developed tools that allow them to generate lifelike videos using AI, and marketers are taking an interest in harnessing the best AI video generators for their campaigns. If you’re among the businesses interested in this phenomenon, you might be wondering which AI video tool would be the best one to try out. If so, you’re on the right page. Below, we’ll cover the best AI video generation tools out there, along with some pros and cons of using them! P.S. Want more marketing insights from the experts? Subscribe to Revenue Weekly — our email newsletter — to get more helpful marketing info delivered straight to your inbox! Now that we’ve covered some of the most important things to think about when considering AI video generation tools, let’s talk about what those tools are. There are many options out there, but we’ve selected five of the best tools for you to consider. Those tools include: Price: 14-day free trial available, with paid plans starting at $19+ per month Best for: Quickly turning long-form content like blogs and webinars into short, shareable videos The first AI video generator tool on our list is Pictory. Pictory is one of the most widely used AI video generators out there. It offers different options for creating videos, but its core process is pretty simple. Basically, you upload a video script, and Pictory will put together a video based on the text in the script. It will do this by analyzing the words in the script and then sticking together a bunch of stock footage that relates to the words it finds. You can also add AI-generated voice narration over the video. Price: Free limited plan available, with paid plans starting at $18+ per month Best for: Creating professional-looking AI avatar videos with multilingual voiceovers. Synthesia starts out the same as Pictory — it has you input a text-based video script, and then it generates a video. But instead of throwing together stock footage, it uses an AI avatar, having that avatar read the script. These avatars are based on real people. You can either upload footage of real employees at your company and have Synthesia create avatars from them, or you can choose from a variety of premade avatars provided by the software. These avatars look fairly lifelike, though there’s definitely an element of the uncanny valley there. Price: Free limited plan available, with paid plans starting at $28+ per month (free plan available) Best for: Fast, template-driven video creation for marketers and social media managers. InVideo is yet another platform that lets you input text and generate a video based on it. You can also choose from a variety of different video templates, so you still have a degree of control over the look of your video. InVideo is particularly convenient for creating social media videos, since it lets you export to platforms like Facebook and Instagram directly from the tool. You can even input your target audience, and InVideo will tailor the video to that group of people. Price: Free plan available, with paid plans starting at $20+ per month Best for: Hyper-realistic AI voiceovers and avatars tailored to e-learning and explainer videos. Another of the best AI video generators is Synthesys. Don’t get this mixed up with Synthesia — despite the similar names, they’re different tools. However, they do offer similar features. Like Synthesia, Synthesys specializes in producing AI avatars who can read the scripts you provide. These avatars aren’t limited to speaking in English, by the way (even if the people they’re based on are!). You can provide a script in anything from Spanish to Japanese to Dutch, and Synthesis will be able to handle it — it advertises that it supports over 140 languages. Price: Free plan available, with paid plans startig at $24+ per month Best for: Generating news-style AI avatar videos with ultra-fast turnaround times. Next, we have Deepbrain AI. This AI video generator tool, like Synthesis and Synthesia, allows you to submit a video script and have it read by an AI avatar. Deepbrain doesn’t really come with any features that you won’t find in other tools on this list, but it’s another option if for some reason you’re not interested in using the ones listed above. In terms of pricing, it’s cheaper than Synthesis, but more expensive than the other three tools listed here. Price: $0.50 per second of video Best for: Cinematic, story-driven video generation with advanced camera movement and scene consistency. Google Veo 2 is Google’s advanced, AI-powered video creation platform. You can use this video generator to convert text to video for marketing, social media, company trainings, and more. If you want to make more artful videos, this tool is a great option. Veo 2 supports advanced cinematic features, like camera direction and shot framing, allowing you to create masterpieces for any project. Price: Included in Amazon Bedrock pricing plan Best for: Creating long-form, coherent AI videos with consistent visual storytelling. Amazon Nova was launched early 2025 as part of Amazon’s suite of AI tools. With Nova, you can create videos for your Amazon products, as well as custom images from text. Nova maintains visual consistency and style across scenes up to two minutes long. If you’re looking for a seamless, e-commerce focused platform, Nova can be a great choice. Price: Free Best for: Multimodal, personalized video generation combining image, video, and audio inputs. Meta Movie Gen allows Meta users to create visual elements for branded and personal use. As of April 2025, this tool is free to use for Meta users, meaning it’s a great option if you are familiar with Meta platforms. This generator goes beyond video — you can integrate video, image, and audio generation for personalized brand storytelling. Price: Free plan available, with paid plans starting at $9.99+ per month Best for: Generating immersive 3D video scenes directly from text prompts. Luma Dream Machine offers a unique approach to video creation. This tool converts your custom text prompts into dynamic, 3D-rendered videos for personal or business use. If you want to explore a new art style for your business or start adding interest to your website, this tool is an affordable, accessible option. Price: Free plan available, with paid plans starting at $25+ per month Best for: User-friendly, fast-turnaround video generation ideal for creators and entrepreneurs. Nex ton our list is Pollo AI, an emerging tool that has been noted as a user-friendly, impressive option for video creation. This tool enables drag-and-drop editing and real-time preview in a beginner-focused interface. If you are new to AI, video generation, or want sometime easy to use for one-off projects, Pollo AI might be your new best friend. Price: Free basic plan available, with paid plans starting at $8 per month Best for: Short-form, creative content, like music videos and stylized animations. Pika Labs is gaining popularity for intuitive interface and ability to produce engaging short-form videos efficiently. It allows direct animation of characters and scenes from text and image inputs, making it easy to add your branded language, colors, and mascots to personalized videos. Price: Free basic plan available, with paid plans starting at $12+ per month Best for: High-fidelity AI video generation with fine-grained control over motion and style. Finally, we have Runway Gen-3 Alpha, a leading-edge video generation platform known for its high-quality, cinematic outputs. Since it’s release, it has become widely recognized for pushing the boundaries of AI-generated video content. This tool offers precise motion and style control for frame-accurate, cinematic outputs. And, with the low price point, you can start creating videos and gaining traction online for your business without breaking your budget. Before you choose an AI video generator tool, it can be helpful to know the benefits and downsides to using one in your marketing campaigns. On the positive side of using AI video software, you have: Despite those benefits, there are some definite downsides to using AI video generators. For one thing, even the best AI-generated videos still ring false for many viewers — something will always feel slightly off. That makes your content feel less authentic and trustworthy. On top of that, AI avatars aren’t great at expressing personality. Their bodily movements are extremely limited, as are their facial expressions, so they can’t show off personality with expressive faces or hand movements. That makes it a lot harder to connect with viewers. Finally, if you use software-provided avatars, there’s a good chance you’ll end up using the same avatars as other companies that use that software. After all, there are a limited number of avatars in each tool. Some users could have an immediate, negative reaction to your content if you use an avatar they’ve already seen from other companies. Regardless of whether you choose to use any AI video generation tools, you’ll need to put in the work to ensure that your videos are optimized to drive leads and conversions. If you’re not sure how to do that, you’ll need to get help from a professional marketing agency. WebFX is the perfect agency to help you through your video optimization process.

Title: Stocks tick back up as trade tensions deepen and big banks report earnings

U.S. stocks rose sharply Friday afternoon to close out a historically turbulent week, as investors absorbed rising trade tensions, falling consumer confidence numbers, and a wave of major bank earnings. After a turbulent Thursday that saw major U.S. market indexes sink sharply, the Dow Jones Industrial Average concluded the day up 619 points, or about 1.5%. The S&P 500 added 1.8%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose almost 2.1%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM-0.63%) finished Friday up 4% after the bank reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings and revenue. BlackRock (BLK+2.04%) gained 2.6% following its own earnings beat, while Morgan Stanley (MS+1.48%) shares rose 1.4% following strong performance across its major business lines. Wells Fargo (WFC+1.74%) slipped almost 1%, underperforming its peers. Big Tech names also posted gains. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+1.23%) ended up 2.6%, Microsoft (MSFT+0.24%) gained 1.9%, and Apple (AAPL+2.21%) rose 4.1%. The gains suggested that while concerns over tariffs and political volatility remain top of mind, corporate results — especially from key financial players — are offering some reassurance to investors as earnings season kicks off. However, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that the economy is facing “considerable turbulence,” highlighting risks from “sticky inflation,” high fiscal deficits, elevated asset prices, and escalating “tariffs and ‘trade wars.’” He pointed to analysts’ revised earnings estimates for the S&P 500 as a possible sign of pain to come. Appearing on CNBC (CMCSA+1.99%) Friday, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink echoed Dimon’s sentiments, saying that he expects a “slowdown” across the board and that the U.S. may be in a recession soon — if it isn’t already. And U.S. consumers are growing deeply uneasy. According to preliminary data released Friday by the University of Michigan, consumer sentiment has declined 11% since March. This marks the fourth consecutive monthly decline and a 30% decrease since December 2024. Overnight, China announced a steep escalation in its trade retaliation, raising tariffs on U.S. imports from 84% to 125%. Chinese officials said the new rates effectively render U.S. goods uncompetitive — and that any further tariff increases from Washington would be treated as economically irrelevant. Meanwhile, gold surged to a record high above $3,200 an ounce as the bond selloff resumed and investors fled U.S. assets. Long-dated Treasury yields spiked again, signaling persistent fears over inflation and policy volatility. The U.S. dollar also slid, with the ICE Dollar Index down more than 1% to its lowest level in nearly three years. Deutsche Bank (DB+3.61%) analysts quoted by the New York Times cited the “radical vision and volatile policy” of the Trump administration as a major reason for the depreciation of key U.S. assets. Consumer-facing companies are also beginning to warn of downstream effects. Amazon (AMZN-1.08%) CEO Andy Jassy said the newly announced tariffs are already prompting third-party sellers to raise prices and consumers to stockpile. While Amazon is trying to soften the blow by stockpiling inventory and renegotiating with suppliers, Jassy acknowledged inflationary pressures are likely to ripple through. Meanwhile, the political climate may be adding its own chill. JPMorgan Chase strategist Michael Cembalest revealed this week that he has begun softening his public commentary on tariffs, citing the tense environment and recent executive orders targeting firms and individuals associated with Trump-era investigations. Other analysts are speaking out, however, with Wedbush releasing a memo Friday morning that didn’t mince words. “The economic tariff Armageddon unleashed by Trump last week has been the dark black cloud over stocks since this fiasco began and so far it’s been a Wall Street/stock driven event...that is all about to change over the coming days and weeks for U.S. consumers and businesses with the China 145% tariff now in place,” the memo said. “The self-inflicted uncertainty from the China tariffs has turned the corporate capital expenditures world upside down, created mass uncertainty not seen since Covid, created a price shock that will impact the daily lives of U.S. consumers with no end in sight, and unfortunately ripped the hearts and lungs out of the U.S. Big Tech supply chain in the process with no minimal to no alternatives.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: What's Wrong With APPLE?

Time Published: 2025-04-11T11:52:37Z
Full Content:
Even before President Trump’s tariffs threatened to upend Apple’s manufacturing business in China, the company’s struggle to make new products was leading some people inside its lavish Silicon Valley headquarters to wonder whether the company had somehow lost its magic. The tariffs, which were introduced April 2, caused Apple to lose $773 billion in market capitalization in four days and briefly lose its standing as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. But investors had already started to sour on the company, sending its share price down 8 percent in the first four months of the year, double the S&P 500’s decline. Apple had hoped to revive its fortunes over the past year with a virtual reality headset, the Vision Pro, and an artificial intelligence system called Apple Intelligence. Sales of the headset have been a disappointment, however, and the signature features of the A.I. system have been postponed because it didn’t work as well as the company had expected. The company’s issues underscored how its reputation for innovation, once considered a fundamental element of its brand, has become an albatross, fueling angst among employees and frustration among customers. And company insiders worry that Apple, despite its years of gravity-defying profits, is hamstrung by the political infighting, penny pinching and talent drain that often bedevil large companies, according to more than a dozen former and current employees and advisers. Apple declined to comment. It has been a decade since the releases of Apple’s most recent commercial successes: the Apple Watch and AirPods. Its services like Apple TV+ and Fitness+, which it introduced in 2019, lag behind rivals in subscriptions. Half of its sales still come from the iPhone, an 18-year-old product that is incrementally improved nearly every year. While Vision Pro sales have been disappointing, Apple’s issues with Apple Intelligence exposed dysfunction inside the organization. In a nearly two-hour video presentation last summer, Apple demonstrated how the A.I. product would summarize notifications and offer writing tools to improve emails and messages. It also revealed an improved Siri virtual assistant that could combine information on a phone, like a message about someone’s travel itinerary, with information on the web, like a flight arrival time. The A.I. features were unavailable when new iPhones shipped. They arrived in October, about a month late, and quickly ran into trouble. Notification summaries misrepresented news reports, leading Apple to disable that feature. Then, last month, the company postponed the spring release of an improved Siri because internal testing found that it was inaccurate on nearly a third of requests, said three people familiar with the project who spoke on the condition of anonymity. After the delay, Craig Federighi, Apple’s software chief, told employees that the company would reshuffle its executives, removing responsibility for developing the new Siri from John Giannandrea, the company’s head of A.I., and giving it to Mike Rockwell, the head of its Vision Pro headset. “Apple needs to understand what happened because this is bigger than just rearranging the deck chairs,” said Michael Gartenberg, a technology analyst who previously worked as a product marketer at Apple. “If ever there’s been an example of over-promising and under-delivering, it’s Apple Intelligence.” It was the first time in years that Apple hadn’t shipped a product it had unveiled. Some details of Apple’s changes to its Siri team and challenges were previously reported by Bloomberg and The Information. The A.I. stumble was set in motion in early 2023. Mr. Giannandrea, who was overseeing the effort, sought approval from the company’s chief executive, Tim Cook, to buy more A.I. chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, five people with knowledge of the request said. The chips, which can perform hundreds of computations at the same time, are critical to building the neural networks of A.I. systems, like chatbots, that can answer questions or write software code. At the time, Apple’s data centers had about 50,000 GPUs that were more than five years old — far fewer than the hundreds of thousands of chips being bought at the time by A.I. leaders like Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, these people said. Mr. Cook approved a plan to double the team’s chip budget, but Apple’s finance chief, Luca Maestri, reduced the increase to less than half that, the people said. Mr. Maestri encouraged the team to make the chips they had more efficient. The lack of GPUs meant the team developing A.I. systems had to negotiate for data center computing power from its providers like Google and Amazon, two of the people said. The leading chips made by Nvidia were in such demand that Apple used alternative chips made by Google for some of its A.I. development. At the same time, leaders at two of Apple’s software teams were battling over who would spearhead the rollout of Siri’s new abilities, three people who worked on the effort said. Robby Walker, who oversaw Siri, and Sebastien Marineau-Mes, a senior executive with the software team, struggled over who would have responsibility for some aspects of the project. Both ended up with pieces of the project. The infighting followed a broader exodus of talent from Apple. In 2019, Jony Ive, the company’s chief designer, left to start his own design firm and poached more than a dozen integral Apple designers and engineers. And Dan Riccio, the company’s longtime head of product design who worked on the Apple Watch, retired last year. In their place, Apple has been left with old and new leaders with less product development experience. Mr. Giannandrea, who joined the company in 2019 from Google, had never led the launch of a high-profile product like the improved Siri. And Mr. Federighi, his counterpart overseeing software, had never led the creation of a new operating system like some of his predecessors in that role. Mr. Cook, 64, who has a background in operations, has been hesitant over the years to provide clear and direct guidance on product development, said three people familiar with the way the company operates. “It’s clearly a breakdown of leadership and communication and internal processes,” said Benedict Evans, an independent analyst who previously worked as a venture capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz. Apple hasn’t canceled its revamped Siri. The company plans to release a virtual assistant in the fall capable of doing things like editing and sending a photo to a friend on request, three people with knowledge of its plans said. Some of Apple’s leaders don’t think the delay is a problem because none of Apple’s rivals, like Google and Meta, have figured out A.I. yet, these people said. They believe there’s time to get it right. As the clock ticks on fixing Siri, Apple will be defending the assistant’s current shortcomings. Last month, customers filed a federal lawsuit accusing Apple of false advertising. Since then, its commercials about Siri have gone dark. Brian X. Chen contributed reporting. Tripp Mickle reports on Apple and Silicon Valley for The Times and is based in San Francisco. His focus on Apple includes product launches, manufacturing issues and political challenges. He also writes about trends across the tech industry, including layoffs, generative A.I. and robot taxis. The post What’s Wrong With Apple? appeared first on New York Times. Copyright © 2023.

Title: Time To Buy Shopify Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHINA - 2025/02/13: In this photo illustration, a Shopify logo is displayed on the screen of a ... More smartphone. (Photo Illustration by Sheldon Cooper/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Shopify (NASDAQ: SHOP) enables businesses to build online storefronts and sell directly to consumers. Its notable clients include Skullcandy, Daily Harvest, and Carrier. Shopify’s stock has dropped 20% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 is down 10%, amid a broader market downturn. Despite this, Shopify’s financial performance remains strong, with Q4 2024 revenue rising 31% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $2.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings increasing 29% y-o-y to $0.44 per diluted share. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue are at their lowest since Shopify’s 2015 IPO, and the Q4 take rate improved by 12 basis points. Gross merchandise volume increased 24% to $94.5 billion. Shopify's subscription-based revenue model, driven by contract and transaction fees, creates a consistent income stream. Furthermore, its use of AI improves customer experience and helps drive retention, supporting long-term growth. Shopify’s stock seems like a good pick at around $85. Still, while there is little immediate cause for concern with SHOP stock, its high valuation makes it susceptible to negative developments. This conclusion is based on comparing Shopify’s valuation with its operational performance in recent years and its financial standing. Our analysis across Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience reveals a very strong operating profile. For those seeking returns with reduced volatility, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio offers a compelling alternative — having outperformed the S&P 500 with over 91% returns since inception. When assessing value per dollar of sales or earnings, SHOP stock appears highly overvalued relative to the overall market. • Shopify's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 13.3, compared to 3.2 for the S&P 500 • Its price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 109.9, versus 24.3 for the S&P 500 • Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 58.5, compared to 24.3 for the benchmark Shopify’s Revenues have seen substantial growth in recent years. • Over the last 3 years, Shopify's revenue has grown at an average rate of 24.4% (vs. 6.3% for the S&P 500) • Revenue rose 25.8% from $7.1 billion to $8.9 billion in the past 12 months (vs. 5.2% for the S&P 500) • In the most recent quarter, revenue rose 31.2% to $2.8 billion from $2.1 billion a year earlier (vs. 5.0% for the S&P 500) Shopify’s margins are around the median of the companies Trefis covers. • Shopify’s Operating Income over the past four quarters was $1.1 billion, giving it a moderate operating margin of 12.1% (vs. 13.0% for the S&P 500) • Shopify’s Operating Cash Flow was $1.6 billion, with a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 18.2% (vs. 15.7% for the S&P 500) Shopify’s balance sheet appears very strong. • With $1.1 billion in debt and a market cap of $118 billion (as of 4/9/2025), Shopify’s Debt-to-Equity Ratio is 1.0%(vs. 19.0% for the S&P 500). [Lower is better] • Cash and equivalents of $5.5 billion out of $14 billion in total assets result in a Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 39.3% (vs. 14.8% for the S&P 500) SHOP stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during major market pullbacks. • SHOP stock dropped 84.8% from $169.06 (Nov 19, 2021) to $25.67 (Oct 11, 2022), while the S&P 500 fell 25.4% • The stock has not yet recovered to its pre-crisis high • The post-crisis high is $129.31 on Feb 18, 2025, with the stock now trading near $85 • SHOP stock fell 40.7% from $54.32 (Feb 19, 2020) to $32.23 (Mar 16, 2020), while the S&P 500 fell 33.9% • The stock fully recovered by Apr 17, 2020 Shopify’s overall performance across the evaluated metrics is summarized below: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Neutral • Financial Stability: Extremely Strong • Downturn Resilience: Very Weak • Overall: Very Strong Despite its very high valuation, SHOP stock appears appealing yet volatile. If you’re not comfortable with the volatility of SHOP stock, consider the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio. This strategy, blending large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks, has outperformed its benchmark (a combination of S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 indices), offering a more adaptive approach to changing market conditions, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 11 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software.

The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade.

It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not.

Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 11 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States?

Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 11 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers.

Title: Blue State Blues: The Case for a ‘Christmas Truce’ in China Trade War
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/04/11/blue-state-blues-the-case-for-a-christmas-truce-in-china-trade-war/
Time Published: 2025-04-11T10:07:07Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump claimed a big win this past Wednesday when he convinced some 75 countries to negotiate on trade and tariffs, leaving China out in the cold. In doing so, he also avoided a bond market disaster. But we are not be out of the woods yet. Thousands of American businesses, and potentially millions of employees, are still on the front lines of the trade war with China — a war that took many by surprise. The risks of that confrontation threaten the entire U.S. economy. That is not to minimize what the Trump administration achieved this week, after the president took on all comers in a global trade confrontation, like Bruce Lee in a kung fu movie. In doing so, Trump goaded China into taking a hard line that cut it off, not just from U.S. markets but, potentially, from an entire American trading bloc. Whether Trump had gamed out every exact move, or simply found a path by applying constant pressure, it worked. China has been a disruptive player in global markets ever since it was admitted to the World Trade Organization 25 years ago, without having reformed its internal politics since the horrors of Tiananmen Square. But the U.S. and others believed that trade would make China’s political system more democratic, as it made China’s economy more free. And American companies wanted access to the vast Chinese market, and China’s labor force. At first, trade between China and the rest of the world was mutually beneficial. Many U.S. firms set up production facilities in China, while Hollywood found a large new audience for its cultural products. American consumers benefited from lower prices, and China’s middle class began to flourish. But then China started outcompeting its trading parters. Around the world, for example, textile factories began shutting down, unable to match low Chinese labor costs. China also stole the intellectual property of western firms. It insisted that they share their knowledge as a condition of doing business in the country — then set up Chinese firms that outcompeted the foreign ones. China also kept labor costs artificially low, in some industries, by using exploitative labor practices — or, in the case of the Uighur Muslims, slave labor. Some U.S. companies began pulling out of China; others saw no real alternative to operating there. Meanwhile, China held a growing amount of American public debt, giving it leverage over the U.S. Instead of China becoming more like America, the U.S. became more like China. Movie studios shaped their content to avoid offending Chinese audiences. Social media companies began helping the government censor its critics. And during the coronavirus pandemic — which began in China — U.S. authorities shut down the economy; some shut own basic rghts. The Wall Street Journal’s William Galston, the paper’s only left-of-center columnist, observed that much of the anxiety over globalization was not a function of trade itself but of the unique challenge that China posed. Conventional economic rules did not seem to apply to a trading partner that had the power to distort markets on its own. Admitted into a “free trade” system, China has tried to manipulate the rules to dominate trade for its own enrichment and power. Trump is the first president to have perceived that China is both a partner and a rival, perhaps even an enemy. He launched, and won, a trade war with China in his first term, and began a process of “decoupling” from China, especially after the coronavirus. That process might have continued, had Trump not lost to Joe Biden in 2020 — a president with corrupt business ties to China, through his son, Hunter — a story the media worked hard to suppress when it emerged. Trump has returned — four years, and trillions of dollars in American public debt, later — and he has adopted a more aggressive strategy to counter China. That includes controlling key points on global trade routes — Greenland, the Panama canal, Gaza (near the Suez Canal), the Cape of Good Hope — and launching the ongoing trade war, which has led China to retaliate, even as other U.S. trading partners sought opportunities for negotiation and compromise. We will have to wait for the history books and the insider accounts to learn how much of the last week was clever calculation, and how much was blunder and luck. But it seems likely that Trump’s ultimate goal was, consciously, to divide the world into trading blocs and ask our trading partners to make a choice: either the authoritarian, communist regime of China; or the democratic, free market system of the United States, flawed and messy though it may be. That strategy is well on its way. But it has also left thousands of American entrepreneurs, and potentially millions of workers, in the lurch. Giant companies like Apple can move production from China to India. For anything smaller, the tariffs are absolutely devastating — whether little mom-and-pop stores selling imported goods, small manufacturers using Chinese components in American factories, or gutsy inventors looking to scale up production beyond their garages. I spoke to an old friend from my Chicago days, Rick Woldenberg, this week. His toy company, Learning Resources, makes educational products that you may recognize from your childhood or your children’s schools. When the China tariffs, and counter-tariffs, hit this week, he was forced to pause production and shipping throughout his entire U.S.-China operation. His tax bill went up 50 times — yes, five-zero — from $2.3 million to $100.2 million, overnight. At a 20% tariff, Rick says, American companies like his got the message: move production out of China. At a 145% tariff, Rick says, the message is: “Die.” Rick’s company is a family business that has been around for a century. It employs 500 people, many in the Midwest. It had, until now, been in solid financial shape. Now, Rick told me, he faces going out of business. And he warned that if he faces that risk, then thousands of other companies doing business in China, who may have less flexibility than his, could be making similar choices. A “contagion effect” may be imminent: a cascade of layoffs and closures. With more than a hint of bitterness, he says he was doing fine before President Trump decided toe “fix” things. He understands the larger economic and strategic issues at stake, but his first responsibility is to his customers, his 500 employees, and his family legacy — a legacy of manufacturing, most of it in America. Rick has a suggestion: as long as we are pausing the implementation of tariffs on everyone else for 90 days, why not pause the tariffs for China as well? At least for long enough for his company to shift production, long enough to produce Christmas orders and put them on the water by July. Christmas, he notes, might be very cold indeed if the goods on which retailers depend fail to arrive in American ports. And we won’t be able to make them domestically yet. Perhaps this is all part of the plan — the anticipated cost of the trade war that may, in fact, have been inevitable, whether Trump decided to take a stand right now or leave the task to someone else. But if there is any way to mitigate that cost, it could provide Trump with the political cover he will need to fight this war to victory. A “Christmas truce” — extending the 90-day pause to tariffs on China, to fill Christmas orders — could be a timely, essential respite. Joel B.

More for the app for Chinese AI company DeepSeek alongside the logo for the ChatGPT app on January 29, 2025 in Bath, England. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images) Question: Why would someone pay 30 times earnings for Microsoft stock (NASDAQ: MSFT) when Nvidia stock is available at 33 times earnings? It may not seem logical, especially when considering these three key factors: Although Nvidia may appear to be a “safe haven,” its historical performance during market disruptions suggests caution. During the 2022 inflation shock, NVDA plunged over 65%. In 2020, amid pandemic-driven uncertainty, the stock declined more than 35%. Most notably, it lost 85% of its value during the 2008–2009 financial crisis. So, NVDA doesn’t exactly qualify as a safe stock. Our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? offers detailed insights into how Nvidia has performed during and after past market crashes. Still, Nvidia’s stock has already corrected meaningfully, dropping from nearly $150 earlier this year to under $110 currently. Investors seeking a potentially more resilient alternative may want to explore the Trefis High Quality portfolio, a strategy that has returned more than 91% since inception, as shown by its HQ performance metrics. For investors who believe in the long-term growth of Artificial Intelligence, Nvidia could be a compelling choice at its current valuation. The company holds a crucial position as an “arms supplier” in the AI revolution. Investing in Nvidia is effectively backing the infrastructure that powers AI development across major companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon. As the AI boom is still in its early phases, companies continue to invest heavily in supporting infrastructure. For instance, Meta’s projected capital expenditures for tech infrastructure stand at around $65 billion—illustrating the magnitude of ongoing AI investments. Despite its attractive potential, Nvidia carries risks that should not be overlooked. Earnings may fall short of projections, and growth could decelerate from the current 50% rate to a more modest 30%, especially if firms begin conserving cash. There’s also a possibility that Nvidia’s clients will prioritize building more efficient AI models, reducing their need for an ever-expanding volume of chips. Moreover, unexpected developments can adversely affect the stock. Investors should be aware of the potential for a 40% drop in share price under adverse conditions. However, selling amid such a downturn could undermine long-term investment goals. Despite these headwinds, long-term investors with a 3–5 year horizon who are comfortable with market volatility may find Nvidia attractive at current levels. For those interested in strategies designed to navigate downturns, the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio has consistently outperformed a blended benchmark of all-cap stocks, including the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Alternatively, investors could consider consulting with an advisor experienced in bear market strategies. Staying calm and strategic during turbulent markets can lead to significant long-term gains.

That said, we like a lot about Netflix, especially right now. Ramp-up of Live TV and sports is one. We explain the positives and negatives below. Netflix is scheduled to release its Q1 2025 earnings on Thursday, April 17, 2025. According to consensus estimates, revenue is expected to rise by approximately 12% to around $10.5 billion, while earnings per share are projected to be about $5.73. This growth is anticipated to be fueled by Netflix’s robust subscriber additions throughout 2024—totaling over 40 million—and its recent price increases. In January, the company raised the standard HD plan by $2.50 to $18 per month and increased the Premium plan to $25 per month. Netflix posted strong subscriber gains in 2024, driven by its crackdown on password-sharing and the growth of its ad-supported tier. However, this momentum could ease in 2025. Additionally, intensifying competition could contribute to elevated churn or slower growth in new subscriptions. Netflix’s decision to discontinue reporting subscriber figures might indicate that it expects growth to taper off this year. Margins will also be a key focus this quarter. The company’s content expenses are set to climb as it expands further into live sports programming, including NFL games and WWE wrestling, which are typically higher-cost content segments. Netflix currently holds a market capitalization of $404 billion. Over the past twelve months, the company generated $39 billion in revenue, with $10 billion in operating profit and $8.7 billion in net income.

Title: Bitcoin’s Recent Drawdown Proves Its More Than Just a Leveraged Tech Play

The U.S. dollar index (DXY) has fallen below 100 and gold has surged to new all-time highs as escalating tariffs have heightened global economic uncertainty. Consequently, asset prices have taken a hit—most notably in the tech sector and cryptocurrencies. Since reaching its all-time high of $109,000 in January, bitcoin (BTC) has declined approximately 26%. When compared to the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, bitcoin’s drawdown sits right in the middle, signaling its growing maturity as an asset. Tesla (TSLA) is currently the worst performer, down nearly 50% from its peak. NVIDIA (NVDA) follows with a 31% drop. Apple (AAPL), Bitcoin, Meta (META), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) have all declined around 26%, while Microsoft (MSFT) stands out with a relatively modest 18% drawdown. To highlight bitcoin’s resilience in this current 3-month correction, is to compare it to a similar period during its 2021 downturn—from November 2021 to February 2022—when it plummeted 45% from $69,000 to $38,000. At that time, bitcoin was the worst performer among major tech names, though Tesla also suffered significantly. This comparison underscores how bitcoin has grown more resilient over time as its market cycles progress and the asset continues to mature.

April 10, 2025 20:00 ET | Source: Kirby McInerney LLP Kirby McInerney LLP NEW YORK, April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Kirby McInerney LLP reminds investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of those who acquired Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:RKLB) securities during the period from November 12, 2024, through February 25, 2025 (“the Class Period”). Investors have until April 28, 2025, to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. [LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CLASS ACTION] On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Rocket Lab’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, the price of Rocket Lab shares declined by $2.21 per share, from $22.49 per share on February 24, 2025, to close at $20.28 on February 25, 2025. The complaint alleges that defendants, throughout the Class Period, failed to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; and (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner.
