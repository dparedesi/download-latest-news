NEW YORK - Within the span of a month, Wall Streetâs biggest banks have quit what had been one of the most popular clubs inside global finance. The Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a group dedicated to helping lenders reduce their carbon footprint, has in quick succession been abandoned by Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America (BofA) and Morgan Stanley. JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, looks to be next.Â The moves reflect US banksâ desire to shield themselves from increasing political pressure as Donald Trump returns to the White House, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. And NZBA is bracing itself for more US exits, secretariat lead Sarah Kemmitt told members in a Dec 31 letter seen by Bloomberg. She cited the âpolitical environmentâ.Â At the same time, the real-world impact of the NZBA defections is unclear. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, banks have collectively stepped up their financing of the fossil fuel industry since the alliance was formed in 2021. Membership of NZBA was likely more a case of âvirtue signallingâ than âmeaningful climate impactsâ, said business law professor Jill Fisch from the University of Pennsylvania.Â A spokesperson for NZBA declined to comment.Â Activists are now demanding that the government intervene to target Wall Street. Environmental Advocates NY, a non-profit, says it is urging New York state officials to introduce regulations and laws that would compel banks operating in the worldâs biggest financial hub to take climate action.Â The wave of NZBA exits follows behind-the-scenes tensions that have been brewing for more than two years. In 2022, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were among banks pushing back against binding targets on climate finance. NZBA then watered down some requirements, and members stayed put. But as the Republican Party grows more hostile towards climate-friendly organisations, the finance industry is repositioning itself. Global temperatures are rising fast, yet banks continue to reap short-term profits by sticking with fossil fuel producers. It is therefore both âdistressing and unsurprisingâ that Wall Street is turning its back on net-zero alliances, saidÂ Professor Ken Pucker, who teaches sustainability at the Fletcher School at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts.Â The alliances were created in order to encourage the finance industry to take into account the longer-term cost of supporting oil, gas and coal.Â Back in 2021, when NZBA was formed, banks now leaving the alliance proudly touted their membership. BofA chief executive Brian Moynihan spoke of a âcommitment to net zeroâ in his role as co-chair of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, whose stated mission is to âbuild a coordinated global effortâ to help green the private sector.Â And in an April 2021 statement announcing its agenda, the worldâs biggest coalition for climate finance â the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (Gfanz) â said it would ârequire signatories to set science-aligned interim and long-term goals to reach net zero no later than 2050â. Gfanz ended 2024 by recalibrating its mission as banks flee and GOP (Republican Party) attacks intensify. The group is distancing itself from the net-zero alliances for which it had previously been an umbrella organisation. Going forward, Gfanz will make its guidance available to financial firms, whether they have committed to a net-zero alliance or not. A spokesperson for Gfanz declined to comment beyond the groupâs public statements. Banks that sign up to NZBA still commit to transition their financed emissions to align with âpathways to net zero by 2050â at the latest, according to its website. They are also required to provide 2030 targets to show they are on track, and to document their progress.Â All banks exiting NZBA have made public statements to say they still recognise decarbonisation as a worthy goal. But they have also made clear that their biggest duty is to serve the needs of their clients. None has provided an official reason for quitting the alliance.Â Wall Street is now navigating a world in which bankers and money managers suspected of being unsupportive of the GOPâs pro-fossil fuel agenda face a growing threat of litigation.Â Just weeks after Trump was re-elected in November, Texas led a move to sue BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street for allegedly breaching antitrust laws by adopting pro-climate strategies to suppress coal production. Then in December, the GOP-led House Judiciary Committee said it found âsubstantial evidence that a climate cartel of financial institutionsâ had engaged in âanti-competitive collusionâ by demanding that companies âdisclose, reduce and enforceâ their net-zero climate commitments. The committee, which is led by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, singled out Gfanz and similar groups for leading what it described as a climate crusade.Â GOP members have made clear they feel increasingly emboldened. After hearing of the defections from NZBA, Republican Congressman-elect Riley Moore of West Virginia said via a spokesperson that he will keep trying to ban and block financial firms suspected of supporting âanti-fossil fuel ESG (environmental, social and governance) policiesâ. Meanwhile, Wall Street firms continue to earn considerably more from arranging fossil-fuel deals than their European counterparts. In 2024, JPMorgan topped the league table of banks underwriting bonds and loans for oil, gas and coal companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was followed by Wells Fargo, TD Securities, BofA, RBC Capital Markets and Citigroup. The biggest underwriter of green bonds, meanwhile, was BNP Paribas, which is the largest bank in the European Union. European banks, which are subject to much stricter climate regulations than their US peers, have so far showed no sign of walking away from NZBA. And representatives of lenders with headquarters spanning London to Amsterdam to Frankfurt said they plan to stay put. âOur position is very straightforward, we have absolutely no intention of leaving the NZBA,â a spokesperson for Standard Chartered told Bloomberg. ING Groep and Deutsche Bank have made similar statements. Global banks provided about US$680 billion (S$931.6 billion) worth of fossil fuel loans and bond deals in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That is up from US$667 billion in 2021, when NZBA was created. Banks that have stepped up such deals over the period include BofA and Goldman, the data shows. Prof Pucker of Tufts University draws parallels between the choices banks are making today, and those they made in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis. He says to understand banksâ thinking now, it is worth recalling a 2007 comment by Mr Charles O. Prince III, who was Citigroupâs chief executive at the time: ââAs long as the music is playing, youâve got to get up and danceâ.â Global warming is now on track to race past the critical threshold of 1.5 deg C, raising questions as to the value of having financial firms claim they can still align their operations with that target. Environmental Advocates NY says the state government must now consider forcing banks to impose financing limits to align with climate goals, including restrictions targeting fossil fuels. It is also calling for rules that would require banks to document the extent to which they are lowering their so-called financed emissions. Ms Vanessa Fajans-Turner, executive director at the non-profit, said it is clear Republicans have succeeded in their efforts to get Wall Street to retreat from climate commitments, âmodestâ as they were. âThe banks wonât police themselves,â she said. âThatâs why we need regulation.âÂ BLOOMBERG Find out more about climate change and how it could affect you on theÂ ST microsite hereÂ .

Title: The Monster Behind Weather Engineering?

Time Published: 2025-01-05T02:32:25Z

“Climate instability” is a soft term, for climate geoengineering, weather modification, extended into weather weaponizing. In other words, a crime on humanity. Professor Michel Chossudovsky provides the historic and technical details concerning weather warfare that has been emerging slowly since WW II, and probably before. For certain, whenever you hear “fake news” to comments and reports about geoengineering and weather weaponizing, you can be sure the so-called fake news are actually the truth. And this is the case for most everything else called “fake news”. However, what tops it all, is the recent discovery through a former employee at the South Pole Station in Antarctica. He says, what he saw at the South Pole Station is “HAARP on steroids”. He became a whistleblower, who testified before the United States Senate. HAARP stands for High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program. Since 2015, it is officially a University of Alaska Fairbanks project which researches the ionosphere – the highest, ionized part of Earth’s atmosphere. In reality, it has a long history of weather modification and climate geoengineering. The researcher and whistleblower, Eric Hecker, used to work for Raytheon Technologies Corporation, an American multinational aerospace and defense conglomerate, at the South Pole Station. In a 15-minute interview by Redacted, he reveals the existence of a MASSIVE weather machine at the South Pole Station. The interview, which details what Mr. Hecker experienced at the South Pole Station, is mind-blowing. It “makes the HAARP project look like a baby project.” The weather machines at the South Poles Station can control earthquakes and the weather, alias climate. They can fabricate and direct earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones just about anywhere in the world. In addition, there is a giant UFO control tower, also called a neutrino control tower. Neutrinos are tiny subatomic particles, often called ‘ghost particles’ because they barely interact with anything else. Neutrinos can be used as high-frequency energy transmitters. Earthquake or storm forming energy can be beamed literally anywhere in the world. Mr. Hecker talks about precisely targeted earthquakes and storms. See and listen to this earth-shaking interview by Redacted of 11 October 2024. With this prelude, the recent category 3 to 5 devastating hurricanes hitting North Carolina and Florida, as well as the typhoons Bebinca and Yagi, hitting China and other Asian countries, are easily explained. In late September, Hurricane Helene, a category 5 Hurricane, hit five US States, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, killing way over 300 people. Hurricane Helene was a near-record-breaking storm. Winds and rainfall together turned the tornado into an almost unimaginable disaster that stretched more than 800 kilometers inland from the Florida coast. “Helene” devastated and flooded Asheville, North Caroline. Strangely, Asheville sits on billions worth of lithium. Asheville counts about 100,000 inhabitants and is on about 700m elevation – it is unusual that such elevations are flooded to the extent Asheville was inundated (see picture by Asheville Free Press). Two companies, Piedmont Lithium and Albemarle Corp., plan to open lithium mines in the State of North Carolina in the coming years. Lithium is a metal used to power batteries for electric vehicles, smartphones, and laptop computers – and, of course, “war electronics”. Guess who controls both of these companies? Right – BlackRock and Vanguard. See the incisive analysis and video of Greg Reese Click here to watch Greg Reese’s video Click here to watch Greese’s video Last Wednesday night, 9 October, another weird, record Hurricane “Milton” hit the Florida coast, close to Siesta Key near Tampa, moving inwards towards Mexico, devastating Tampa, Florida, killing at least 23 people. The hurricane was downgraded from an original maximum strength category 5 to a level 3 when it made landfall, and later further down to a category 1 storm. According to the utility tracker “Find Energy”, some 1.3 million customers were still without electricity on Saturday throughout Florida. See the report by CBS No surprise, Bill Gates owns much of Tampa’s inner city’s renaissance landmark $3.5 billion Water Street Tampa project. Co-investor is Jeffrey Vinik (owner of the city’s professional hockey team, the Tampa Bay Lightning). The 55-acre mixed-use development project at the heart of the city’s downtown corridor recently received the title as North America’s first WELL: Certified Community, thanks to its sustainability and livability standards. That seems to fit perfectly into the UN Agenda 2030. The Water Street Tampa project redefines a booming downtown area, taking advantage of the city’s prime waterfront setting. See this. It is said that Bill Gates intends on making Tampa a 15-minute city. While fool proof the evidence is scanty, what looks like targeted storms, raises many questions. Geoengineering and weather manipulation is on the mind of ever more people. Keeping the narrative of “conspiracy theory” alive, is ever more difficult. People are waking up. They are connecting the dots between the crisscrossed chemtrails skies, extreme hurricanes, and unpredictable severe weather variations, from cold to hot, to rain, to sunny, foggy, hail – an unusual and unhealthy mix. And now, with the interview by Redacted with Eric Hecker, even destructive killer-earthquakes are no longer mysteries. Here is what is said about Hurricane Helene – with the potential multi-billion dollars lithium mining in the Asheville, NC, region: see video below. See also this and this and this. * As to Hurricane “Milton”, Paul Craig Roberts notices that it evolved in such an unusual way that it didn’t seem real. See this. The following 14 minute-video provides a history of the amazing ability to intensify and radically change the path of hurricanes. Concluding, weaponizing weather and climate, makes nuclear war superfluous. “Weather” and earthquakes can be targeted to specific areas as in war. Also, avoiding nuclear wars avoids nuclear radiation and nuclear fallouts that can last from a few decades to thousands of years, and may affect the commandeering elite, as much as the common plebs. What We, the People, want to avoid is nuclear war and weaponized weather and / or climate. We do not want wars of any kind.

‘It’s a lousy thing to do,’ say crime victims. ‘But I feel sad for them – karma is real’ Dominique Van Oosten and Fiona McMurray with their cat Daisy. Photo: Frank McGrath Burglars who stole Christmas presents from under the tree of a Co Wicklow home will suffer “karma”, while the affected families have been left “overwhelmed” by the outpouring of love and support from their local community. On December 20, burglars entered the home of Dominique Van Oosten and Fiona McMurray in Bray, Co Wicklow. The South African women and close friends share a home together in the seaside town alongside their two daughters, who are both young adults. When they were all out on December 20, burglars entered their home and helped themselves to wrapped Christmas presents under the tree. The “opportunistic” thieves did not steal anything else from the house. The women believe that, as neither of their cars were in the driveway, the burglars spotted the gifts visible from the window. They gained entry to the house through the side gate and then the back door, which was unlocked. To whoever you are, I am so sorry that you felt the need to do this Among the gifts stolen was a child’s Minecraft watch, a perfume for an elderly relative that is no longer being produced and a number of specially selected gifts purchased by both women on a recent trip to Rotterdam. The monetary value of the gifts amounted to around €400, the women explained, but it wasn’t about the money. “Most of these gifts were irreplaceable. It’s not about the cost, it was really a shock that a person or persons would come in and steal presents from under our Christmas tree. "To whoever you are, I am so sorry that you felt the need to do this — please know that karma is a real thing,” Ms Van Oosten said. In the aftermath, friends and neighbours of the two women rallied around them to offer support. “The positives have been phenomenal. The empathy and community spirit here in Bray and even further has just been unbelievable and we really appreciate it,” Ms McMurray added. “A woman who lives in Blackrock had a spare bottle of the perfume that was stolen from me — it belonged to her own late mother — and she dropped it out to us. It has blown us away how kind people can be.” It has been a bit triggering for our daughters Other neighbours and friends dropped in packages of Christmas treats and gifts. The mothers said their two daughters have been affected by the invasion of their home, with neither wanting to stay alone in their Bray home at the moment. “It is difficult, when someone comes into your own space. We come from South Africa, which is a far more dangerous country than Ireland, so it has been a bit triggering for our daughters. But they will be all right. "We are putting better security measures in place now, including cameras. Our message to people is that you can never be too aware of security in your home because burglars can be very opportunistic. “We love the community here in Bray and feel very much a part of it, now more than ever. We would like to thank everyone for their kindness. Our Christmas was not ruined and no one was hurt,” Ms Van Oosten added. Asked about their feelings towards the thieves, both the women said they feel sorry for them. “What they did, it feels mean. It’s a lousy thing to do. But I do feel sad for them too. It won’t sit comfortably with them. Karma is real.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 15 Energy Infrastructure Stocks That Are Skyrocketing. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Solaris Energy Infrastructure, Inc. (NYSE:SEI) stands against other energy infrastructure stocks that are skyrocketing. In January 2024, the Biden administration paused federal authorizations for several pending LNG export projects, citing concerns about environmental impacts and domestic energy security. The US Department of Energy later released an assessment indicating that increased LNG exports could add 1.5 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions annually by 2050, equivalent to a quarter of the current emissions of the US. However, President-elect Donald Trump is set to reverse the Biden administration’s pause on liquefied natural gas (LNG) export approvals, marking a significant shift in US energy policy. On January 1, Ukraine officially halted the transit of Russian natural gas to several European nations, marking the end of a five-year agreement and closing a chapter in Russia’s decades-long dominance over Europe’s energy markets. The termination of this deal comes amidst the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, with neither side willing to negotiate an extension. Europe is expected to rely heavily on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports. Christoph Halser of Rystad Energy estimates that the EU will need to source approximately 7.2 billion cubic meters of gas from the global LNG market. READ ALSO: 10 Best Low Priced Stocks to Invest in Now and 11 Best Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy Now. As Europe pivots away from Russian gas, the United States emerges as a key player in filling the supply gap. US LNG exports to Europe have already been rising in recent years, and this shift presents an even greater opportunity for American energy producers. With robust infrastructure and increased LNG export capacity, the U.S. is well-positioned to strengthen its role as a reliable supplier to Europe, enhancing energy security across the continent while bolstering its own energy industry. The growth of US energy exports hinges on significant investments in infrastructure. According to a report by ICF, prepared for the American Petroleum Institute (API), the development of US oil and gas infrastructure is expected to remain robust through 2035. The report highlights that the primary drivers for continued infrastructure development remain strong. Shale and tight oil resource extraction are projected to continue at a rapid pace, supported by advancements in extraction technologies and favorable market responses to competitive commodity prices. Total capital expenditures (CAPEX) for oil and gas infrastructure are projected to range between $1.06 trillion and $1.34 trillion from 2017 to 2035. This equates to an average annual investment of $56 billion to $71 billion, spanning various infrastructure components, including surface and lease equipment, gathering and processing facilities, pipelines for oil, gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs), storage facilities, refineries, and export terminals. As global energy dynamics shift, the United States stands poised to play a pivotal role in ensuring energy security for Europe while driving growth in its own energy sector.

(NYSE:SEI), headquartered in Houston, Texas, specializes in providing critical infrastructure for energy production, storage, and transportation. The company operates assets spanning natural gas pipelines, storage facilities, and energy logistics hubs. Solaris Energy Infrastructure, Inc.’s (NYSE:SEI) clients include energy producers, industrial facilities, and power generation companies. In a strategic move to diversify its revenue streams, Solaris Energy Infrastructure, Inc. (NYSE:SEI) acquired Mobile Energy Rentals (MER), a distributed power business, in September 2024. This acquisition marked a significant milestone in the company’s growth trajectory, as it enabled Solaris Energy Infrastructure, Inc. (NYSE:SEI) to enter the rapidly growing market for behind-the-meter power solutions. The demand for behind-the-meter power solutions is being driven by the growing need for reliable and efficient energy supply, particularly in the data center and oilfield sectors. Solaris Energy Infrastructure, Inc.’s (NYSE:SEI) stock price has increased significantly, driven by the company’s strategic acquisition of Mobile Energy Rentals and its successful integration into the business. The acquisition has not only expanded the company’s service offerings but also enhanced its growth prospects, leading to increased investor confidence. The company’s strong financial performance, including revenue growth and expanding margins, has also contributed to the appreciation of its stock price. Overall, SEI ranks first on our list of energy infrastructure stocks that are skyrocketing. While we acknowledge the potential of SEI to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 15 Energy Infrastructure Stocks That Are Skyrocketing. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Excelerate Energy, Inc. (NYSE:EE) stands against other energy infrastructure stocks that are skyrocketing. In January 2024, the Biden administration paused federal authorizations for several pending LNG export projects, citing concerns about environmental impacts and domestic energy security. The US Department of Energy later released an assessment indicating that increased LNG exports could add 1.5 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions annually by 2050, equivalent to a quarter of the current emissions of the US. However, President-elect Donald Trump is set to reverse the Biden administration’s pause on liquefied natural gas (LNG) export approvals, marking a significant shift in US energy policy. On January 1, Ukraine officially halted the transit of Russian natural gas to several European nations, marking the end of a five-year agreement and closing a chapter in Russia’s decades-long dominance over Europe’s energy markets. The termination of this deal comes amidst the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, with neither side willing to negotiate an extension. Europe is expected to rely heavily on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports. Christoph Halser of Rystad Energy estimates that the EU will need to source approximately 7.2 billion cubic meters of gas from the global LNG market.

As Europe pivots away from Russian gas, the United States emerges as a key player in filling the supply gap. US LNG exports to Europe have already been rising in recent years, and this shift presents an even greater opportunity for American energy producers. With robust infrastructure and increased LNG export capacity, the U.S. is well-positioned to strengthen its role as a reliable supplier to Europe, enhancing energy security across the continent while bolstering its own energy industry. The growth of US energy exports hinges on significant investments in infrastructure. According to a report by ICF, prepared for the American Petroleum Institute (API), the development of US oil and gas infrastructure is expected to remain robust through 2035. The report highlights that the primary drivers for continued infrastructure development remain strong. Shale and tight oil resource extraction are projected to continue at a rapid pace, supported by advancements in extraction technologies and favorable market responses to competitive commodity prices. Total capital expenditures (CAPEX) for oil and gas infrastructure are projected to range between $1.06 trillion and $1.34 trillion from 2017 to 2035. This equates to an average annual investment of $56 billion to $71 billion, spanning various infrastructure components, including surface and lease equipment, gathering and processing facilities, pipelines for oil, gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs), storage facilities, refineries, and export terminals. As global energy dynamics shift, the United States stands poised to play a pivotal role in ensuring energy security for Europe while driving growth in its own energy sector. A bird's eye view of a natural gas pipeline stretching across the landscape. To compile our list of the 15 energy infrastructure stocks that are skyrocketing, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to rank the top 15 energy infrastructure stocks that achieved the highest gains over the past six months. We also included their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database of 900 elite hedge funds as of Q3 of 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of 6-month performance, as of January 2. Why do we care about what hedge funds do?

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Returns in Past 6 Months: 65.86% Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15 Excelerate Energy, Inc. (NYSE:EE) is a leading provider of integrated liquefied natural gas (LNG) solutions. The company specializes in floating LNG regasification infrastructure, LNG supply, and energy delivery services. Excelerate Energy, Inc. (NYSE:EE) operates both LNG carriers and Floating Storage Regasification Units (FSRU), a vessel that stores LNG and turns it back into gas, once it arrives at its destination. The stock price of Excelerate Energy, Inc. (NYSE:EE) has increased significantly over the last six months, driven by the company’s strong financial performance and growth prospects. Additionally, the company’s decision to more than double its quarterly dividend has also provided a positive catalyst for the stock. Excelerate Energy, Inc. (NYSE:EE) has signed a strategic partnership agreement with PetroVietnam Technical Services Corporation to develop FSRU-based LNG solutions in Vietnam. This partnership has provided a new market opportunity for Excelerate Energy, Inc. (NYSE:EE). Excelerate Energy, Inc. (NYSE:EE) has also signed midterm agreements to purchase and sell approximately 0.65 million tons of LNG in one of the Atlantic Basin regions, which will help optimize its supply portfolio and support commercial opportunities in its pipeline. This agreement, along with others is expected to provide a stable source of revenue and help to drive growth for the company. Furthermore, Excelerate Energy, Inc.’s (NYSE:EE) ability to buy and sell LNG at the prices from the European natural gas index, helps to derisk margin and provides a competitive advantage in the market.

Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP) has a significant presence in the Permian Basin. Targa Resources Corp.’s (NYSE:TRGP) stock price has increased significantly, driven by a combination of factors. One of the primary drivers of this increase has been the company’s shift to the fee-based business model, which provides a stable source of revenue and reduces the company’s exposure to commodity price volatility. The company’s gathering and processing agreements along with logistics and transportation business have been structured as fee-based contracts, where producers pay a fixed fee for each unit of natural gas or NGLs gathered and processed. This provides Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP) with a predictable revenue stream, regardless of the underlying commodity prices. Looking ahead, Targa Resources Corp.’s (NYSE:TRGP) future outlook appears strong, driven by the growing demand for energy infrastructure in the Permian Basin. The company’s recent announcement of two new gathering and processing plants, Falcon 2 and East Driver, is expected to further drive growth and increase the company’s processing capacity in the region.

Title: Pundit Explains Why China Could Be About To Quietly Launch Bitcoin Price To The Moon

The price of Bitcoin continued its rebound on Friday, with the world’s largest and oldest crypto inching closer to the much-coveted $100,000 level. BTC registered an impressive rally in 2024, largely due to the BlackRock-spurred Wall Street Bitcoin revolution and Donald Trump’s shock victory on Nov. 6. Now, a popular investor is predicting that China will create Bitcoin’s next glorious rally as it unleashes its much-awaited bazooka fiscal stimulus. For context, the Financial Times revealed that the People’s Bank of China is set to slash its interest rates in order to prop up its stalling economy. This, according to Bill Miller IV, a portfolio manager at Miller Value Partners, might be the bullish catalyst that catapults Bitcoin to new highs. “Looks like China is going to drive the next leg higher in #Bitcoin,” Miller wrote in a Jan. 3 post on X. Miller also cited the United States launching a strategic Bitcoin reserve as another potential trigger for a meteoric bull run in 2025. Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have been thrust into the limelight as investors bet that the incoming Trump administration will usher in a more friendly regulatory environment. “We’re gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China or anybody else — not just China but others are embracing it — and we want to be the head,” President-elect Donald Trump said during a mid-December interview. As ZyCrypto previously covered, Trump vowed to establish a national Bitcoin reserve on the campaign trail. If such a plan materializes, it would mean the U.S. government would hold a stockpile of the premier crypto as it already does with other assets, like oil and gold. It’s worth mentioning that governments around the world held roughly 2.2% of Bitcoin’s total supply as of July, as per CoinGecko data, with the U.S. holding approximately 213,297 BTC. China, the UK, Bhutan, and El Salvador are other nations with considerable Bitcoin stashes, data tracked by BitcoinTreasuries shows. Moreover, politicians in Japan and Germany have signaled their interest in giving BTC reserve status in their nations.

Title: Musk’s Unregretted Seconds: A Lesson In Speculaive Investing

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 02: Elon Musk attends The 2022 Met Gala Celebrating "In America: An ... [+] Anthology of Fashion" at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 02, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue) Ever wonder how Elon Musk avoids investment regrets even with high-stake decisions? In the realm of investments, it's easy to gauge success based just on the sheer volume of agreements or the dizzying sums of money put in place. But as Elon Musk's open analysis of "unregretted seconds" reminds us, not all hasty actions produce desired results. When developing your investment plan, the quality of every investment should take front stage rather than the number. This strategy guarantees that any investment not only could be quite profitable but also fits your financial objectives, risk tolerance, and investing schedule. After all, a careful choosing procedure helps to avoid a future full of regretful rushes, missing details and ultimately becoming part of a speculative financial bubble. The appeal of trendy assets has enthralled investors' wallets and imaginations repeatedly across history. From the Dutch Tulip Mania of the 17th century to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and most recently, the explosive rise and fall of cryptocurrencies like Fartcoin, these financial events have shown a common pattern of fast expansion followed by usually catastrophic collapses. This cyclical character of investing fads not only illustrates the continuous over-optimism in human financial behavior but also emphasizes the great influence these trends can have on individual investors and the whole economy. Understanding history helps us to equip ourselves with insights to negotiate the sometimes seductive but possibly dangerous seas of fashionable investment prospects. Early 17th century tulip bulbs in the Netherlands evolved from an expensive curiosity to a sought-after commodity, sparking the first significant financial bubble. Tulips traded on stock exchanges and special markets as prices skyrocketed. Some bulbs sold at the height of the mania for six times the average annual salary. This craze came to a head in 1637 when the market collapsed unexpectedly, ruining a lot of investors. The spectacular fall acted as a warning story about market volatility and speculation. Under a deal with Spain, the early 18th-century South Sea Company was given a monopoly to trade with South America. Speculators raised its possible profits while share prices surged. The corporation entered government debt with great promise for rewards, which stoked an even more speculative frenzy. Realization dawned in 1720 that the bubble burst and that the earnings fell far short of expectations. Financial devastation among thousands of investors, many from the aristocracy. This highlights the risks of illogical speculative excess. The Dot-com Bubble driven by the fast expansion of the internet and new technology, investments in internet companies surged in the late 1990s. Investors were ready to support anything connected to the dot-com industry, which drove inflated valuations for firms lacking even clear strategies to turn a profit. Reality set in motion by 2000 as market mood changed and income fell short of expectations. The fall of the bubble caused great losses for investors and company collapses, which emphasizes the vital relevance of basic business measures in investing decisions. These episodes highlight the cyclical nature of investment fads as well as provide insightful analysis of the consequences of divorcing financial aspirations from economic reality. Every occurrence changed financial history and taught the next generations of investors the dangers of chasing price compared to value. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 11: Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index Investments ... [+] at Blackrock, (C) rings the opening bell as Bitcoin Spot ETF's are launched on the Nasdaq Exchange on January 11, 2024 in New York City. The trading of several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to the milestone for the cryptocurrency industry that has been seeking regulatory approval for the financial product for over a decade.(Photo by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images) Greed and Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) are strong emotional motivators that can force investors to enter high-risk businesses. The attraction of rapid, large profits can skew judgment and cause investors to ignore the inherent dangers of a certain investment. In a rising market, when news of significant profits by others can create a sense of urgency and a wish not to be left behind, this fear of missing out on a great chance is especially strong. These feelings can lead to illogical purchasing, which drives prices to unsustainable heights until the natural correction takes place. Herd mentality is very important in magnifying financial trends in which the supposed safety in numbers can mislead people about the soundness of an investment. More people invest, others are inclined to follow, often without doing their necessary research. Confirmation bias, where investors search for data supporting their choice to join the majority and ignore warning signals, helps to perpetuate this behavior. Investors driven by peer influence and the need to fit in may make judgments based more on group behavior than on wise financial judgment, hence creating investment bubbles until they finally explode. These psychological elements taken together help to create and spread financial bubbles as well as to cause their ultimate collapse, therefore costing many investors large losses. Investors seeking more disciplined and logical financial decisions must first understand these emotional factors. Nikola Motors A strong foundation in basic analysis is among the best defenses against the attraction of investment fads. Emphasizing real data above market hype, this strategy entails a comprehensive assessment of a company's financial situation, market posture, and growth potential. Knowing the inherent worth of an investment enables investors to make wise selections based on long-term profitability and stability rather than transient trends. Analyzing whether the price of an investment is justified or inflated by speculative excitement depends on tools including debt levels, price-to-earnings ratios, and income growth. Another main tactic in protecting your portfolio from the volatility of fad investments is diversification. You can lower their risk of major losses from any one investment by diversifying their investments among several asset classes, sectors, and locations. This approach serves to lessen the effects of sector-specific downturns and investment bubble busting. A well-diverse portfolio guarantees that the loss or underperformance of one investment does not compromise general financial situation by balancing risk. Have the long-term view. To resist the clamor and temptation of popular assets, one must have a long-term view of investing. Long-term investors are more likely to gain from compound growth of sound investments than they are influenced by fleeting market swings. This strategy calls for endurance and a will to keep the course even if transient trends seem to be quite profitable. You may create a strong portfolio that resists the vagaries of market trends and speculative financial bubbles by including basic research, diversity, and a long-term view into your investing plan. These vital instruments not only protect you from the dangers of ephemeral trends but also help you to realize steady financial development. Recall that smart, intentional investments, not following the next great idea, are the road to true riches. Armed with these techniques, you will confidently and resiliently negotiate the investment terrain. Lastly remember, take Elon Musk’s advice and apply it to investing. One Community. Many Voices.

New data reveals that asset management titan BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) saw a record number of outflows earlier this week. According to data from blockchain tracker SoSoValue, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) saw a staggering $332.6 million worth of outflows on January 2nd, its largest day of outflows on record. The data also shows that other spot market BTC ETFs were mostly in the green as Fidelity’s FBTC, Arkham’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB all posted inflows of $36.2 million, $16.5 million, and $48.3 million respectively. Another notable ETF that posted outflows was Grayscale’s GBTC, coming in at $23 million. IBIT and GBTC’s combined outflows made the first trading day of the year red for ETFs associated with the top crypto asset by market cap, bringing down daily total net inflows to -$242.3 million. IBIT launched in January of 2024 after Bitcoin-based ETFs were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after a judge ordered the regulatory agency to rethink its viewpoint on the matter to remain consistent with its other stances. In November, it was reported that IBIT had surpassed BlackRock’s gold ETF (IAU) in terms of net assets, reaching over $33 billion. As stated by Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute, at the time, “iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has now surpassed iShares Gold ETF in assets… Did this in 10 months. IAU launched in January 2005. Absolutely wild.” IBIT is trading for $56.04 at time of writing. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

AI stocks started to lose steam near the end of 2024 and investors are preparing for what could be a year of slow growth. In its 2025 outlook, T. Rowe Price said the global economy could slow down in the new year amid growth headwinds in China and the impact of higher interest rates. Dividend stocks could be a good option for investors looking for stability and consistent income. Let's examine a case study of an investor who reached a decent dividend income milestone thanks to patience and wise picks.

"Not a bad idea to do both dividends and growth stocks, but my portfolio is mainly growth with income."

Scott Levine (Nio): From the prospect of new European tariffs to dwindling revenue, a number of factors motivated investors to steer this electric car (EV) stock out of their portfolios over the past year. In fact, shares of Nio plunged about 52% in 2024, in contrast to the 24% rise they enjoyed in 2023. It could take several decades for these high-risk tickers to bear their full fruit.

Title: The Glaring Hypocrisy and Embedded Deceptions of the Global Food Giants
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/the-glaring-hypocrisy-and-embedded-deceptions-of-the-global-food-giants/
Time Published: 2025-01-04T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
EditorHealth Colin Todhunter, OffGuardian Colin Todhunter, OffGuardian Bryce Martinez (18) from Pennsylvania is mounting a legal challenge against major food companies, alleging that their ultra-processed foods (UPFs) led to his development of Type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease at the age of 16. The 11 firms listed in the lawsuit are Kraft Heinz, Mondelez, Coca-Cola, Post Holdings, PepsiCo, General Mills, Nestle’s (US), WK Kellogg, Mars, Kellanova and Conagra. UPFs have undergone multiple processing steps and often contain additives, preservatives and artificial ingredients. These UPFs have become staples in many households. Examples of UPFs are prepackaged soups, many breakfast cereals, sauces, frozen pizza, ready-to-eat meals, hot dogs, sausages, sodas, ice cream and store-bought cookies, cakes, candies and doughnuts. Martinez’s legal team contends that the big food corporations have deliberately engineered their products to trigger addictive responses. His lawyers at Morgan & Morgan, a major US law firm, says the case is unprecedented and includes claims for conspiracy, negligence, fraudulent misrepresentation and unfair business practices. Martinez had regularly consumed popular UPFs throughout his childhood. The lawsuit challenges the food industry’s argument that consumers have free choice in their dietary decisions. It argues that the notion of free choice is compromised by aggressive marketing tactics, especially aimed at children, and the addictive nature of these products. UPFs are highly profitable for corporations. The same companies that dominate the UPF market are intertwined with investment firms like BlackRock and Vanguard, which also hold stakes in the pharmaceutical industry. This dual investment creates a cycle where investment firms profit from both the sale of harmful foods and the treatment of diseases associated with these products. Furthermore, the prevailing economic system creates a paradoxical situation where workers, whose pension funds are often managed by these same investment giants, find themselves financially tethered to a cycle that undermines their own health and well-being. There is a famous quote often attributed to farmer, poet and campaigner Wendell Berry: People are fed by the food industry, which pays no attention to health, and are treated by the health industry, which pays no attention to food.” For a long time, that has served both industry’s interests very well. The influence that giant corporations have on the food system is encapsulated by the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). Presenting itself as an independent scientific organisation, across the world, from China to India, the ILSI plays a crucial role in promoting narratives that benefit its corporate funders. According to the report Partnership for an Unhealthy Planet (Corporate Accountability, 2020), political interference by food and beverage transnationals like Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Nestlé and PepsiCo is pervasive. The report shows how these corporations have leveraged the ILSI to cripple progress on nutrition policy across the globe. After documenting that the ILSI has spun a complex web of revolving doors or partnering with leading research institutions in India (including “controlling” the Niti Aayog, the Government of India’s policy think tank) to denigrate traditional diets, the report states: ILSI India is emblematic of how ILSI at large ensures that the food and beverage industry are able to deepen their capture of public policy and discourse thereabouts across the globe. One such example of this is an ILSI-sponsored study on sugar consumption by two of India’s most respected research entities, the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Nutrition.” It adds: …the study’s intent seems to be the absolution of food products marketed by ILSI’s corporate backers and/or redirection of public dietary concerns toward the traditional foods ILSI’s funders would hope to supplant.” The ILSI generates scientific data and provides it to state agencies, working to harmonise food regulations and facilitate international trade, not least by shaping Codex standards and guidelines. It has a notable influence on Codex through its collaborations with regulatory bodies involved in setting food safety standards. The Codex Alimentarius Commission is an international organisation jointly run by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Its published goals are to develop and adopt uniform food standards for its member countries and to promote the free and unhindered international flow of food goods, thereby eliminating trade barriers to food and (supposedly) providing food safety. Biotechnology, pesticides, food additives and contaminants are some of the issues discussed in Codex meetings. The FAO says: “Codex standards are based on the best available science assisted by independent international risk assessment bodies or ad-hoc consultations organized by FAO and WHO.” Codex standards serve in many cases as a basis for national legislation. It decides on minimum food residue levels for pesticides, allowable amounts of aluminium, lead and arsenic in food and which substances or products are dangerous. These decisions affect the products and markets of huge corporations that have hundreds of millions of dollars at stake. The ILSI has infiltrated key national and international food and health regulatory and decision-making bodies in an attempt to lobby away or discredit any potential decision that may affect their bottom line (see The opaque world of Codex Alimentarius and Monsanto ‘toxic’ relations). According to Ivica Kelam of the Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek in Croatia: The ILSI enjoys close relationships with regulatory bodies including the Joint WHO/FAO Expert Committee on Food Additives and the European Food Safety Authority, which rely on the substantial resources controlled by the ILSI. The organisation not only influences Codex standards through direct cooperation with national and international regulators but also indirectly through the networks it develops.” Funders of the ILSI have included at some point Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Mars, Mondelez, General Mills, Nestle, Kellogg, Hershey, Kraft, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Starbucks Coffee, Monsanto, CropLife International, Syngenta, Dow AgroSciences, Pioneer Hi-Bred, Bayer CropScience, BASF, Cargill, Unilever and Campbell Soup (see the reports Pushing partnerships: corporate influence on research and policy via the International Life Sciences Institute and ILSI is a food industry lobby group). Bryce Martinez is up against some very powerful forces that will do everything they possibly can to stave off any challenge that could potentially represent a critical threat to their power, profits and practices. In late 2020, the Global Health Advocacy Incubator (GHAI) released a report that described how Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Nestlé and PepsiCo used the COVID event to aggressively market UPFs. In Brazil, Nestlé, Bauducco and Danone donated more than 400 tons of food, including UFPs deemed unhealthy according to official Brazilian dietary guidelines. In South Africa, Coca-Cola donated soft drinks to families in townships and multiple healthcare centres. The GHAI notes that big food corporations also touted their unhealthy UPFs as essential, safe products and immune boosters. In Brazil, The ILSI cynically promoted processed foods as allies in the fight against COVID. In Japan, Coca-Cola encouraged people to exercise at home while ‘in quarantine’ through online exercise videos, pledging to donate up to one million drinks to app users who tracked 1,000 steps a day. In Brazil, McDonalds posted videos on X showing kids pressuring their parents to go to McDonalds during ‘quarantine’ to safely pick up food through the contactless drive thru. The report highlighted how the lack of healthy food regulations worldwide enabled these corporations to polish their public images while undermining public health. The reality is that research indicates diets high in UPFs may undermine immunity through several mechanisms, primarily related to nutrient deficiencies, inflammation and alterations in the gut microbiome. The GHAI says that the very companies who had already contributed to rising rates of obesity and diet-related diseases exploited the COVID event to position themselves and their products as “essential” while also, directly and indirectly, influencing public health policy. A peer-reviewed study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine showed that increased consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) was associated with more than 10 per cent of all-cause premature, preventable deaths in Brazil in 2019. UPFs have steadily replaced the consumption of traditional whole foods, such as rice and beans, in Brazil (see also the report Free trade and Mexico’s junk food epidemic). In high-income countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, UPFs account for more than half of total calorific intake, a much higher figure than that for Brazil. And it is the poorer sections of society that rely more on UPF items because of their low cost. Yet corporate-backed narratives often downplay these risks or frame them as issues of personal responsibility rather than systemic problems. Studies have associated UPFs with significant increased risks of cardiovascular disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure and abnormal blood lipid levels, anxiety and mental disorders, depression and cognitive decline and impairment. There is also increased risk of certain cancers, particularly ovarian and breast cancers. (See this, this, this and this.) The GHAI report described how the very corporations that have driven the spiralling public health crisis to alarming levels were using an event framed as a public health emergency to their advantage. Their cynicism and hypocrisy are impossible to ignore. What was once nature’s gift (wholesome food) has been transformed to become an industrial commodity. As UPS have come to increasingly dominate diets and wreak havoc on human health, profit margins are boosted and consumers are regarded as mere collateral damage to be rinsed for further profit by the ‘healthcare’ industry.

Title: Wall Street’s Top Banks Just Abandoned a Once Popular Alliance

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Within the span of a month, Wall Street’s biggest banks have quit what had been one of the most popular clubs inside global finance. Most Read from Bloomberg Is This Weird Dome the Future of Watching Sports? NYC Congestion Pricing to Take Effect After Years of Delays NYPD Seeking Gunmen After 10 People Wounded Outside Queens Venue NYC Congestion Pricing Takes Effect After Years of Delays Burned-Out Parents Need Better Public Spaces The Net-Zero Banking Alliance — a group dedicated to helping lenders reduce their carbon footprints — has in quick succession been abandoned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest US bank, looks to be next in line. The moves reflect US banks’ desire to shield themselves from increasing political pressure as Donald Trump returns to the White House, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. And NZBA is bracing for more US exits, Secretariat Lead Sarah Kemmitt told members in a Dec. 31 letter seen by Bloomberg. She cited the “political environment.” At the same time, the real-world impact of the NZBA defections is unclear. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, banks have collectively stepped up their financing of the fossil-fuel industry since the alliance was formed in 2021. Membership of NZBA was likely more a case of “virtue signaling” than “meaningful climate impacts,” said Jill Fisch, a business law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. A spokesperson for NZBA declined to comment. Activists are now demanding that the government intervene to target Wall Street. Environmental Advocates NY, a nonprofit, says it’s urging New York state officials to introduce regulations and laws that would compel banks operating in the world’s biggest financial hub to take climate action. The wave of NZBA exits follows behind-the-scenes tensions that have been brewing for more than two years, Bloomberg’s reporting has shown. In 2022, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were among banks pushing back against binding targets on climate finance. NZBA then watered down some requirements, and members stayed put. But as the Republican Party grows more hostile toward climate-friendly organizations, the finance industry is repositioning itself. Global temperatures are rising fast, yet banks continue to reap short-term profits by sticking with fossil fuel producers. It’s therefore both “distressing and unsurprising” that Wall Street is turning it’s back on net zero alliances, said Ken Pucker, who teaches sustainability at the Fletcher School at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. The alliances were created in order to encourage the finance industry to take into account the longer-term cost of supporting oil, gas and coal. Back in 2021, when NZBA was formed, banks now leaving the alliance proudly touted their membership. BofA Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan spoke of a “commitment to net zero” in his role as co-chair of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, whose stated mission is to “build a coordinated global effort” to help green the private sector. And in an April 2021 statement announcing its agenda, the world’s biggest coalition for climate finance — the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero — said it would “require signatories to set science-aligned interim and long-term goals to reach net zero no later than 2050.” GFANZ ended 2024 by recalibrating its mission as banks flee and GOP attacks intensify. The group is distancing itself from the net zero alliances for which it had previously been an umbrella organization. Going forward, GFANZ will make its guidance available to financial firms, whether they’ve committed to a net zero alliance or not. A spokesperson for GFANZ declined to comment beyond the group’s public statements. Banks that sign up to NZBA still commit to transition their financed emissions to align with “pathways to net zero by 2050” at the latest, according to its website. They’re also required to provide 2030 targets to show they’re on track, and to document their progress.

Wall Street is now navigating a world in which bankers and money managers suspected of being unsupportive of the GOP’s pro-fossil fuel agenda face a growing threat of litigation.

The committee, which is led by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, singled out GFANZ and similar groups for leading what it described as a climate crusade. GOP members have made clear they feel increasingly emboldened. After hearing of the defections from NZBA, Republican Congressman-elect Riley Moore of West Virginia said via a spokesperson that he will keep trying to ban and block financial firms suspected of supporting “anti-fossil fuel ESG policies.” Meanwhile, Wall Street firms continue to earn considerably more from arranging fossil-fuel deals than their European counterparts. Last year, JPMorgan topped the league table of banks underwriting bonds and loans for oil, gas and coal companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was followed by Wells Fargo, TD Securities, BofA, RBC Capital Markets and Citigroup.

Title: Wall Street’s Top Banks Just Abandoned a Once Popular Alliance

(Bloomberg) -- Within the span of a month, Wall Street’s biggest banks have quit what had been one of the most popular clubs inside global finance. Most Read from Bloomberg Is This Weird Dome the Future of Watching Sports? NYC Congestion Pricing to Take Effect After Years of Delays NYPD Seeking Gunmen After 10 People Wounded Outside Queens Venue NYC Congestion Pricing Takes Effect After Years of Delays Burned-Out Parents Need Better Public Spaces The Net-Zero Banking Alliance — a group dedicated to helping lenders reduce their carbon footprints — has in quick succession been abandoned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest US bank, looks to be next in line. The moves reflect US banks’ desire to shield themselves from increasing political pressure as Donald Trump returns to the White House, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. And NZBA is bracing for more US exits, Secretariat Lead Sarah Kemmitt told members in a Dec. 31 letter seen by Bloomberg. She cited the “political environment.” At the same time, the real-world impact of the NZBA defections is unclear. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, banks have collectively stepped up their financing of the fossil-fuel industry since the alliance was formed in 2021. Membership of NZBA was likely more a case of “virtue signaling” than “meaningful climate impacts,” said Jill Fisch, a business law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. A spokesperson for NZBA declined to comment. Activists are now demanding that the government intervene to target Wall Street. Environmental Advocates NY, a nonprofit, says it’s urging New York state officials to introduce regulations and laws that would compel banks operating in the world’s biggest financial hub to take climate action. The wave of NZBA exits follows behind-the-scenes tensions that have been brewing for more than two years, Bloomberg’s reporting has shown. In 2022, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were among banks pushing back against binding targets on climate finance. NZBA then watered down some requirements, and members stayed put. But as the Republican Party grows more hostile toward climate-friendly organizations, the finance industry is repositioning itself. Global temperatures are rising fast, yet banks continue to reap short-term profits by sticking with fossil fuel producers. It’s therefore both “distressing and unsurprising” that Wall Street is turning it’s back on net zero alliances, said Ken Pucker, who teaches sustainability at the Fletcher School at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. The alliances were created in order to encourage the finance industry to take into account the longer-term cost of supporting oil, gas and coal. Back in 2021, when NZBA was formed, banks now leaving the alliance proudly touted their membership. BofA Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan spoke of a “commitment to net zero” in his role as co-chair of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, whose stated mission is to “build a coordinated global effort” to help green the private sector. And in an April 2021 statement announcing its agenda, the world’s biggest coalition for climate finance — the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero — said it would “require signatories to set science-aligned interim and long-term goals to reach net zero no later than 2050.” GFANZ ended 2024 by recalibrating its mission as banks flee and GOP attacks intensify. The group is distancing itself from the net zero alliances for which it had previously been an umbrella organization. Going forward, GFANZ will make its guidance available to financial firms, whether they’ve committed to a net zero alliance or not. A spokesperson for GFANZ declined to comment beyond the group’s public statements. Banks that sign up to NZBA still commit to transition their financed emissions to align with “pathways to net zero by 2050” at the latest, according to its website. They’re also required to provide 2030 targets to show they’re on track, and to document their progress. All banks exiting NZBA have made public statements to say they still recognize decarbonization as a worthy goal. But they’ve also made clear that their biggest duty is to serve the needs of their clients. None has provided an official reason for quitting the alliance.

(NYSE:ACHR) stands against other firms under tech, energy, and aviation, which led Friday's rally. Wall Street’s main indices finished in the green territory on Friday amid a series of catalysts buoying investor appetite. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.80 percent, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallied by 1.26 percent and 1.77 percent, respectively. Eleven companies—predominantly in the technology, energy, and aviation sectors—posted notable gains. Here is why: To come up with Friday’s top advancers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A technician assembling an electric aircraft, highlighting the company's manufacturing capabilities. Archer Aviation Inc. (NYSE:ACHR) rallied by more than 20 percent anew on Friday, adding 1.94 points to close at $11.51 apiece following news that the US could restrict Chinese drones which would favor US companies like Archer. On Thursday, the US Commerce Department said it was mulling over banning Chinese drones in the country over national security issues. According to the department, threats from China and Russia “may offer our adversaries the ability to remotely access and manipulate these devices, exposing sensitive US data.” The final decision to write new rules restricting or banning Chinese drones will be made by the incoming Donald Trump administration, which takes over on January 20. In September last year, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that she was considering imposing restrictions on China-made drones similar to those that would effectively ban Chinese vehicles from the US. Raimondo said her department would focus on drones with Chinese and Russian equipment, chips, and software. Overall, ACHR ranks 4th on our list of firms under tech, energy, and aviation, which led Friday's rally. While we acknowledge the potential of ACHR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

According to analysts, investors bought up shares of TeraWulf (WULF) and other Bitcoin mining companies as traders await more updates and developments on the cryptocurrency under the incoming presidency of Donald Trump.

EditorEconomy Kurt Schlichter, The Burning Platform Guest Post by Kurt Schlichter The Burning Platform In my January 1, 2024, column entitled “Top Twenty Terrible Predictions for 2024,” I noted that, “Every year, I offer you my predictions for the coming trip around the Sun, and every year, I’m mostly wrong.” Back then, I predicted that “I think [2024] will be a disaster.” Shows what I know. Personally, I had two houses flood from broken plumbing and practically became a general contractor. That sucked. But in the macro, it was a pretty good year for America. I predicted that “Trump is not going to be subject to any federal trials this year…. The state cases might, but they are idiotic too.” I also predicted that “the 14th Amendment nonsense is going to get shot down. I thought Hunter would plead out. As expected, Joe Biden was “not held accountable for his crimes.” Then there was this: “I really like Ron DeSantis, but there’s a significant chance that Donald Trump is going to be the nominee.” Oh, but then I ruined it by predicting that “if he is the nominee, he picks Nikki Haley and, for reasons I will set out in an upcoming Townhall column, that’s a good idea…from his perspective.” Boy, did that column stir the pot! I also correctly predicted that “she’ll continue to spew consultant-generated corporate-friendly cliches and hack talking points as she seeks to turn back the clock on Republicanism twenty years.” I predicted that “Israel is going to rout Hamas,” but also that “there will be some sort of talks to resolve the Ukraine open wound.” I was right that “the Houthis will continue to humiliate America and will be on the receiving end of a few puny airstrikes.” At home, I foresaw leftist riots. Those did not happen. I predicted that “the border crisis will continue unabated,” and Biden pretended to abate it a little bit. I also correctly saw that “the GOP squish caucus will enter into a compromise to solve it.” Senator Jim Amnesty Lankford makes an appearance in my “Biggest Idiots of 2024” column. I was right that we would win the Senate but wrong when I predicted that “we will lose the House because we are Republicans and Republicans are stupid.” In fact, we won it, barely, because Republicans are stupid. I was wrong when I predicted a Supreme Court vacancy to be filled by “a pinko BIPOC differently-abled nonbinary two-spirit of heft.” I was right when I predicted that wokeness would peak and begin to decline. I was right that “the women’s Olympic medals will all be won by men, proving that men are better than women at everything, including being women.” I was also right that “the Regime Media will suffer more layoffs and bankruptcies, and there will be much rejoicing.” I expected the football guy to dump Taylor Swift. I don’t know whether that happened or not. I was doing pretty well until I got here: “Joe Biden is not going to be replaced, and he will be on the ballot in November. I’m not sure if he’ll know it, though. Man, picking Kamala Harris was the greatest insurance policy anybody ever took out.” I further opined that “the Democrats will win in November.” In my defense, I said that hoping “my track record of being wrong about my predictions holds up.” It held up, thankfully. Here’s what I think will happen in 2025: Once again, see you in 12 months, assuming these idiots have not caused a nuclear and/or civil war in the meantime so that I can give you some more inevitably wrong predictions for 2026.

Title: Why Harmony Gold (HMY) Is One of the Best Middle East and Africa Stocks to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Middle East and Africa Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (NYSE:HMY) stands against other best Middle East and Africa stocks to buy right now. Global financial giants are increasingly turning their attention to the Middle East and are establishing operations in cities such as Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Riyadh. With attractive incentives such as low taxes, and robust regulatory frameworks, the region has become a magnet for investment banks, hedge funds, asset managers, family offices, and law firms. Major players like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley have strengthened their presence across the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Asset management firms are also joining the trend. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has maintained a strong foothold in Saudi Arabia since opening its Riyadh office in 2019. Meanwhile, Wellington Management and Fiera Capital made their regional debuts in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, respectively, underscoring the region’s growing appeal for global asset managers. These firms are drawn by opportunities in the Gulf’s booming financial sector and the region’s commitment to diversifying beyond oil revenues. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is set to remain the world’s top destination for wealthy individuals for the third consecutive year, with a projected net inflow of 6,700 millionaires by the end of 2024, according to the Henley Private Wealth Migration Report. This figure significantly surpasses the United States, which ranks second with an expected net inflow of 3,800 millionaires. The UAE’s appeal lies in its favorable tax policies, strategic geographic location, world-class infrastructure, and attractive long-term residency programs such as the “golden visa.” Africa is also an attractive place for investments, as demonstrated by the resounding success of the Africa Investment Forum 2024, which concluded on December 6 in Rabat, Morocco. The event secured an impressive $29.2 billion in new investor commitments after three days of intensive boardroom discussions. This year’s Forum witnessed a record attendance of 2,300 investors and delegates from 83 countries, marking a 60% increase from the previous year. Across 41 investment boardrooms, participants engaged in discussions spanning sectors such as transport, power, energy, agribusiness, industry, mining, pharmaceuticals, private equity, tourism, urban infrastructure, and water management. One standout success from the Forum was Nigeria’s Special Agro-Processing Zone project, which aimed to raise $975 million but secured $4.8 billion in investor interest. Similarly, projects from Morocco and the Democratic Republic of the Congo attracted investments surpassing initial targets. The Forum’s founding partners, including Africa50, Afreximbank, the Development Bank of Southern Africa, the Africa Finance Corporation, and the Islamic Development Bank, reaffirmed their dedication to strengthening collaboration and driving transformative investments across the continent. As global financial powerhouses continue to deepen their roots in the Middle East and investors increasingly turn their focus to Africa’s vast potential, both regions are emerging as pivotal hubs in the evolving global economic landscape.

To compile our list of the 12 best Middle East and Africa stocks to buy right now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 30 largest companies in the Middle East and Africa. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 12 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 11 Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (NYSE:HMY) is a South African gold mining and exploration company. The company operates multiple mines in South Africa and Papua New Guinea and has established itself as a specialist gold producer with a growing international copper footprint. Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (NYSE:HMY) is focused on optimizing its existing operations, particularly its underground mines in South Africa. The company has allocated $117.18 million towards decline projects at these mines in FY25, which will enable it to maintain flexibility and reduce costs. Additionally, Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (NYSE:HMY) is conducting studies to determine whether the life of the mine at its Hidden Valley can be extended further. The company is also progressing with a feasibility study update on its Wafi-Golpu copper project, which has the potential to become a significant contributor to the company’s future growth. Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (NYSE:HMY) is also exploring new opportunities to grow its business, including the development of its surface operations in South Africa. The company has identified significant potential in its old tailings dams, with 5.7 million ounces of resources in the Free State. A feasibility study is underway to determine the viability of re-mining these tailings, which could potentially create another mega tailings retreatment operation. Furthermore, Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (NYSE:HMY) is constantly looking for opportunities to acquire high-quality assets that can enhance the company’s portfolio and drive growth. Overall, HMY ranks 8th on our list of best Middle East and Africa stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of HMY to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NYSE:NIO) stands against the other best long-term penny stocks to buy. On December 3rd, Bob Kaynor, CFA, Head of US Small & Midcap Equities at Schroders, provided a comprehensive outlook for small-cap stocks in 2025, emphasizing their potential as a cost-effective investment in the robust US economy. He mentioned that the economy has shown resilience post-pandemic, bolstered by fiscal stimulus from the Biden Administration through significant legislation like the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This recovery is primarily driven by strong consumer spending and a favorable labor market. In this robust environment while large-cap equities may appear expensive and have likely priced in much of the anticipated growth, small and mid-cap stocks remain relatively undervalued. This presents an opportunity for investors to gain exposure to domestic economic strength without incurring high costs. Kaynor identified several trends, which he believes could enhance the performance of small and mid-cap stocks in 2025. He pointed out that following a downturn in 2022 and 2023 due to recession fears and high valuations, M&A activity is now rebounding. This resurgence is expected to benefit small-cap stocks as they often become acquisition targets. Additionally, increased IPO activity can generate interest and optimism in the small-cap sector. Moreover, the ongoing and anticipated decline in interest rates starting late 2024 is expected to reduce borrowing costs for small-cap companies, which typically rely on short-term financing. This environment is historically favorable for small caps, particularly when inflation stabilizes between 1% and 3%. Kaynor also noted that the service sector of the market is expanding. The services sector not only forms a significant portion of the GDP but also favors small-cap companies primarily those operating within this space. Moreover, trends like reshoring are enabling small firms to become reliable suppliers for larger corporations. He expects that increased CapEx driven by automation and government support in sectors like semiconductors will likely correlate with revenue growth for small caps, further enhancing their investment appeal next year. Kaynor noted that Wall Street analysts predict a substantial rebound in earnings for small caps beginning in late 2024, with expectations that their growth will outpace large caps throughout most of 2025. A fleet of eco-friendly electric cars, a symbol of the company's commitment to sustainability. To curate the list of the 12 best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener we got an initial list of penny stocks (trading under $5) with more than 20% 5-year sales growth. Next, we cross-checked each stock for 5-year sales growth from Seeking Alpha. Lastly, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders sourced from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 hedge funds database. Please note that the stock prices were recorded on December 31, 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stock Price: $4.36 5-Year Sales Growth: 49.65% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20 NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) is another Chinese automotive company that focuses on developing premium smart electric vehicles. One of its standout features is its battery-swapping technology, which allows drivers to quickly exchange their depleted batteries for fully charged ones at designated stations. Moreover, in September 2024, the company introduced a mass-market brand called ONVO, which focuses on providing vehicles that also support battery swapping and various battery range options. During the fiscal third quarter of 2024, NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) set a new record with 61,855 vehicle deliveries, marking an increase of 11.6% year-over-year and a 7.8% increase from the previous quarter. The company maintained its status as the top-selling brand in China’s battery electric vehicle (BEV) segment for vehicles priced above RMB 300,000, capturing a 48% market share in that category. Moreover, its ONVO brand began delivering its first model, the L60, a midsize SUV that competes directly with popular models like the Tesla Model Y and Toyota RAV4. Its upcoming flagship model, the ET9, is in the final testing phase with deliveries expected to start in March 2025. NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) plans to increase its monthly production capacity to 10,000 units by December 2024 and further to 20,000 units by March 2025, supporting its growth strategy as it prepares for new product launches. Overall, NIO ranks 3rd on our list of best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NIO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Opinion: The climate agenda is in rapid retreat as right-wing parties rise everywhere
URL: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-the-climate-agenda-is-in-rapid-retreat-as-right-wing-parties-rise/

Environmental activists take part in a protest during the COP29 UN climate change conference, in Baku, Azerbaijan, on Nov. 22, 2024.Aziz Karimov/Reuters The last time Greta Thunberg posted a message on Twitter, now X, was on Nov. 27, and she did not mention climate, or global warming, or heating, though she did mention ecocide. It was about the oppression of the Kurds in Kurdistan. Ms. Thunberg, with 5.3 million X followers, became the public face of youth-led climate activism when she was in her mid-teens – she is now 21 – and appears to have taken her foot off the climate gas pedal in recent months. She is not alone. Governments everywhere seem burnt out on climate change, even as temperatures continue to set records and climate emergencies abound (the global average temperature reached an all-time high last July 22). Ditto investors and average citizens. Climate last year fell off global political and fiscal agendas and may not reappear any time soon. Take the annual United Nations-sponsored climate conferences. Can anyone remember what was accomplished, if anything, at November’s COP29 (Conference of the Parties) in Azerbaijan? Or any of the previous ones? COP21 in Paris in 2015 was the last climate summit that made global headlines, that made a genuine breakthrough and finished on an optimistic note. The Paris Agreement, which applied to all countries, sought to limit the rise in global average temperatures to 1.5 C over preindustrial levels. Ditto the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, also last November. Climate change was barely mentioned at the event even though the collection of the richest countries, which includes coal-mad China, collectively spew out some 80 per cent of global greenhouse gases, and their emissions are rising. Since the first COP in 1995, emissions are up by more than a third. There is no high-profile credible voice any more to warn about the existential threats of relentless global warming. Al Gore, a former U.S. vice-president who was co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his climate activism, was the last heavyweight on the global climate stage. Powerful money managers such as BlackRock and State Street are rolling back their ESG – environmental, social and governance – fund offerings while their bosses rarely utter the term “ESG” any more. Why is this happening even as the 1.5-degree goal appears to be wishful thinking and 2-degree warming seems inevitable? The European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service last summer said that global average temperatures reached or exceeded 1.5 C above preindustrial levels every month between July, 2023, and last June. At 2 degrees, scientists have warned that coral reefs will disappear, ice-free Arctic summers will become common, ocean levels will rise by more than half a metre (which would flood coastal cities) and storms, heat waves and droughts will become extreme, putting hundreds of millions of people – or more – in danger of chronic water scarcity and potentially making parts of the planet uninhabitable. The rise of the right-wing parties certainly is propelling the climate retreat. U.S. president-elect Donald Trump is embracing a “drill, baby, drill” agenda and has promised to terminate what he called President Joe Biden’s Green New Deal once Mr. Trump enters the White House later this month. During his first term as president, he pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement and killed or diluted a dollop of climate regulations. His pick for energy secretary, oil industry executive Chris Wright, said last year, “There is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition, either.” The story is similar elsewhere. In Italy, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called the European Union’s 2035 target to end the sale of internal combustion engine cars “self-destructive” because it would hand the death sentence to the traditional European auto industry, with almost 14 million employees, according to EU data. In Argentina, President Javier Milei, an admirer of Mr. Trump who is often referred to as a right-wing libertarian, has called climate change a “socialist lie.” He downgraded the environment ministry, boycotted COP29 and is pursuing a pro-mining and pro-drilling campaign. In Germany, conservative Opposition leader Friedrich Merz, who is on course to win a February snap election, has pledged to downgrade Germany’s ambitious climate policies. Green parties have lost ground in European elections. The era that saw millions of protesters take to the streets to demand action to fight climate change seems over. Sales of electric vehicles are slowing. Yet climate hypocrisy is alive and well in Europe. For instance, some of the same politicians who support the demise of gasoline and diesel cars also favour punishing tariffs on cheap imported Chinese EVs. The EU does make EVs, but most models are unaffordable to average families. Without inexpensive EVs, the EU’s net-zero goals will be hard to meet. The rise of the right means that the climate agenda will almost certainly stay in reverse – all the more so if voters in the West decide that tight emission controls will only transfer manufacturing jobs to China. As far as most Westerners are concerned, climate disasters happen to someone else. Only when the pain and misery come close to home will the picture change. In recent history, it was extreme and deadly emergencies that triggered quick corrective action. The COVID-19 pandemic saw vaccines produced in record time, for example. With the planet warming rapidly, the climate emergency is bound to come soon, as Ms. Thunberg had warned.

Title: Why Performance Chasing Is an Investing Error
URL: https://www.acepnow.com/article/why-performance-chasing-is-an-investing-error/?singlepage=1
Time Published: 2025-01-04T07:30:00Z
Full Content:
I’m now eligible for my 401(k), and I need to pick which mutual funds to invest my contributions into. I’m not sure exactly how to do this, but I can see which ones had the best returns over the last one, three, and five years, so I just thought I’d put all my money into the top two or three of them so I’m diversified. Is that the right approach? “Performance chasing” is widely recognized by behavioral economists as a serious investing error. In fact, it’s such a bad idea that mutual funds are required by law to include a statement in their paperwork saying something to the effect that past performance is no guarantee of future results. I wish the statement were even stronger, saying something like, “Outsized past performance is highly likely to reverse in the near future.” But, alas, investing is a caveat emptor activity. Performance chasing is easy to do. It is often driven by FOMO—fear of missing out. We hear about our friends making money in ARK funds, meme stocks, Beanie Babies, or Bitcoin and pile in, only to suffer through the inevitable downturn inherent in popular investment booms. At that point, fear of loss usually kicks in and we sell low. “Buy high and sell low” is not a recipe for investment success. The truth is that the outperformance of a few mutual funds in your 401(k) is far more likely due to what they invest in than the skill of their managers. For example, over the last five to 10 years, U.S. stocks have generally outperformed international stocks, bonds, and real estate, especially the large cap “growth” and “tech” stocks, like NVIDIA, Meta (Facebook), Amazon, and Alphabet (Google). So any mutual fund that was invested heavily in those stocks will demonstrate excellent results over the last few years, no matter what their investment strategy. Chances are, the top two or three funds in your 401(k) are all invested in those same types of stocks, and buying three funds that all invest in the same stocks is just false diversification. The data are very clear that the outperformance of active mutual fund managers does not persist. Well, it may, but only among the worst ones. Some studies show that the top quintile of managers for a given year are no more likely to be in the top quintile the next year than any other manager, but the bottom quintile managers are actually more likely to be in the bottom quintile the next year. Sometimes their funds simply close and disappear from the historical record. A more recent study by the mutual fund gurus at Morningstar concluded: Over the long term, there is no meaningful relationship between past and future fund performance. In most cases, the odds of picking a future long-term winner from the best-performing quintile in each category aren’t materially different than selecting from the bottom quintile. The results strongly indicate that long-term investors should not select funds based on past performance alone. As a rule, the more you pay for an investment, the worse its future returns will be. If you can buy a rental property with a net income of $20,000 for $200,000, that will probably be a great investment. Not so much if you pay $600,000 for that same property. That’s exactly what is happening when you buy any other investment after a recent run-up in price. You’re paying more for every dollar of earnings it generates, and thus your return must be lower than that of an investor who bought it at a lower price. Any student of the markets will quickly see that there is a pendulum effect as different types of investments come in and out of favor. Sometimes growth stocks do well. Sometimes value stocks do well. Sometimes small stocks or Chinese stocks or utility stocks do well. Sometimes bonds or real estate perform well. Predicting which will do best in the near future is extraordinarily difficult. In my opinion, it’s so difficult that it is probably not worth trying to do so. Certainly, there is no evidence that just buying whatever did best in the last year, three years, or even five years is going to lead to investment success. But doing the opposite isn’t any more successful; you can’t just take a contrarian approach and buy whatever did most poorly last year, either. Sometimes stocks have gone down in value for a reason—because the company is en route to bankruptcy. Perhaps if it recovers, you will make out like a bandit by buying low. The company behind the stock often does not rebound; good or bad performance may persist longer than expected. So what should an investor do if they can’t just pick the best performing funds out of their 401(k)? How about creating a reasonable, written investment plan instead? Determine a priori how much of the portfolio will be invested into U.S. stocks, international stocks, bonds, real estate, and other investments. Then look “under the hood” at what the available funds in your 401(k) actually invest in and choose them based on the underlying investments. Among funds that invest in similar investments, the best predictor of future performance is low costs, so choose the one with the lowest expenses. These will usually be index funds. If you need help doing so, consider hiring a fiduciary, fee-only financial planner who provides good advice at a fair price. While this stuff is not that hard to learn, the consequences of doing it poorly (or not doing it at all) compound over time. It may be well worth paying a few thousand dollars to get started on the right foot. Alternatively, come to the ACEP-sponsored workshop the Saturday prior to ACEP24 in Las Vegas, and I’ll help you walk through the process of writing your own financial plan. Whatever you do, don’t just buy the hottest performing stock, mutual fund, or other investment available—that approach does not necessarily lead to long-term investing success.

Title: The Woes Of The 155th: A French-Trained Brigade's Problems Highlight Bigger Ukrainian Difficulties
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2025/01/ukraine-250103-rferl03.htm

By Yevhenia Kytaiva-Rusetska, Nataliia Semenova, Zoriana Stepanenko and Mike Eckel January 03, 2025 It was supposed to be at the vanguard of a modernized Ukrainian Army, trained in Western tactics by French instructors, armed with Western weaponry, equipped to take on a bigger Russian Army on the battlefield. That hasn't happened. Instead, the Ukrainian military's 155th Separate Mechanized Brigade has been roiled by desertions, incriminations, and now, scathing public criticism accusing commanders of incompetence. The brigade's commander was abruptly replaced last month just after the unit returned from training in France, and Ukraine's lead law enforcement agency is investigating reports that dozens, possibly hundreds, of its soldiers have gone AWOL, or absent without leave. The 155th's problems have burst into the open at a wrenching time for Ukraine, with its population exhausted from nearly three years of full-scale war and its military exhausted from relentless Russian offensives. The problems, and the public venting, also illustrate the wider issues that have plagued Ukraine's military for months, if not years -- and, experts say, have hampered its ability to wage an effective full-scale defense, or offense, against a larger, better-equipped Russian force. "The training that I imagined should happen in the third year of war, what it should have been like, is not there," one lieutenant, currently on unauthorized leave from the brigade, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service." "I, for one, do not know what I am supposed to do. I'm not ready to give up and execute any orders with untrained people. Plus, I'm untrained myself. I command 30-something people. I'm not ready to risk their lives." "In France, I was taught absolutely nothing," said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity since public criticism of the military can result in criminal prosecution. At least 59 soldiers from the brigade left the training grounds in France without authorization, the officer said, a figure that was echoed by Yuriy Butusov, a popular Ukrainian war correspondent who described the brigade as "complete organizational chaos." In an interview, Butusov said the decision behind the brigade's training and formation were more political than anything. "There is simply no point in creating such brigades that are not fully staffed, that have no time at all to train, as we see," he told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service. "If we say we need a new brigade, then this is a matter that should take at least a year to complete. In addition to individual training, we need to ensure management at many levels." Inevitable Chaos? Western allies have poured billions of dollars into weaponry and equipment for Ukraine's armed forces, equipping them with modern technology to fight a bigger Russian Army with more weaponry as its disposal. They also sought to retrain Ukraine's armed forces, moving them away from the doctrine and tactics that its senior Soviet-trained officer corps grew up on, and introducing NATO-style thinking, such as combined arms warfare and emphasizing smaller brigades, rather than larger divisions. But aside from weaponry, Ukraine also faced a bigger problem: manpower. Critics in and out of Ukraine grumbled that Ukrainian authorities were failing to build a sustainable system of recruitment, mobilization, and training, to replenish depleted units. Ukrainian command created several new brigades. Some units were sent to Germany for training. Another unit was set up in France last year to great fanfare: the 155th Separate Mechanized Brigade was dubbed the "Anne of Kyiv" Brigade, named for an 11th century Kyiv princess who later became Queen of France. French President Emmanuel Macron announced the unit's creation during anniversary celebrations for the World War II Normandy invasion in June. Two months later, about 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers -- about the half the size of a standard NATO brigade -- were sent to France for training that included instruction on advanced French weapons systems; Macron later paid a highly publicized visit to the unit in October. When the 155th began rotating back to Ukraine in late November, Ukrainian forces had already been struggling for months trying to stave off accelerating Russian offensives in multiple places across the roughly 1,100-kilometer front line. On December 12, the brigade's commander, Colonel Dmytro Ryumshin, was replaced, just days before it was supposed to head into combat. The reason for Ryumshin's dismissal was unclear, but he posted a statement on the brigade's Facebook page thanking the unit's soldiers and officers for their "loyalty and professionalism." Days earlier, lawmaker Maryana Bezuhla criticized how the brigade was conceived, saying it was patched together haphazardly from other units, which in turn deprived other units of troop strength. "What happened to the 155th: even though the French attempted to make the brigade specialized, it wasn't spared from stupid military decisions, which tore the unit apart," she wrote on Facebook. "Within the brigade chaos reigns." That was echoed by Serhiy Sternenko, an activist and blogger who writes about public corruption and was previously affiliated with a far-right paramilitary group. "Why create a new brigade when the existing brigades were critically understaffed, if it was then divided up to assign people to the old brigades? What's the point?" Sternenko said in a post to X. "In addition to the blow to our image in French eyes, where part of the brigade was trained and equipped with equipment, we again suffered high losses and exhaustion." "This madness must be stopped before it completely undermines the army's ability to organize resistance," he wrote. 'I'd Rather Go AWOL' Despite the reported organizational problems, the brigade has deployed in part to help in the defense of Pokrovsk, a Donbas city that is under major threat of encirclement by Russian forces. Reports say the unit fielded German-made Leopard tanks and French artillery. But the brigade lieutenant who spoke to RFE/RL on condition of anonymity said some equipment they were provided was broken; excavators, for example, used to dig trenches and defenses. He also described some of the problems with command orders. "When we returned from France, some part of the brigade was already near Pokrovsk," he said. "Then we received an order to transfer to the infantry, and a lot of people went AWOL. Days later, we were sent to the Dnipropetrovsk region. And the next day, we received an order to go to a settlement 20 kilometers from the front line. "My commander wrote to me: 'Gather nine people. Tomorrow you're going to a specific place.' I asked him what we were supposed to do there. He said: 'I don't know'," the lieutenant said. "That is, the commanders are unprofessional, they haven't trained people." He said some soldiers think "I'd rather go AWOL. If I get caught, then at least, sooner or later, the prison door will open. The lid of a coffin will never open." Unconfirmed reports suggest that the brigade has suffered disproportionate casualties in the defense of Pokrovsk, something Butusov said was significant. "Most of the 155th soldiers on the front line are trying to fulfill their duties honestly," Butusov wrote in his December 31 Facebook post. "But due to a certain criminal attitude toward soldiers' lives, the 155th Brigade has suffered significant losses from the very first days" of deployment. Another brigade soldier, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said Butusov's criticism was largely true but was incomplete. "The situation with the formation was even worse than he described," the soldier said. The State Bureau of Investigation, Ukraine's lead law investigative agency, confirmed to RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service that it was investigating the reports of soldiers deserting. A brigade press officer declined to comment. Asked about the brigade's problems, France's presidential office, Elysee Palace, referred the question to the French Defense Ministry. "It was the Ukrainian Armed Forces that organized the selection of Ukrainian military personnel to form this brigade and manage the processes," the ministry said. "Also...the Ukrainian Armed Forces determine the conditions for the [brigade's] deployment in Ukraine."

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article US spot Bitcoin ETFs raked in $908 million in net inflows on Friday, rebounding from Thursday’s $242 million outflow, according to data from Farside Investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) netted $253 million, ending a three-day negative streak that saw $392 million in losses. The fund’s total net inflows recovered to $37 million, with holdings of 548,506 Bitcoin valued at $53.4 billion. Fidelity’s Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led Friday’s gains with $357 million in net inflows—one of its strongest daily performances since launch. FBTC has accumulated over $12 billion in new investments as of January 3. The ARKB fund, managed by ARK Invest and 21Shares, recorded $222 million in net inflows. Bitwise, Grayscale (BTC), and VanEck funds also posted gains, while other ETF providers reported no flows. Bitcoin reached $98,900 on Friday, surpassing $98,000 for the first time since December 26, CoinGecko data shows. The digital asset currently trades above $98,000, showing a 4% increase over the past week. Analysts predict a bullish year for Bitcoin, driven by growing institutional and national adoption. Galaxy Research forecasts five Nasdaq 100 companies and five nations will add Bitcoin to their balance sheets in 2025 to diversify their portfolio and meet their trade settlement needs. The firm also projects US spot Bitcoin ETFs will reach $250 billion in assets under management. Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck, recommends that investors increase their holdings in Bitcoin and gold through 2025, as these assets offer valuable protection against inflation, fiscal uncertainty, and global de-dollarization trends. Van Eck projects Bitcoin could reach $150,000 to $170,000. This stance is supported by other financial analysts and institutions recognizing Bitcoin’s potential to hedge against financial risks.

Full Content:
1. Who will win the GAA All-Ireland titles in football (men and women), hurling and camogie? Tyrone in the men’s and Galway in ladies football. In hurling Limerick (scared to see how big the bounce back will be) and Cork for the Camogie. 2. The British and Irish Lions head Down Under for the Test series. How many Irish players will be on Andy Farrell’s team? Who will win, the Lions or Australia? Thirteen Irish players in match day squad for first Test. Australia are making improvements but Andy Farrell’s men to get the job done. 3. Ireland’s soccer team has been drawn in a World Cup qualifying group alongside Portugal or Denmark, Hungary and Armenia. Have they any chance of making it out of the group? Which player has the potential to make it happen? It’s the first week of January so the hope is still burning in me. There’s a slim chance. Caoimhín Kelleher and Troy Parrott to lead the way at both ends of the pitch. 4. Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? Europe to cause an upset and a huge New York-based Irish crowd will be there cheering on Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry. 5. What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? PDC Darts Final at the Ally Pally. 6. If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? Soccer: A minimum shin guard size to be mandated that’s bigger than a match stick box. 7. One to watch in the sporting year ahead Erin King. Ireland women’s rugby team to kick on and make waves at the World Cup. 1. Who will win the GAA All-Ireland titles in football (men and women), hurling and camogie? In men’s football Kerry, women’s football also Kerry. Cork for a hurling and camogie double. 2. The British and Irish Lions head Down Under for the Test series. How many Irish players will be on Andy Farrell’s team? Who will win, the Lions or Australia? Australia will win the first game then the Lions will win the second Test and the series. 10 Irish players to make the squad with Bundie Aki, Andrew Porter, Dan Sheehan, Tadhg Furlong, Caelan Doris and Jamison Gibson Park to start. 3 Ireland’s soccer team have been drawn in a World Cup qualifying group alongside Portugal or Denmark, Hungary and Armenia. Have they any chance of making it out of the group? Which player has the potential to make it happen? This is a group that Ireland can get out of if they are ready to take advantage of opportunities that come their way. It won’t be easy and they will rely on Caoimhín Kelleher to make it happen. 4 Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? Two Irish players, Shane Lowry and Rory McIlroy. It will be close and the USA will likely hold on to win but Europe won’t give up without a tough battle. 5 What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? Dream ticket would be to The Ryder Cup to see Shane Lowry on the final green claim the winning point for Europe. 6 If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? Not to have pacemakers at every Diamond League meeting and limit the athletes to three per country in each race. 7 One to watch in the sporting year ahead Gout Gout, the teenage Australian 200 metre runner. Kevin Kilbane – 110 caps for the Republic of Ireland, football columnist 1 Who will win the GAA All-Ireland titles in football (men and women), hurling and camogie? Kerry will be strong but I’ll go for Donegal; Michael Murphy’s return and the new rules to benefit Jim McGuinness’s team. In hurling, Limerick to put the disappointment of last year aside and win Liam MacCarthy. In women’s football Kerry to repeat in 2025. In camogie, Cork. 2 The British and Irish Lions head Down Under for the Test series. How many Irish players will be on Andy Farrell’s team? Who will win, the Lions or Australia? Andy Farrell will be damned if he picks his own players and damned if he doesn’t but I can easily see nine or 10 featuring in the first Test. Lions to prevail. 3 Ireland’s soccer team has been drawn in a World Cup qualifying group alongside Portugal or Denmark, Hungary and Armenia. Have they any chance of making it out of the group? Which player has the potential to make it happen? Yes, Ireland have a chance and that’s precisely the attitude Heimir Hallgrimsson seems to be adopting but we all know we’re up against it. If we’re to qualify, Caoimhín Kelleher has to turn in some big performances. With more game time, I’m convinced Evan Ferguson can fulfil his huge potential. 4 Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? Two players. Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry. USA win on home soil. 5 What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? I’d love to go to the Masters. Imagine walking the back nine on a Sunday with Rory and Shane both on the Leaderboard. 6 If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? Easy one. Diving, play acting and cheating in football. It’s gone on too long it has now just become ‘part of the game’. 7 One to watch in the sporting year ahead Ruben Amorim. The Man United drama continues. Does he have the ability and courage to turn Man United around? One of the biggest stories to watch in 2025. Denis Walsh – feature writer and columnist 1 Who will win the GAA All-Ireland titles in football (men and women), hurling and camogie? Cork in hurling, Donegal in football. Galway in camogie and women’s football. 2 The British and Irish Lions head Down Under for the Test series. How many Irish players will be on Andy Farrell’s team? Who will win, the Lions or Australia? Five Irish players on the Test team: Caelan Doris, Hugo Keenan, Andrew Porter, Dan Sheehan and Tadhg Beirne. The Lions will win the Test series in a whitewash. 3 Ireland’s soccer team has been drawn in a World Cup qualifying group alongside Portugal or Denmark, Hungary and Armenia. Have they any chance of making it out of the group? Which player has the potential to make it happen? The chances of qualifying are close to nil. If Evan Ferguson gets a loan move in the second half of the season – ideally a confidence-boosting spell in the Championship – he could still be the catalyst for better days ahead. 4 Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? The United States will win. Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry will be the only Irish players. It is too soon for Tom McKibben while Seamus Power was playing better at this stage of the last Ryder Cup cycle. 5 What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? The Open at Portrush – if it wasn’t on the same weekend as the All-Ireland hurling final. Which it is. 6 If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? Root out the Saudi money and influence. They have sport held by the throat. 7 One to watch in the sporting year ahead Alan Connolly, the Cork hurling full-forward, showed flashes this year of his goalscoring sorcery. He will only get better. Gavin Cummiskey – soccer correspondent 1 Who will win the GAA All-Ireland titles in football (men and women), hurling and camogie? Dublin double in football after Brian Fenton un-retires, Limerick to strike back in hurling and a Cork camogie three-in-a-row. 2 The British and Irish Lions head Down Under for the Test series. How many Irish players will be on Andy Farrell’s team? Who will win, the Lions or Australia? Eleven Irish starters for the first Test. Hugo Keenan, Garry Ringrose, Bundee Aki, Sam Prendergast and Jamison Gibson Park in the backline; Caelan Doris, Josh van der Flier, Joe McCarthy, Andrew Porter, Tadhg Furlong and Dan Sheehan in the pack. Joe Schmidt to engineer one win for the Wallabies but Lions to take series 2-1. 3 Ireland’s soccer team has been drawn in a World Cup qualifying group alongside Portugal or Denmark, Hungary and Armenia. Have they any chance of making it out of the group? Which player has the potential to make it happen? Hungary and Portugal/Denmark will aim to take six points off the Republic of Ireland. To make a play-off, Evan Ferguson needs to evolve into a prime Zlatan Ibrahimović. At least Heimir-ball has nine months to take hold. 4 Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry. European banter and bonding to help engineer a crushing defeat of Team USA that brings the entire Ryder Cup Inc into question. 5 What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? Witnessing Ireland qualify for the World Cup as group winners by beating Hungary in Budapest on November 16th would do just fine. 6 If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? Introduce a 30-second shot-clock to Gaelic football when the attacking team crosses halfway. Force players to create scores under pressure. Problem solved. 7 One to watch in the sporting year ahead Mason Melia. Hopefully this sturdy 17-year-old reappears for St Patrick’s Athletic in February before a lucrative move abroad next summer. Brian O’Connor – racing correspondent 1 Who will win the GAA All-Ireland titles in football (men and women), hurling and camogie? Cork to win the hurling – at last! Dublin to get back on the horse in football. Cork for Camogie and a nice synchronicity then to Dublin in the football. 2 The British and Irish Lions head Down Under for the Test series. How many Irish players will be on Andy Farrell’s team? Who will win, the Lions or Australia? Let’s say eight, and with so many Irish in opposition, there will be no more motivated Aussie team with Joe Schmidt in charge. Home win. 3 Ireland’s soccer team has been drawn in a World Cup qualifying group alongside Portugal or Denmark, Hungary and Armenia. Have they any chance of making it out of the group? Which player has the potential to make it happen? Ireland look long shots. Hopes could be pinned to a rejuvenated Evan Ferguson. 4 Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? Two – McIlroy and Lowry. Another home win. 5 What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? After a mammoth 20-year gap, Cork finally winning the hurling in Croke Park. 6 If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? Recognition by the powers in Irish racing that government money can be used for the sport’s structural improvement rather than just pouring it into prize money. 7 One to watch in the sporting year ahead Red Letter won just one from three as a two-year-old. But as a physical type, Ger Lyons’s Frankel filly should only thrive with time. Enough perhaps to score at Group One level in 2025. Philip Reid – golf correspondent 1 Who will win the GAA All-Ireland titles in football (men and women), hurling and camogie? Tyrone look to have a fine influx of young players to mix in and could get their hands on Sam again while Dublin have the strength in depth to rebound and reclaim the Brendan Martin; in hurling, it’d be great to see Cork finally end their drought while, in camogie, the Rebels’ women can make it a three-in-a-row of titles and a double with the small ball for the Leesiders. 2 The British and Irish Lions head Down Under for the Test series. How many Irish players will be on Andy Farrell’s team? Who will win, the Lions or Australia? There were eight Irish on the 2021 touring squad so expect more this time with Andy Farrell in the coaching hot seat. 10 maybe (with Sam Prendergast as a wildcard)? Lions to win the series. 3 Ireland’s soccer team has been drawn in a World Cup qualifying group alongside Portugal or Denmark, Hungary and Armenia. Have they any chance of making it out of the group? Which player has the potential to make it happen? Realistically, the pathway to North America for 2026 must be through the playoffs. I can’t see Ireland topping the group – regardless of whether it’s Portugal or Denmark with top seeding – so it will be a target to finish second. For that to happen, Evan Ferguson has to be fit and scoring and hopefully Chiedozie Ogbene will be back. 4 Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? Well you can pencil Rory McIlroy in straight away so it will be a matter of Shane Lowry or Tom McKibbin doing enough to join him. Lowry has two Ryder Cups behind him and fully justified his captain’s pick from Luke Donald in Rome so just has to keep doing what he is doing and he should be in, either through qualifying off his own bat or a pick again. So, two Irish, but the US to win. 5 What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? I’ll be at the Ryder Cup and – working, fortunately, so don’t have to fork out the outrageously high admission price – that, from a golfing perspective, should be some occasion in New York. Other than that, the All-Ireland football final (with Dublin in it!!). 6 If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? As jaw-droppingly good as it is to see someone hit drives of 350 yards plus off the tee, the time has come for bifurcation of the golf ball in professional tournaments while leaving the golf ball as it is for amateurs. 7 One to watch in the sporting year ahead Tom McKibbin (again!), for a reason. He’s only just turned 22 but year on year has made the progression on a career path that has the makings of being something special. He’s graduated in turn from the Challenge Tour to the DP World Tour and in 2025 will play with a full PGA Tour card in the United States. His game (high ball flight, putting, temperament) bodes well for that next challenge. Gerry Thornley – rugby correspondent 1 Who will win the GAA All-Ireland titles in football (men and women), hurling and camogie? Galway to go one better in the men’s football, Kerry to retain their title in the ladies football, Clare to retain their crown in the hurling and Galway to win the camogie. 2 The British and Irish Lions head Down Under for the Test series. How many Irish players will be on Andy Farrell’s team? Who will win, the Lions or Australia? Maybe 14 Irish players in the travelling squad and eight in the match day 23. But that could be biased. And the Lions to roar Down Under! 3 Ireland’s soccer team has been drawn in a World Cup qualifying group alongside Portugal or Denmark, Hungary and Armenia. Have they any chance of making it out of the group? Which player has the potential to make it happen? Largely based on the convoluted and increased number of qualifying routes to the finals, Ireland probably have a better chance than has been the case for a while. If so, then Nathan Collins will surely be the rock on which the team is built. Sammie Szmodics looks a good, hard-working addition. 4 Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? Two, namely Rory and Shane. And, ugh, U-S-A!...U-S-A!...U-S-A!...U-S-A! 5 What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? The Champions League final, and especially if Arsenal are in it. Munich swings this one. Never been. 6 If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? The half-time or full-time TV analysis with studio pundits in rugby or football, and probably most sports, when all smug comments along the lines of “as we were saying beforehand” are outlawed, with repeat offenders to be imprisoned. Yes, we know this is your genius and this is why you have been hired, and the producers have told you to say this. 7 One to watch in the sporting year ahead The Connacht scrumhalf, Matthew Devine. Malachy Clerkin – member of Na Fianna GAA club 1 Who will win the GAA All-Ireland titles in football (men and women), hurling and camogie? Men’s football is a lucky dip until we see the new rules in action – possibly Donegal? Women’s football is ripe for a new name as well – maybe Armagh if the Mackins get back to full fitness. Men’s hurling will be all about Limerick getting their groove back – even without Nickie Quaid, I fancy them. Camogie will probably be Cork again. 2 The British and Irish Lions head Down Under for the Test series. How many Irish players will be on Andy Farrell’s team? Who will win, the Lions or Australia? There’ll presumably be plenty of Irishmen in the squad but I reckon the actual starting 15 will have fewer than people think. Four feels about right. They should win – Australia are getting better under Joe Schmidt but they’re still there for the taking. 3 Ireland’s soccer team has been drawn in a World Cup qualifying group alongside Portugal or Denmark, Hungary and Armenia. Have they any chance of making it out of the group? Which player has the potential to make it happen? There is no real evidence that success is just around the corner. It will come down to home and away fixtures against Hungary, most likely. Maybe Caoimhín Kelleher can see us into a play-off. That counts as getting out of the group, doesn’t it? 4 Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? Two – Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry will make it. The fact that it’s going to be such a bear pit means it probably comes a bit too soon for Tom McKibbin, although his first year on the PGA Tour is going to be worth watching. The Yanks will win. Nobody ever wins away any more. 5 What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? Olympic Stadium, Tokyo, Thursday September 18th. Women’s 400m final at the World Athletics Championship. Rhasidat Adeleke is going to be an unmissable part of every Irish sporting year for the next decade (hopefully). Time for her first senior world podium. 6 If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? I would find a way not to have to pay money to seven different companies to watch the sport that I want on my television. A floating sports fan needs to pay the TV licence, Sky, GAAGo, Premier Sports, Racing TV, Danz and Netflix these days just to keep up. No wonder dodgy boxes are all the rage. 7 One to watch in the sporting year ahead Sam Ewing looks set to be the main beneficiary of his friend Jack Kennedy’s terrible luck. Kennedy’s recent leg break – his sixth, incredibly – leaves Ewing with a great chance to be at the vanguard of Gordon Elliott’s spring campaign. Don’t rule out a tilt at the jockey’s title. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Alice: You saw GPT-2, right? Bob: Of course. Alice: It's running on GPUs using CUDA. OpenAI will keep scaling that up, and other groups will want to do the same thing. Bob: Right. Alice: So, does this mean we should buy Nvidia stock? Bob: I'm not sure. Nvidia makes the hardware used now, but why should we expect it to be the hardware used in the future? There's clearly room for improvement: current GPUs aren't optimized for lower-precision numbers or sparsity. Designs will change, which means a competitor might do better. At the scales we're talking about, it makes some sense to design your own ASICs. Google already has TPUs, and Amazon & Facebook will probably do something similar. Alice: OK, but researchers are all people who started out doing stuff on their personal GPU using CUDA. Bob: And you don't think AMD or somebody will be able to make other GPUs compatible with CUDA, now that it's a priority? Alice: Eventually, maybe, but I think you're massively underestimating the difficulty of that. Bob: Again, google is already using TPUs, so clearly they have software for that. Look, neural networks are mostly big matrix multiplications; chips for them should be easier to design than chips for graphics, and Nvidia has strong competition for GPUs. Alice: You want HBM for NN ASICs, and TSMC is the only company doing that well. Nvidia reserved a lot of their capacity. Bob: Apple did too. More importantly, if TSMC capacity is the limiting factor, then profits should go to them. There are contracts for now, but GPT-2 is still a ways off from being useful and it wouldn't make sense to make really big purchases until the next generation of ASICs comes out, at which point those contracts could be renegotiated and TSMC could raise their prices, up to the point where Samsung is almost as good an option. Alice: Hmm, maybe. I still think you're underestimating the software moat Nvidia has. Long-term, maybe there's a real competitor, but every big company is going to want to train their own language model ASAP. Bob: Why? I could understand fine-tuning, but why would they need to do that? I imagine there will be a few big groups making their own models, but then everybody else could just license the best ones. The competition should be even, meaning low net profits. There might even be competitive open-source models from somebody. Alice: No, big companies will want to make their own. You're not considering the incentives of people at those companies. If they think AI will be big, they'll want job experience "making AI". And CEOs will be afraid that markets will punish them for not having their own AI program, because investors will think experience with AI could be important in the future. Bob: What?! OpenAI has only been around for a few years! Corporate "experience" with AI won't matter; just hire decent people and read the latest papers. Alice: Maybe so, but that's not how a lot of investors think. Bob: Is that the basis of our investment plan, then? CEOs do something dumb to please dumb investors? Alice: You already said there's room for improvement with NN ASICs, right? Bob: Of course, you can [redacted]. But obviously a complete design is too large a project for just me. Alice: Well then, it seems you think there's room for them to continue improvements and stay ahead of other designers. Nvidia was leading for hardware acceleration of ray tracing, and they'll have a big budget, so it seems like they'll be leading for NN ASIC design too, at least for a while. Bob: I'm not convinced that such competence carries over to other designs. For all you know Apple or Amazon will do better than them. Or maybe Huawei, or Will Semiconductor. Alice: Even if that's true, you're looking too far ahead. Stock prices are based on profit in the last few quarters and the stories in media. There's a whole pipeline for this stuff, and it takes years. Also, Nvidia can afford to steal all the best GPU software people from AMD. Bob: Again, there are already TPUs. Alice: Fun fact, Nvidia is actually doing better in terms of NN performance per mm^2 than TPUs despite their processors being less special-purpose. Bob: OK, but presumably Google could still sell those if there's so much demand. Alice: Maybe Google just won't be able to make TPUs fast enough to sell them and do their own stuff. And maybe there just won't be much other strong competition in the relevant timeframe. Bob: Do all the best people want to work in Nvidia's giant open offices, then? It's not like they have a monopoly on talent; they certainly wouldn't hire me or [redacted]. Alice: Sure, but neither would the ASIC companies getting VC funding. If any ASIC startup actually becomes a threat, Nvidia can buy them out too. The Chinese talent pool is also somewhat separate, but then the Chinese companies have their geopolitical and management issues.

Title: The Last And The First

Once you subscribe, not only will you get the e-newsletter, but you will also get an ad-free experience and the opportunity to post comments on American Thinker content. The Bible resonates across the ages, always having something to say to us no matter what may have changed in the world as a whole. It’s as true in 2025 as it ever has been. So, we’ll contemplate the events of the past year or so through the lens of this passage from Matthew: “So the last will be first, and the first will be last.” We begin with that human colossus overshadowing the entire globe: Donald Trump. We all know the story, even as it transmutes into legend, something that will be told, retold, analyzed, disparaged, and rekindled for generations to come. Even as he reached out to his opposition, Trump, during his first term, was interfered with to an extent never before witnessed in a presidential administration. Taking advice from Chris Christie, of all people, keeping on Christopher Wray and Mark Milley, hiring establishment backstabbers like William Barr—it gained him nothing. He was assailed, undercut, and betrayed on all sides—and yet he still succeeded in fulfilling much of his agenda. They cheated him out of his rightfully earned second term in 2020, secure in the knowledge that nobody would ever figure it out. Then came the impeachments—two of them one after the other, as if they were aware, deep down, that one couldn’t possibly work. Followed by a slew of bogus lawsuits that should even now result in disbarments and unbenchings across the country. Image by AI. They assured themselves that they’d buried the boogieman deep at the crossroads. They were mistaken. All the same, they must have been delighted when he ran again in ‘24, meaning that the GOP had nobody capable of taking his place (no surprise there). They’d beaten him once. They had humiliated and disgraced him, tarnished his name, and threatened his family. They could do it again. That worked out well. The American Left, the media, and the Deep State blew it as completely as anyone has ever blown anything. Blew it through overconfidence, ineptness, and sheer demented inability to grasp the reality they were facing. They tossed all their cards over the cliff edge and then jumped after them, laughing all the way down. The July coup, the Harris time-bomb, the Walz selection, the attempt to run an aging call girl as a racial messiah… all of it wasted effort, all of it leading to the inevitable conclusion. All the while, Trump campaigned like a man possessed, running a schedule that would have broken most men half his age. Sitting before corrupt, vindictive Democrat judges in the morning, then hopping a plane to host a rally in the afternoon—and doing it over and over again, day after day, week after week. Nothing slowed him down, not even an assassin’s bullet. This is the class of event that we’re too close to for proper judgment. It was years after Midway before anybody grasped what that victory meant. It was a decade after Apollo XI before we began to understand what had been thrown away. The same is true here. We may not live long enough to see the final outcome of what transpired this year. The Dems, needless to say, will never get it, which is as it should be. We turn now to Ukraine. The bully-worshippers who bow down to a KGB agent who uses nerve gas and radioisotopes against his critics should probably sit this one out. Ukraine is a fragment of a former empire that has spent decades trying to find its feet—and failing. In the strictest sense, Putin wasn’t wrong. No sane military analysis would see Ukraine as anything but a basket case state that was just aching to be snatched up by the first comer. Putin didn’t even call it a “war.” No—it was a “special military operation.” It would take about three days. It’s clear that Putin was thinking in terms of Crete, 1941. There, the German Luftwaffe flew in Ju-52 transports packed with troops to Maleme airfield, many of them actually crash-landing on the runway. These took control of the field thanks to a British commander who pulled his troops out to “regroup” them (have to make sure those boots are properly shined, pip-pip). Within hours, the Germans had landed thousands of troops, and the Brits were finished. Putin tried the same thing, sending in a large transport stuffed with Spetnaz special forces to take over Kyiv’s airport. But that plane was shot down, killing hundreds of Russia’s finest troops. The rest of the Ilyushins never showed up. The tank columns were caught in an unseasonable Rasputitsa, and here we are, going on three years later. As classic an example of asymmetric warfare as you are likely to find. The Ukrainians, out of necessity, revolutionized warfare with the use of cheap drones to negate much more advanced and expensive weapons. Putin’s military was exposed as essentially a massive hoax, his “18,000 tanks in storage” suddenly turning into piles of rust and broken parts. He lost most of his Black Sea fleet to a country without a Navy. Putin was, in the end, forced to turn to Russia’s traditional “strategy” (to stretch the term to its utmost limits): wasting troops by the thousands to gain a few hundred yards of ground. Even if Ukraine were to surrender today, it would still be a Russian failure. Putin has succeeded in awakening a somnolent NATO, encouraging much greater spending on armaments, wrecking the ruble, destroying Russia’s credit, ramming the BRICs alliance onto the rocks, and not least, losing something on the order of 750,000 men. As for the putative reason for the war in the first place—to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO—both Sweden and Finland have joined the alliance after generations (centuries, in Sweden’s case)—of neutrality. So now Putin has one of the most technologically adept and the most ferocious peoples in Europe lined up against him. Well done, Vlad. Now, if they could only learn to keep their hands out of the till. We turn to Israel. A little over a year ago, Israel was mired in one of the worst situations of its short lifetime. Iran’s long-term plans were coming to fruition. Israel was surrounded by enemies, including the effective and well-armed terror groups, Hamas and Hezb’allah. Russia had established military bases less than an hour’s flight from Israel’s borders. The Houthis, armed by Iran, were prepared to cut off the Red Sea. Israeli-Arab conciliation through the Abraham Accords, mediated by Donald Trump, lay in a state of limbo. Iran was drawing ever closer to unveiling a working nuclear weapon. Anti-Semitism was surging worldwide, triggered by Western-based Islamist groups and encouraged by the likes of Barry Obama, Jimmy Carter, Roger Waters, and the Congressional Squad. The Biden administration had blatantly and openly betrayed the Jewish state on all possible levels. And today? Well…if the Jews aren’t actually God’s chosen people, they’ll do until one comes along. It can be safely said that the situation has not been so much reversed as turned inside out and then run through a Klein bottle. Hamas has been constricted to one single neighborhood, where it is relentlessly being attritted. Hezb’allah has been decapitated in one of the most brilliant covert espionage operations on record. Iran’s air defenses have been shattered, and it now awaits the inevitable crushing of its nuclear sites. Syria has collapsed, with much of its military weaponry and supplies destroyed by Israel and the U.S., while the Russian naval task forces based there have taken to their heels. So the first have become last. Trump was supposed to act as an object lesson to any who would defy the Dem/Soros/BlackRock leviathan. Ukraine was supposed to vanish like the morning dew.

We stand on the verge of a new age with infinite promise and wrenching terrors that may, in fact, lead to those “broad, sunlit uplands” that we were promised so many years ago.

Above all, we need to learn how to keep our chin up, how not to lose faith, how to take a bullet and come up fighting, and how to come out on top when all seems lost. And at last, because it is apt, because it is righteous, because it is true, we will end with another quote from the book on which our civilization is based: “The race does not always go to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but time and chance happeneth to them all.” This essay was originally published in our subscriber-only e-newsletter, a weekly compilation of original essays from American Thinker editors.

The Bible resonates across the ages, always having something to say to us no matter what may have changed in the world as a whole. It’s as true in 2025 as it ever has been. So, we’ll contemplate the events of the past year or so through the lens of this passage from Matthew: “So the last will be first, and the first will be last.” We begin with that human colossus overshadowing the entire globe: Donald Trump. We all know the story, even as it transmutes into legend, something that will be told, retold, analyzed, disparaged, and rekindled for generations to come. Even as he reached out to his opposition, Trump, during his first term, was interfered with to an extent never before witnessed in a presidential administration. Taking advice from Chris Christie, of all people, keeping on Christopher Wray and Mark Milley, hiring establishment backstabbers like William Barr—it gained him nothing. He was assailed, undercut, and betrayed on all sides—and yet he still succeeded in fulfilling much of his agenda. They cheated him out of his rightfully earned second term in 2020, secure in the knowledge that nobody would ever figure it out. Then came the impeachments—two of them one after the other, as if they were aware, deep down, that one couldn’t possibly work. Followed by a slew of bogus lawsuits that should even now result in disbarments and unbenchings across the country. Image by AI. They assured themselves that they’d buried the boogieman deep at the crossroads. They were mistaken. All the same, they must have been delighted when he ran again in ‘24, meaning that the GOP had nobody capable of taking his place (no surprise there). They’d beaten him once. They had humiliated and disgraced him, tarnished his name, and threatened his family. They could do it again. That worked out well. The American Left, the media, and the Deep State blew it as completely as anyone has ever blown anything. Blew it through overconfidence, ineptness, and sheer demented inability to grasp the reality they were facing. They tossed all their cards over the cliff edge and then jumped after them, laughing all the way down. The July coup, the Harris time-bomb, the Walz selection, the attempt to run an aging call girl as a racial messiah… all of it wasted effort, all of it leading to the inevitable conclusion. All the while, Trump campaigned like a man possessed, running a schedule that would have broken most men half his age. Sitting before corrupt, vindictive Democrat judges in the morning, then hopping a plane to host a rally in the afternoon—and doing it over and over again, day after day, week after week. Nothing slowed him down, not even an assassin’s bullet. This is the class of event that we’re too close to for proper judgment. It was years after Midway before anybody grasped what that victory meant. It was a decade after Apollo XI before we began to understand what had been thrown away. The same is true here. We may not live long enough to see the final outcome of what transpired this year. The Dems, needless to say, will never get it, which is as it should be. We turn now to Ukraine. The bully-worshippers who bow down to a KGB agent who uses nerve gas and radioisotopes against his critics should probably sit this one out. Ukraine is a fragment of a former empire that has spent decades trying to find its feet—and failing. In the strictest sense, Putin wasn’t wrong. No sane military analysis would see Ukraine as anything but a basket case state that was just aching to be snatched up by the first comer. Putin didn’t even call it a “war.” No—it was a “special military operation.” It would take about three days. It’s clear that Putin was thinking in terms of Crete, 1941. There, the German Luftwaffe flew in Ju-52 transports packed with troops to Maleme airfield, many of them actually crash-landing on the runway. These took control of the field thanks to a British commander who pulled his troops out to “regroup” them (have to make sure those boots are properly shined, pip-pip). Within hours, the Germans had landed thousands of troops, and the Brits were finished. Putin tried the same thing, sending in a large transport stuffed with Spetnaz special forces to take over Kyiv’s airport. But that plane was shot down, killing hundreds of Russia’s finest troops. The rest of the Ilyushins never showed up. The tank columns were caught in an unseasonable Rasputitsa, and here we are, going on three years later. As classic an example of asymmetric warfare as you are likely to find. The Ukrainians, out of necessity, revolutionized warfare with the use of cheap drones to negate much more advanced and expensive weapons. Putin’s military was exposed as essentially a massive hoax, his “18,000 tanks in storage” suddenly turning into piles of rust and broken parts. He lost most of his Black Sea fleet to a country without a Navy. Putin was, in the end, forced to turn to Russia’s traditional “strategy” (to stretch the term to its utmost limits): wasting troops by the thousands to gain a few hundred yards of ground. Even if Ukraine were to surrender today, it would still be a Russian failure. Putin has succeeded in awakening a somnolent NATO, encouraging much greater spending on armaments, wrecking the ruble, destroying Russia’s credit, ramming the BRICs alliance onto the rocks, and not least, losing something on the order of 750,000 men. As for the putative reason for the war in the first place—to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO—both Sweden and Finland have joined the alliance after generations (centuries, in Sweden’s case)—of neutrality. So now Putin has one of the most technologically adept and the most ferocious peoples in Europe lined up against him. Well done, Vlad. Now, if they could only learn to keep their hands out of the till. We turn to Israel. A little over a year ago, Israel was mired in one of the worst situations of its short lifetime. Iran’s long-term plans were coming to fruition. Israel was surrounded by enemies, including the effective and well-armed terror groups, Hamas and Hezb’allah. Russia had established military bases less than an hour’s flight from Israel’s borders. The Houthis, armed by Iran, were prepared to cut off the Red Sea. Israeli-Arab conciliation through the Abraham Accords, mediated by Donald Trump, lay in a state of limbo. Iran was drawing ever closer to unveiling a working nuclear weapon. Anti-Semitism was surging worldwide, triggered by Western-based Islamist groups and encouraged by the likes of Barry Obama, Jimmy Carter, Roger Waters, and the Congressional Squad. The Biden administration had blatantly and openly betrayed the Jewish state on all possible levels. And today? Well…if the Jews aren’t actually God’s chosen people, they’ll do until one comes along. It can be safely said that the situation has not been so much reversed as turned inside out and then run through a Klein bottle. Hamas has been constricted to one single neighborhood, where it is relentlessly being attritted. Hezb’allah has been decapitated in one of the most brilliant covert espionage operations on record. Iran’s air defenses have been shattered, and it now awaits the inevitable crushing of its nuclear sites. Syria has collapsed, with much of its military weaponry and supplies destroyed by Israel and the U.S., while the Russian naval task forces based there have taken to their heels. So the first have become last. Trump was supposed to act as an object lesson to any who would defy the Dem/Soros/BlackRock leviathan. Ukraine was supposed to vanish like the morning dew. Israel was to be subject to the Second Holocaust while the world shook its head and sighed. The last have become first. We stand on the verge of a new age with infinite promise and wrenching terrors that may, in fact, lead to those “broad, sunlit uplands” that we were promised so many years ago. The key now is to keep it going. We need to study how all this was done in order to ensure it continues being done.

Title: Defense Tech Scaling New Heights With Incoming Administration

Apex, a Shield Capital portfolio company, takes a selfie of its first space vehicle dubbed “Call to ... [+] Adventure” demonstrating its satellite subsystems working less than a year from design to satellite commissioning—the fastest deployment ever in its class. The recent run up in the stock market—especially for tech stocks—signals a stimulative business climate during the second Trump Administration which should fuel a continued rise for defense tech—the incorporation of new technologies such as AI, cyber, autonomy and space for military applications. The first Trump Administration saw an S&P 500 increase of 50%, a much larger tech stock increase of 138%, and 380% for the Magnificent 7 stocks. Looking forward, the combination of extended rate reductions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017), a lighter regulatory environment, and likely lower interest rates with easing inflation all create a positive economic outlook. This economic outlook provides fertile ground for gains in the defense tech sector which has already been one of the most promising areas for venture investors. Since 2021, venture investment in defense tech totals more than $100 billion, 40% more than the previous seven years combined. The factors driving increased investment are likely to intensify during the next four years: first, rising geopolitical tensions and, second, the technologies which militaries need are increasingly developed by the private sector rather than government labs. NEW YORK, NY - AUGUST 16: Wall St. and Broad St. signs are seen by the New York Stock Exchange ... [+] (NYSE) building in the financial district of New York City, United States on August 16, 2021. (Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) The first large-scale land war in Europe since World War II, renewed fighting in the Middle East, and China’s aggressive actions in the South China Sea all highlight simultaneous geopolitical conflicts. Further, America’s adversaries—China, Russia, Iran and North Korea—are collaborating more closely than ever in an axis of autocrats which enable them to combine strengths in their collective goal of weakening the United States. During Trump’s first term in office and most recent campaign, he advocated modernizing and strengthening our military. In this campaign, he began referring to the Reagan doctrine of “peace through strength” which recalls an era when the U.S. spent 6% of GDP on defense compared to today’s 3%—the lowest relative level in 75 years. The incoming chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Roger Wicker, is on record calling for a generational investment in defense spending at 5% of GDP. Military superiority now depends to a large degree on commercial technologies such as AI, autonomy, cyber, space, and others being used in military applications. The war in Ukraine has shown the power of these new technologies such as commercial satellite imagery, small aerial drones, and maritime autonomy which enabled Ukraine to sink or disable one-third of the Russian Fleet without a regular navy. In the last 50 years, there has been a dramatic shift in the drivers of military technology from government labs to consumers and businesses; consequently, venture funding has become the primary financing mechanism and is two to three times the size of the Defense Department’s R&D budget. The positive landscape for defense tech investing builds on several developments during the Biden Administration. The Defense Innovation Unit, created to deliver more commercial technology to the Pentagon, now has a $1 billion budget (up 8 times since I led it in 2022) and whose director now reports directly to the Secretary of Defense. The Office of Strategic Capital now has the authority to make up to $1 billion in loans for component technologies, like batteries or quantum computing, important for national security. Last year, the Deputy Secretary of Defense announced the Replicator initiative with the goal of delivering thousands of attritable autonomous systems within 18 months and said recently that the Department appears on track to do so. LONDON, ENGLAND - MARCH 12: A L3Harris IVER4 900 Autonomous Undersea Vehicle (AUV) / Unmanned ... [+] underwater vehicle (UUV) during the Oceanology International 2024 at ExCel on March 12, 2024 in London, England. The event is the global forum where ocean industry, academia and government connect to discover innovative solutions, from ocean technology, marine science communities, improving strategies for exploring, protecting and sustainably operating in the world's oceans and waterways. (Photo by John Keeble/Getty Images) In addition, the U.S. Space Force announced its commercial acquisition strategy to buy more data from new satellite constellations that provide multi-modal sensors and ever-faster revisit rates. The U.S. Army’s autonomy program is on track to begin producing the Remote Combat Vehicle in 2027 while the USAF is developing a manned-unmanned teaming concept known as Combat Collaborative Autonomy to complement fighter jets. AI, cyber, autonomy and space technology, which my firm—Shield Capital—invests in, are increasingly applied to national security uses and this means more opportunity for a wider set of commercial vendors. In addition to the technology adoption, the Department has produced several studies on the defense industrial base including the first Industrial Strategy Implementation Plan and Supply Chain Risk Management, both of which identify the increased concentration of suppliers as a national security risk. There is a growing consensus that the supply base must broaden beyond the prime vendors which will create opportunities for more vendors. Given the importance of incorporating new technologies, growing the supply base and scaling new capabilities more quickly, there is tremendous upside for venture-backed companies which today supply only 1% of defense procurement. Some question whether the Department of Government Efficiency will dampen these trends. I believe this is highly doubtful since procurement was only 21% of the fiscal 2024 defense budget. There are richer opportunities for efficiency and reductions in the personnel budget (26% of the budget) and the maintenance of older ships, tanks and planes (35% of the budget). For example, staff positions in the Army have grown 40% since 9/11. Criticism of military procurement is likely to focus on the trillion-dollar programs such as the F-35 or Ford-class carriers. To modernize military capabilities as the U.S. did during the Reagan years means procuring newer technologies and weapons systems to replace aging fleets. CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA - MAY 06: A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off from Launch Complex 40 at Cape ... [+] Canaveral Space Force Station on May 06, 2024 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket is carrying 23 Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) As a result, I believe DOGE will accelerate the trends fueling defense tech. Elon Musk will be a proponent of fixed-price contracts rather than the cost-plus approach of defense primes. A great example of a fixed-price contract is SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket development which was only 10% of NASA’s projected development cost. Additionally, many of the designees for key positions in national security in the new Administration are from business or venture capital backgrounds, similar to DOGE leadership, and are likely to bring a reform mindset of doing things differently and incorporating more private sector incentives like fixed-price contracts. Rising geopolitical tensions, increasing use of commercial technologies in military applications, the growing need to diversify the defense supply base and the priorities of the incoming Trump Administration combine to create a better outlook than ever before for defense tech. These underlying trends will certainly benefit the defense unicorns such as SpaceX, Anduril and Palantir but they will also lead the way for an ever-growing set of new suppliers like Apex, Danti and Code Metal—three Shield Capital investments. Code Metal’s customer, Tigris Systems, benefits by the rapid deployment of AI algorithms to ... [+] intelligent edge sensor networks to ensure more reliable and predictable global transportation of goods. In the Cold War, Silicon Valley technologies helped make us more secure as a nation; history is repeating itself but with a whole new set of technologies and vendors which will equip our warfighters with the best the nation has to offer. Modernizing our force and expanding our warfighter capabilities from a greater number of suppliers will elevate defense tech to new heights. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Dumps $2,500,000,000 Portfolio, Pours Millions Into New Asset: Report

Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is exploring new opportunities after dumping more than $2.5 billion in stocks. The famed investor and head of Duquesne Family Office sold all of the firm’s shares of Nvidia (NVDA) last year, along with nearly all of the firm’s stake in Palantir (PLTR). Now, Druckenmiller is beginning to pour some of the firm’s massive cash stockpile into Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), buying 1,427,950 shares worth about $30.3 million, reports the Motley Fool. The stock surged more than 100% in 2024, as the company settled opioid litigation and reported strong growth after centering its efforts on brand-name drugs. As of Q3 2024, the top holdings at Duquesne Family Office include Natera (NTRA) worth $452 million, Coupang (CPNG) valued at $287 million, Coherent (COHR) at $264 million, Woodward (WWD) at $181 million and Seagate Technology (STX) at $179 million. In a recent interview with Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, Druckenmiller said his top concern is whether the Federal Reserve started cutting rates too soon. “When this whole inflationary episode started, and I’d say two years ago or a year and a half ago, I was very confident that inflation was going to come down, which I was right on. But I was worried about the economy, which I was completely wrong on. You can take this with a grain of salt since I had one right and one wrong there, I’ve switched to being more worried about inflation going forward than the economy itself. I’m a little worried that the Fed has declared victory too early. I don’t have conviction like I had in 2021 that inflation was going to go up, that’s when the money supply was growing 40% and all sorts of things were happening. But I also don’t have conviction that they’ve snuffed this thing out and won the battle.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: FAIR: Why Didn’t NYT Tell Us What Ben Smith Stood to Gain From His Media Reporting?

FAIRNESS & ACCURACY IN REPORTING Challenging media bias since 1986. FAIR FAIR is the national progressive media watchdog group, challenging corporate media bias, spin and misinformation. Announcing their hiring of Ben Smith, New York Times editors (1/28/20) declared, “Ben not only understands the seismic changes remaking media, he has lived them — and in some cases, led them.” In a time of downsizing and consolidation, Ben Smith has had a journalistic career many would envy. He became famous as the editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News, and is co-founder and editor-in-chief of Semafor, a rising media giant that raised $19 million last year. (This “replac[ed] the money it had received from the disgraced cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman-Fried,” the New York Times reported—5/24/23). These two adventures bookend his two-year stint as the “Media Equation” columnist at the New York Times, from March 2020 through January 2022. During his entire tenure there, Smith held an undisclosed amount of stock options in BuzzFeed, creating a conflict of interest for him and the Times, which both consistently waved away (Slate, 10/15/21). “Under New York Times policy, I can’t write about BuzzFeed extensively until I divest stock options in the company,” Smith explained on several occasions (here 9/26/21). But from his influential perch, Smith did, of necessity, cover BuzzFeed’s competitors, frequently critically, putting his investment’s rivals and potential rivals in a bad light. Buzzfeed started out as pure internet culture, a website offering entertainment and quizzes. But it expanded into hard news, thus competing with others in that new media mold, like the nodes of the Gawker empire. Smith’s stake in BuzzFeed exceeded $7 million, according to FAIR’s sources—a strikingly large material interest in a company whose competitors Smith regularly covered, underscoring the ethical concerns about both Smith’s coverage and the Times’ willingness to ignore its own ethical guidelines. With a considerable financial stake in online media, Ben Smith could have different reasons from the rest of us for freaking out about Substack (New York Times, 4/11/21). Smith (New York Times, 10/17/21) covered sexual harassment allegations at Axel Springer as the Berlin-based multimedia company was looking to grow its footprint in the US media market—making it a potential competitor to BuzzFeed. In a critical piece (New York Times, 4/11/21) about the self-publishing platform Substack, which includes heavy investment from venture capitalist and Trump supporter Marc Andreessen, Smith wrote: Substack has courted a number of Times writers. I turned down an offer of an advance well above my Times salary, in part because of the editing and the platform the Times gives me, and in part because I didn’t think I’d make it back—media types often overvalue media writers. Smith appears to be putting his cards on the table here, but readers have no way of knowing that his financial interest in BuzzFeed far eclipsed the salary he was getting from the Times or was offered by Substack, a new media product that competed against the very company, BuzzFeed, he was invested in. Smith (New York Times, 4/18/21) also pooh-poohed Bustle’s growth with Mic and Nylon, and its eye on restarting Gawker, in part because Bustle bet on advertising revenue, which Smith maintained was destined to flow overwhelmingly to Google and Facebook (later rebranded as Meta). A month later, Bustle rebranded in preparation for its IPO (Axios, 5/11/21)—an initial public offering to investors. A month after that, Hollywood Reporter (6/30/21) noted that BuzzFeed was one of a number of media companies, including Bustle, that were looking to go public in order to shore up investments. Once again, readers should have had a clear understanding that Smith was writing about an entity that was competing for venture capital with the outlet he had major holdings in. A story by Smith in the New York Times (9/26/21) contributed to the downfall of the media startup Ozy—a company that Buzzfeed under Smith’s leadership considered buying. The most interesting example of Smith’s conflict of interest is the case of Ozy Media. Carlos Watson, a former MSNBC and CNN anchor, attracted lots of attention when he launched Ozy, raising $5.3 million in its early days (Venture Capital Post, 12/28/13), reaching up to an enormous $20 million investment from Axel Springer (USA Today, 10/6/24). Watson and his media child were riding high—for a time. Smith (New York Times, 9/26/21) was the first journalist to raise questions about the veracity of Ozy’s claims to investors. Less than two years later, Watson was arrested for fraud (Wall Street Journal, 2/23/23), and the operation was no more (Variety, 3/1/23). He and the company were ultimately found guilty in a New York City federal court earlier this year, “in a case accusing them of lying to investors about the now-defunct startup’s finances and sham deals with Google and Oprah Winfrey” (Reuters, 7/16/24). He was sentenced to 10 years in prison (AP, 12/16/24). Smith’s reporting on Ozy was considered momentous, leading to the downfall of a high-flying media startup. But Smith was not a disinterested journalist when he went after Watson and Ozy. Late last year, Ozy sued Smith, BuzzFeed and Semafor for allegedly stealing Ozy’s trade secrets (Reuters, 12/21/23); in the initial complaint, Ozy’s legal team said that Smith was interested in BuzzFeed acquiring Ozy as early as 2019. It is also through this case that we have a better understanding of Smith’s financial interest in BuzzFeed during his time as a Times media columnist. According to FAIR’s sources, the prosecution obtained financial records from BuzzFeed in discovery that document how much stake Smith has had in the company over time. FAIR has not seen this sealed document; however, David Robinson, a business scholar at Duke University who served as an expert witness for the defense, did see it. In an April filing in the case, Robinson noted that in Smith’s original report about Ozy, he disclosed that “Under New York Times policy, I can’t write about BuzzFeed extensively until I divest stock options in the company, which I left last year.” But, Robinson noted: Columnist Benjamin Smith had, at the time of that article’s writing, an ownership stake in BuzzFeed in the form of stock options. Those options would become valuable if BuzzFeed went public later in 2021 in an initial public offering (IPO). In an IPO, options holders, such as Smith, are able to convert their options at the then-anticipated IPO price of $10 per share. Analyzing BuzzFeed’s capital table, I calculated the number of Ben Smith’s outstanding split-adjusted shares. I then computed, for each option grant, the stock price minus the option exercise price multiplied by the number of options for each option grant, to arrive at the proceeds that Ben Smith would net upon selling his options. I estimate that Ben Smith’s options had an expected value of approximately $23,468,268.64. On January 4, 2022, the New York Times announced that Smith had left the paper to start a new media company, one [that] “would aim to break news and offer nuance to complex stories, without falling into familiar partisan tropes.” In a phone interview with FAIR, Robinson clarified that, since he issued this testimony, he revised his calculations based on BuzzFeed’s capitalization table. This reduced his estimate of Smith’s stake to $7.4 million, still a princely sum—and a valuation that he said, to his knowledge, hasn’t been challenged. “I think he had a clear sizable material stake in BuzzFeed in the time when other corporations’ decisions were immediately impacting the value of BuzzFeed,” Robinson told FAIR. “I’m simply trying to bring to light the bias that seems to be apparent.” The New York Times‘ rules about financial conflicts cite as an example, “a reporter responsible for any segment of media coverage may not own any media stock”—and make clear that that includes options. That Smith had a conflict of interest does not mean that all or indeed any of the reporting he published about BuzzFeed‘s rivals was untrue or unjustified. (Some of the outlets he criticized, like Substack and German media giant Axel Springer, are ones I’ve also critiqued at FAIR—3/4/21, 11/5/21). The problem with Smith’s conflict of interest is that it gave him a financial incentive to encourage the decline of these particular outlets. Times readers can’t know whether, or how much, this incentive factored into his journalistic decisions—especially as the scale of the conflict was not made clear to those readers. Moreover, the Times has clear rules about stock ownership. Its ethics guidelines say: No staff member may own stock or have any other financial interest in a company, enterprise or industry that figures or is likely to figure in coverage that he or she provides, edits, packages or supervises regularly. In several early columns, Smith included disclaimers about the conflict. In a column (5/3/20) on union organizing in newsrooms that mentioned his experience at BuzzFeed, for instance, Smith included this disclosure: I agreed with the Times when I was hired that I wouldn’t cover BuzzFeed extensively in this column, beyond leaning on what I learned during my time there, because I retain stock options in the company, which could bring me into conflict with the Times’ ethics standards. I also agreed to divest those options as quickly as I could, and certainly by the end of the year. But this deadline was quietly extended—and BuzzFeed went public right before he left the Times (Vox, 12/6/21). It appears that he never wrote directly about BuzzFeed, but Slate‘s Justin Peters (10/15/21) noted that as the end-of-year deadline came and went, Smith’s columns stopped mentioning any sort of deadline by which he would divest. When Peters inquired with the Times, spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha said Smith’s deadline was extended until February 2022—two years after he was hired. BuzzFeed went public in December 2021. Smith left the Times to start Semafor in January 2022. Rhoades Ha told FAIR that Smith’s deadline was extended “due to the pandemic,” and that he “disclosed the options when relevant in that period.” Smith and the media desk at Semafor did not respond to requests for comment. Pointing out that it’s “bad for readers to have a media columnist whose motives they cannot absolutely trust to be disinterested,” Slate‘s Justin Peters (10/15/21) wrote that Smith “probably shouldn’t be writing about such a broad swath of digital media.” Peters (Slate, 10/15/21) reported that neither Smith nor the Times explained why Smith stopped putting a divestment deadline on the investment disclosures in his columns. Further, he said: Neither Smith nor Rhoades Ha responded to separate questions about why, exactly, the Times extended Smith’s divestment deadline, or whether the shifting deadline had anything to do with BuzzFeed’s plans to go public. But an SEC filing from July pertaining to BuzzFeed’s proposed SPAC merger—and an amended filing dated October 1—describes a 180-day post-merger lockup period during which certain stockholders and options holders are prohibited from transferring their shares. The Times is not offering a sufficient answer. For one thing, it ignores the scope of Smith’s reported stake. Had he stood to gain a few thousand dollars from his former media employer while working on the media beat, big deal (sarcasm). But millions? Big deal (not sarcasm). And there seems to be a betrayal of the spirit of the Times’ own codes about conflicts of interest when the deadline was extended for him; if the paper can bend the rules on the media beat, where else could it bend the rules? When FAIR told Robinson that the Times confirmed that the Smith’s deadline to divest had been extended, he countered, “What good is a stop sign if you tell people they’re free to run through it?” “Given that he was a senior executive, it stands to reason he’d have a significant stake in the company,” Robinson said of Smith and BuzzFeed. “I just think it’s not appropriate for him to be writing about the company’s competitors.” FAIR’s work is sustained by our generous contributors, who allow us to remain independent.

Title: The End Of Management? Gen Z Faces New Challenges In 2025

Gen Z faces the disappearance of management jobs in 2025. In 2025, it’s predicted that 1 in 10 management roles will be filled by Gen Z. But that’s a complicated statistic, when management jobs are going the way of the milk man and the fax machine. Forbes highlights the stark reality of white-collar job cuts, with middle-management positions being systematically eliminated at organizations like Google, Meta, UPS and others. Indeed, middle management positions accounted for nearly a third of layoffs in 2023, according to reports from Live Data Technologies. That’s bad news for Gen Z workers seeking guidance, mentoring and oversight. Or a white-collar job in management. Is management a disappearing career? CNBC reports that Amazon is shifting to an individual-contributor model - a type of unbossing that could foster the elimination of as many as 14,000 management roles. Other companies are making similar moves on a smaller scale, cutting into the middle to improve the bottom line. What’s really at work here? Is AI making middle management positions redundant? “Digital transformation plays a significant role,” according to Joseph Roh, a professor at the Neeley School of Business at Texas Christian University who commented on the unbossing trend on CNBC. “Automation and advanced technologies reduce the need for middle managers to oversee tasks that can now be monitored by software.” While management is disappearing, employee engagement is suffering. Gallup notes that the connection between employees and managers is a driving force behind performance and employee wellbeing, stating that “the role of the manager has never been more important”. But is it really? The crisis for Gen Z isn’t that thousands of middle managers have lost their jobs. The key takeaway here is that these jobs don’t really exist anymore. Is it any wonder that employee engagement is in the ditch, and Forbes reports that 52% of Gen Z workers don’t want to be middle managers? Self-leadership is the direction for Gen Z, but navigating without guidance might be the real challenge. In a Harris poll, 82% of managers said that Gen Z new hires need more training in soft skills. Meanwhile, nearly 80% of Gen Z employees say that these highly-desired soft skills can’t be taught, and can only be developed by watching more seasoned employees over time. A Catch-22 is the result of these mutually conflicting conditions. It’s the classic chicken and the egg paradox: how do you gain valuable experience without the opportunity to gain valuable experience? Or be managed by those who can share it? The Harris Poll revealed that over half of Gen Z employees feel underprepared for professional roles, citing a lack of soft-skill training during their formative years (read: COVID). How do you demonstrate what you have not observed, learned or experienced? Over half of Gen Z employees say that a lack of interpersonal training makes them afraid of “asking dumb questions”. According to the survey, nearly 60% of Gen Z employees don’t know who to turn to for help with their soft skills. Perhaps because their manager was recently fired? Linda Jingfang Cai, VP of talent development at LinkedIn, told Fortune that soft skills are “the currency of the future workplace”. She said that any company helmed by people who don’t prioritize empathy and connection will lose out on this vital currency. As AI further integrates itself into business operations, soft skills are becoming more significant in 2025. Think judgment, teamwork, and articulating a vision—even a vision for the next phase of AI. Coaching can augment unknowns, accelerate experience and provide a safe space for “dumb questions”. Here are three actionable ways coaching can help: For Gen Z, the workplace of 2025 is a crucible of opportunity and challenge - with more of the latter inhibiting the former. If engagement and performance are going to be a part of the future of work, individuals and organizations have to access new skills, now. Self-leadership has never been more important than it is now. That trend is only going to continue in the age of AI. Through a commitment to coaching and skill-building, Gen Z and employers can bridge the management gap - and be better prepared for the future of work. One Community. Many Voices.

Yesterday evening, Morgan Stanley became the latest US bank to depart from the Net Zero Banking Alliance, as pressure increasingly mounted on financial institutions from Republican lawmakers. Despite leaving the alliance, Morgan Stanley said in a statement that the bank’s commitment to meeting its carbon targets “remains unchanged”. Citigroup and Bank of America also left the group earlier this week, while Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs departed earlier in December. The UN-backed alliance, which includes over 140 banks with more than $70 trillion (£56.5 trillion) in assets, was founded in 2021 with the goal of bringing the financial sector into alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement. It is an initiative of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, co-chaired by Michael Bloomberg and former Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Other voluntary industry climate alliances, including the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, the now-disbanded Net Zero Insurance Alliance, and the Climate Action 100+ investor initiative have similarly seen exits from major industry players in recent years. A large reason for the departure of many financial institutions from institutions like this has been pressure from right-wing lawmakers in the US to try and push banks away from sustainable investing. The issue has been a thorn in the side of giant US asset managers such as Blackrock, who have faced condemnation and attacks from Republican politicians. Last year, Blackrock was sued by the attorney general of Tennessee over its ESG policies, while it has been dropped from the public pension funds of multiple US states due to its support of sustainable investing. In November, Scottish asset manager Baillie Gifford left both the Climate Action 100+ group and Net Zero Asset Managers initiative after it became embroiled in a months-long scandal over its sponsorship of literary festivals. “Our membership has become contested, and this risks distracting from our core responsibilities,” a Baillie Gifford spokesperson told City AM at the time. Despite fears that the departures may lead to a watering down of climate pledges, analysts explained that as regulatory burdens have grown on financial institutions to hire those with sustainability credentials, the need to be part of these groups has become less necessary.

Title: Risk Appetites Dim in Week of New Year’s Angst on Wall Street

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- The turning of the calendar is an occasion to look ahead. For Wall Street at New Year’s, the verdict on the future is one of trepidation. Most Read from Bloomberg Is This Weird Dome the Future of Watching Sports? NYC Congestion Pricing to Take Effect After Years of Delays NYPD Seeking Gunmen After 10 People Wounded Outside Queens Venue NYC Congestion Pricing Takes Effect After Years of Delays Burned-Out Parents Need Better Public Spaces While spirits perked up on Friday, traders across asset classes spent much of the post-holiday period reining in the robust risk appetites that have ruled markets for much of 2024. Volatility measures crept up in Treasuries and corporate credit. They jumped in stocks, which posted the worst end-of-year slump on record. The largest exchange-traded fund tracking Bitcoin, darling of speculators globally, saw its worst-ever outflows. Nothing in markets implied panic. But the moves did signal a wariness that has been largely absent in the past 12 months, at least in risk assets where a booming economy and easing Federal Reserve policy have been a recipe for nearly straight-up gains. Concern about Donald Trump’s presidential policies and their impact on inflation awoke hedging markets and kept bonds unsettled after the biggest quarterly runup in 10-year Treasury yields in more than two years. To contrarians who have watched months of rampant risk-taking on Wall Street, any newfound caution is seen as healthy — a brake on overheating. Still, the pullback in certain assets, equities in particular, defied a historic pattern where the S&P 500 has tended to rise in the sessions right after Christmas, highlighting the hazards of preset playbooks in the second Trump era. “We were a little surprised to see the market so risk-off at the end of 2024, but it is possible that the market was getting a slight jump on 2025,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management. “It makes sense to us to take some risk off the table given the incoming administration is likely to make policy changes.” Ten-year Treasury yields held above the widely watched 4.5% level as traders braced for tariffs that could come as early as this month after Trump’s inauguration, adding fresh risk to the Fed’s inflation-fighting campaign. Bond vigilantes have also been sounding alarms that Trump’s tax-cut agenda threatens to widen the fiscal deficit. Signs of bullishness resurfaced on Friday, with the S&P 500 rising 1.3% as megacap tech stocks rallied and investors took relief from a swift re-election of the US House speaker. For the week, equities retreated, hovering near a low reached after the Fed’s last policy meeting, when central bankers signaled fewer interest rate reductions for this year than previously forecast. The specter of policy uncertainty has put investors on edge, with demand for protection rising across assets. The Cboe Volatility Index, a gauge of the cost of S&P 500 options, climbed for a third week in four. A similar measure for Treasuries, the ICE BofA Move Index, hit a one-month high while turbulence ticked up in high-yield bonds and currencies. The low-level gloom is a departure from recent months, when raging gambling spirits sent Bitcoin above $100,000 and drove billions of dollars to leveraged ETFs. Now, BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is seeing its longest streak of outflows, including a record withdrawal on Thursday, while short sellers are reloading wagers against some of the largest ETFs tracking corporate debt. In equities, an indicator of exposure kept by the National Association of Active Investment Managers slipped for a third straight week, marking the biggest drop since April. Meanwhile, a Cboe measure of options trading showed that volume in bearish puts spiked to the highest level in almost four months relative to bullish calls. The risk aversion, for now, is at odds with optimism among Wall Street strategists in a Bloomberg survey, whose consensus calls for another 12% gain in 2025 after the S&P 500 scored a two-year, 53% rally. “The dominant market view is that equities will continue climbing a wall of worry, but we know the incoming US administration loves building tall walls. In other words, the obstacles to keep delivering gains will get bigger,” said Max Gokhman, senior vice president at Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions. “So while I’m not going out of consensus to be bearish, it’s prudent to be careful and ready to tactically return to the sidelines.” Higher anxiety levels are visible across markets. Bank of America Corp.’s Global Financial Stress indicator — which measures market risk, hedging demand and investor flows — sat above where it was 12 months ago. Part of the uneasiness reflects lingering concern over market valuations, according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. A Bloomberg model that adjusts the S&P 500 earnings yield and 10-year Treasury rates for inflation shows pricing for the world’s two most-watched assets is historically stretched. In fact, current cross-asset valuations, in real terms, are higher than 88% of the time in data going back to 1962. “A modicum of caution at these tight valuations make sense but the growth story still feels intact,” Rosner said.

Nvidia (NVDA) was one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 in 2024, having nearly tripled in value. It has become one of the best-known AI stocks in recent years, because its high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand for AI applications. According to Jon Peddie Research, the market for add-on GPUs grew 47.9% between the second quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2024 (the latest quarter for which data is available) [0]Jon Peddie Research. Shipments of graphics AIBs see significant surge in Q2 2024. Accessed Dec 13, 2024.View all sources. Nvidia is the biggest player in this market, and its GPUs power some of the most prominent AI products, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But it isn’t a monopoly, and there are a few publicly traded companies that compete with Nvidia. Nvidia controls more than four-fifths of the market for add-on GPUs. But there are two other companies with some market share: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Source: Jon Peddie Research. Before graphics processing units became prized for industrial computing activities such as running AI models and Bitcoin mining, they were mainly used in gaming PCs and video game consoles — to, as their name suggests, process graphics. AMD has been Nvidia’s main rival ever since their gaming days, but both companies now derive most of their revenue from selling chips and services to data centers. AMD isn’t quite as specialized in AI chips as Nvidia is, and it has a fraction of its market share. But in 2023, several of the world’s largest tech companies switched from using Nvidia chips to AMD’s Instinct MI300X chip for new AI projects.

Intel is probably more of a household name than AMD or Nvidia. If you’re reading this article on a Windows computer, there’s a good chance there’s an Intel processor in it. However, Intel is newer to the market for GPUs and other AI chips than Nvidia and AMD. Intel launched both its first GPU and its first specialized AI chip in 2022 — although as shown on the graph above, it hasn’t made much of a dent in the market shares of Nvidia and AMD. Together, Nvidia, AMD and Intel make up just about 100% of the market for AI chips, but these three are not entirely alone in the chipmaking space. Many big tech companies are developing their own AI hardware, too — they just don’t sell very much of it at the moment. These minor chipmakers include: Alphabet (GOOG). Amazon (AMZN). Apple (AAPL). IBM (IBM). Microsoft (MSFT). Qualcomm (QCOM). In some cases, these companies have negligible shares of the overall AI chip market because they’ve primarily developed chips for “in-house” use — to power their own AI products and systems. For example, Microsoft is a major backer of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. Likewise, Amazon is a major shareholder of Anthtropic, a private company that developed Claude, a large language model (LLM) that competes with ChatGPT. Alphabet is the maker of Gemini, another ChatGPT rival. The companies listed in the previous section control tiny shares of the AI chip market — but that doesn’t mean they’re tiny companies. All of them are blue-chip tech stocks, and all except IBM and Qualcomm are worth trillions of dollars. A well-diversified portfolio will likely have exposure to some or all of these stocks, either through index funds or individual shares. When it comes to Nvidia’s biggest competitors, AMD and Intel, it’s hard to say what the future holds. Wall Street analysts generally believe that there’s a place for AMD in the chip market of the future, but they’re more pessimistic about Intel. Of the analysts surveyed by TipRanks who cover AMD, 73% give it a “buy” rating, with the rest rating it a “hold.” That’s not a bad percentage, although it’s lower than Nvidia’s. (For reference, 92.5% of TipRanks-surveyed analysts covering Nvidia rate it a “buy,” with the rest rating it a “hold.”) Nvidia and AMD have been vying for control of the GPU market for decades. Nvidia has the lead right now, but AMD has recently had some successes with its AI chipmaking efforts, such as big orders from Microsoft, Meta (META) and OpenAI. However, analysts are more bearish on Intel, which entered the AI chip market later and has failed to get as much traction as Nvidia or AMD. As shown above, Intel currently accounts for less than 1% of the add-on GPU market. Of the analysts surveyed by TipRanks who cover Intel, 76% rate it a “hold,” and 21% rate it a “sell,” with only 3% rating it a “buy.” » MORE: Best-performing semiconductor stocks Neither the author nor editor held positions in the aforementioned investments at the time of publication.

Title: VanEck CEO recommends investors to double down on Bitcoin as hedge in 2025

As gold and Bitcoin register a bull market, Jan van Eck stated that these assets are essential for any portfolio. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck, has recommended that investors maintain or increase their exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and gold in 2025 in the firm’s 2025 outlook report. He argued that these assets are indispensable hedges against inflationary pressures, fiscal uncertainty, and global de-dollarization trends. According to van Eck, gold and Bitcoin have proven to be resilient stores of value amidst global economic turbulence. He added: “Bull markets in gold and Bitcoin are supported by inflationary pressures, fiscal uncertainty, and de-dollarization trends.” Consequently, he emphasized that these assets are essential for any portfolio seeking to guard against inflation. Robust foreign central bank purchases and a growing shift away from reliance on the US dollar in global trade drive gold’s current bull market. This de-dollarization trend has amplified the demand for gold as a stable and reliable asset. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has recently surged past the $100,000 mark, continuing its bull cycle following the halving event in the second quarter of 2024. Van Eck projects BTC could reach $150,000 to $170,000 during this cycle, driven by its increasing adoption as a “store of value” asset. Additionally, based on historical patterns from prior halving events, Bitcoin is in the midst of a three-year bull market, which positions it as a pivotal asset for long-term wealth preservation. While van Eck acknowledges the potential for volatility, particularly in gold, he remains optimistic about the long-term prospects for both assets. As a result, even amid price corrections, the fundamentals of BTC and gold will remain strong. Notably, van Eck’s vision aligns with other analysts. In October, Geoffrey Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, highlighted that BTC is a hedge for systemic financial risks, although not a solid alternative for geopolitical tensions. In a nine-page letter published in September, BlackRock told its investors that Bitcoin is resilient to “black swan” macro events, such as banking system crises, sovereign debt crises, currency debasement, and geopolitical disruption. The document also highlighted that Bitcoin could be used to hedge against possible US dollar instability stemming from federal debt and deficit fears, which would further improve the attractiveness of alternative assets.

Title: Bitcoin – How USD’s strength, low stablecoin supply could dictate price action

A stronger dollar tends to weaken the demand for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $100,000 in mid-December. Since then, the king coin has struggled to regain its momentum on the charts. At press time, BTC was trading at $96,789 following gains of 1.5% in 24 hours, with the crypto still just over 10% shy of its ATH. While Bitcoin could stage a recovery later this month thanks to Donald Trump’s inauguration as U.S President, two key factors could continue to weigh on the price. The U.S dollar index (DXY), which measures the performance of the U.S dollar against major currencies, has surged to 109 – its highest level since November 2022. What this hike indicates is that the U.S dollar has been gaining strength lately. (Source: MarketWatch) The DXY is inversely correlated with Bitcoin’s price, meaning that a hike limits the coin’s upside potential. Additionally, a stronger dollar tends to weaken the demand for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. In fact, the fall in demand is already evident in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. On the first day of trading in 2025, the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF recorded $332M in outflows, marking its highest outflows in history. The total outflows from all 11 Bitcoin ETFs hit $242M, as per SoSoValue. If these outflows persist, it could fuel a surge in sell-side pressure. This will, in turn, fuel a downtrend for BTC on the charts. The weakened demand seemed not only evident among institutional investors, but also in the retail market. For instance – According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) surged to 17 – Its highest level in seven days. (Source: CryptoQuant) A higher ratio means that the supply of stablecoins is low, compared to BTC’s market cap. This results in low buying pressure that could exert downward pressure on the price. Despite market factors pointing to reducing demand and buying pressure, the Fear and Greed Index, which measures the market sentiment, revealed that traders are still bullish. This index had a value of 74 at press time, suggesting that most traders are optimistic about BTC’s price movement. Since the index climbed from 65 earlier this week, it could be good news for BTC if traders start buying. However, if the buy-side pressure is not enough to absorb the sold coins, it could limit the gains on the charts.

Title: 2024: The Year Crypto Silenced Its Critics? The Numbers Tell All

Time Published: 2025-01-03T19:30:51Z

The chart tracks the frequency of “Bitcoin obituaries” - articles declaring Bitcoin’s demise - from ... [+] 2010 to 2024. The number of such articles peaked dramatically in 2017 with 124 publications, coinciding with Bitcoin’s first major price surge. Since then, obituaries have steadily declined, reaching just 2 articles in 2024 despite Bitcoin crossing $100,000. This reduction in negative predictions, from the 2017 peak to present day, suggests a notable shift in how the cryptocurrency is perceived by commentators and institutions. After Donald Trump’s election in 2024, an unexpected moment of candor emerged from an unlikely source. On their long-running Crypto Critics' Corner podcast, Cas Piancey and Bennett Tomlin—two of cryptocurrency's most well informed skeptics—made a striking admission. After years of investigating and criticizing Tether and the broader crypto ecosystem, they conceded that their long-predicted regulatory crackdown was unlikely to materialize. In their words “They win, we lose”. This moment of capitulation from prominent critics wasn't an isolated incident. At 99Bitcoins, a website that has diligently tracked Bitcoin's "death" pronouncements since 2010, the editors found themselves with surprisingly little to do in 2024. Their "Bitcoin obituaries" counter, which records major declarations of Bitcoin's demise by media and notable figures, recorded just two such pronouncements all year: the lowest number since 2012. The pattern is striking. Bitcoin obituaries peaked in 2017 with 124 declarations of its death, coinciding with its first major price surge. Another surge appeared in 2021-2022 during Bitcoin's second major bull run and the subsequent FTX collapse. But 2024's mere two obituaries mark a shift in perception. The Bitcoin ETF approval has a lot to do with this. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs in March 2024 didn't just mark a regulatory milestone, it unleashed an unprecedented wave of institutional adoption. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, in particular, shattered every previous ETF launch record. Reaching $10 billion in assets under management in just seven weeks, it accomplished what took the previous record-holder, SPDR Gold Shares, two years to achieve. By the end of 2024, the iShares Bitcoin Trust had accumulated over $50 billion in assets under management—a stunning achievement in just 11 months. The first day of trading alone saw volumes exceeding $4.65 billion, signalling massive pent-up demand from both institutional and retail investors. With total net assets over $106 billion, these Bitcoin ETFs aren't just successful: they're approaching the scale of gold ETFs that have been established for decades. This isn't merely adoption; it's a wholesale transformation of how traditional finance views and accesses cryptocurrency. Larry Fink's evolution from crypto skeptic to champion perfectly embodies this transformation. The BlackRock CEO's journey from dismissing Bitcoin as a money laundering tool to overseeing one of the most successful ETF launches in financial history represents the broader institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. The transformation in the political sphere has been equally dramatic. Donald Trump, once a cryptocurrency skeptic who described Bitcoin as "a scam against the dollar" in 2021, has emerged as a powerful voice in the crypto space. His appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference marked a key moment in cryptocurrency's global political legitimacy. The selection of JD Vance, a well-known crypto advocate, as his vice presidential candidate further signalled cryptocurrency's emergence as a serious policy consideration. Perhaps most significantly, the conversation in Washington has evolved from regulatory skepticism to strategic opportunity. The discussion of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in the U.S. Senate - unthinkable just a few years ago - represents a fundamental shift in how government officials view cryptocurrency's role in the national economy. This isn't just about accepting crypto's existence; it's about potentially integrating it into national financial strategy. This acceptance isn't limited to Bitcoin. Stablecoins, backed by major financial institutions and payment processors like Stripe, are processing transaction volumes comparable to traditional payment networks like Visa. This represents a fundamental innovation in payment technology that's becoming impossible to ignore. The steep decline in Bitcoin obituaries in 2024 isn't just a statistical curiosity. It's a marker of cryptocurrency's transition from a speculative phenomenon to an established part of the financial landscape. The question is no longer whether crypto will survive, but how it will evolve and integrate with traditional financial systems. The editors at 99Bitcoins might find themselves even less busy in the years to come, but they've documented something remarkable: the year when cryptocurrency's critics had to accept that crypto is here to stay.

Title: Top Expert Sees 'Healthy Pause' for Bitcoin ETF Growth

U.Today - The start of 2025 brought an unexpected twist for BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as investors pulled out a whopping $332.6 million in just one day, which is equal to 3,413 BTC. This is the biggest withdrawal from the ETF since it launched, bigger than the $188.7 million anti record, which happened in the last decade of December. A top ETF analyst Eric Balchunas from Bloomberg reacted to the historical anti record with a more "glass half full" approach, claiming that these pullbacks are to be expected and are long overdue. He also said that Bitcoin ETFs probably won't keep growing so fast, and while the amount of money that left might have caught some by surprise, it's just a sign that things are shifting. It's like taking a breather on a journey where you have been moving forward consistently, from an expert's point of view. The timing of these outflows lines up with a developing story in Bitcoin's price dynamics. There is a pattern on the charts that looks like a "head-and-shoulders" shape, and if it breaks below the $92,000 neckline, it could take the price to as low as $70,000 per BTC. The details still tell a different story as IBIT ended 2024 on a strong note, pulling in over $37 billion in inflows over the year. Its Ethereum equivalent, ETHA, also got a lot of attention, raking in $3.53 billion. These ETFs helped solidify BlackRock's spot as a major player in institutional crypto investment, with Bitcoin holdings worth about $53 billion and Ethereum at almost $3.7 billion. But even the best of these funds can be affected by market cycles. This article was originally published on U.Today

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. As promised, I’ve got a special mailbag issue this week. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions. Like last year, I picked a handful that hit some of the themes I plan to continue covering in 2025. On to your questions… I’m really concerned / worried / curious about the near-term future. Between now and 10 years from now, I think it is very clear AI will be replacing many job functions. What are we all going to do? The leaders at the AI labs say that, yes, there will be job loss, but that doesn’t mean catastrophe. The optimistic take is that humans are creative and will invent new jobs, like they always have when technology changes things. At the moment, there’s also a macro belief among the CEOs driving a lot of the spending on infrastructure for AI that its impact will be deflationary and lead to GDP growth. Job displacement will still be painful, of course. Sam Altman and others believe that some form of universal basic income will be necessary to offset the economic impacts of AGI. Altman has his other startup, Tools for Humanity, already scanning eyeballs and distributing cryptocurrency. But I think it’s way too early to be seriously concerned. As Altman himself recently said, AGI is going to be declared soon and we probably won’t notice. How much better is the reasoning on AI models, and is it actually something I should care about? I know people who have tried ChatGPT’s o1 pro mode and notice a difference. But I haven’t seen anything mind-blowing from o1 or what Noam Shazeer at Google just put out, though perhaps I am a bit jaded by the last two years of AI hype. My advice would be to play with what you can access / afford and see for yourself. The expense of running these cutting-edge “reasoning” models is currently keeping them at bay for a lot of people. I expect access to widen significantly in 2025. Knowing how to prompt these different kinds of models effectively remains a struggle, and I’d like to see more interface improvements in apps like ChatGPT to help teach people why they should use a reasoning model. An even better move would be to abstract away all these definitions and focus on what tools can do for people. What kind of outlook do you see for Snap in 2025 and beyond? Snap’s biggest problem going into 2025 is the same problem it had going into 2024: its business isn’t growing fast enough. The app itself is bigger than ever and growing quickly, but yearly revenue growth last quarter was less than Meta’s. That’s not a compelling pitch to Wall Street when you are already viewed as the underdog. Even with ads being placed in the Chat tab and the new Spotlight redesign slowly rolling out, the jury is out on if the business can rebound to the pace it needs to this year. A depressed stock price makes it harder to recruit and retain talent, which has become more of a problem for Snap in the last couple of years. I do think the vibe could shift quickly if TikTok does end up being banned in the US or severely hamstrung by a new ownership structure. I continue to be skeptical of Evan Spiegel’s commitment to hardware with Spectacles. As I’ve written before, his foresight and ambition to build AR glasses is admirable. But Snap looks increasingly outgunned in hardware. What do you expect from Meta’s glasses in 2025? There have been a couple of reports recently saying that Meta is planning to ship a pair of smart glasses with a heads-up display this year. I first reported this was going to happen in February 2023. Hypernova, as the product is internally referred to at Meta, will have a viewfinder for interacting with things like Meta AI and notifications. In my write-up of the Orion prototype, I spent a lot of time on the neural wristband because it’s going to ship with Hypernova as a way to control them (while Orion’s commercial successor is still a couple years out at least). I expect this band to be the part of the glasses that surprises people the most. Using it for the first time feels like magic. As I reported in 2023, Meta is also planning a separate smartwatch as an optional upgrade with the neural capability and more features for health tracking, etc. It’s going to be a very interesting year for Meta on the hardware front. Is TikTok going to actually be banned? No one I’ve spoken with who is in a position to know thinks that China will let TikTok be fully divested from ByteDance. The algorithm definitely won’t be sold, but as I’ve explained before, that isn’t as important a factor as it was the last time TikTok was facing a ban. At the same time, there is too much money and power at stake for TikTok to just disappear. President-elect Donald Trump wants to make a deal. The most likely outcome is a different version of the frankensteinian “TikTok Global” joint venture proposal that ByteDance agreed to back in 2020. I could see Oracle staying involved this second time given Larry Ellison’s ongoing influence at Mar-a-Lago. ByteDance will most likely continue running TikTok day-to-day while divesting some of its ownership stake. The real wild card in all this, however, is Elon Musk, who has had serious TikTok envy since he bought X… Are you more bullish or bearish on Google than you were a year ago? Honestly, bullish. It’s going to be difficult to achieve Sundar Pichai’s 2025 mandate of making Gemini a serious rival to ChatGPT on the consumer side, but Google has a fountain of money, the technical talent, and unrivaled distribution. The company’s challenge is more of a cultural one. The more you have, the more you have to protect. It’s hard to get such a large, sprawling conglomerate to move fast and not care about the risk of backlash. Pichai seems well aware of this and the threats he faces, though. Even if Google has to end its Search default payments to Apple (which I predict will be the most likely outcome of the DOJ antitrust case), doing so probably hurt Apple’s bottom line more than Google’s, as Eddy Cue himself argued last week. Then there’s Waymo, which may end up paying for all of Google’s “other bets” failures over the years — and then some. What is a good book you recommend that falls in line with the things you report on? A curse of already reading so much for my job is that I rarely want to spend time on a book. The last book I read in full was The Biggest Bluff by Maria Konnikova, which has nothing to do with tech but is super valuable if you are getting into poker. I enjoyed how her story of becoming a pro player is woven into explaining the technicalities of the game. Three work-related books I have in my Amazon wish list I’m hoping to get to this year: Chip War, The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium, and The Wolves of K Street. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Title: Rivian stock surges to start the year on better-than-expected EV deliveries

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped more than 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31. Rivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks — within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period and 51,000 for the year. Rivian stock had a rough 2024. Shares ended the year down 40% from 2023 and nearly 90% from their all-time high above $100 in the company's high-profile market debut in 2021. After its blockbuster IPO three years ago, the Amazon-backed EV maker has faced a mountain of obstacles: First, it grappled with a shortage of necessary computer chips; then, there was a wider market shift away from electric cars just as competition from mainstay Tesla (TSLA) was heating up. The company has undergone a massive cost-cutting campaign, slashing its workforce in multiple rounds of layoffs starting as early as 2022 and redesigning car components to make production less expensive. Even with those efforts, Rivian’s operating losses mounted in the past year. In its third quarter last year, Rivian’s revenue fell for the first time since it went public, dropping 35% to $874 million versus the $980 million expected by analysts as the company faced yet another production disruption thanks to a miscommunication with a key supplier. Rivian’s fourth quarter deliveries number released Friday “affirms that supply issues were isolated to Q3,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan wrote in a note to shareholders Friday. Narayan holds a Neutral rating on the stock and sees shares hovering around $12 over the next 12 months. The stock was trading above $16 Friday. Meanwhile, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson maintained his Sell rating on Rivian shares, with a price target of just $8, noting Rivian’s “bottom-line losses are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.” Rivian will report its full fourth quarter results on Feb. 20.

Title: Edith Yeung Sees Big Things to Come for Crypto in Hong Kong

As the co-founder and general partner at early stage venture capital fund Race Capital, Edith Yeung has had a front-row seat on the development of the crypto sector, particularly in Hong Kong, where she was born and raised. Most notably, she was a seed investor in Solana, investing $250,000 when SOL was valued at just $0.04, and also was an early investor in Lightning Network. Since 2017, Yeung has also authored the China Internet report, an influential annual survey of technology trends in China. Here, Yeung, who will be a speaker at Consensus Hong Kong, discusses Hong Kong’s ongoing development as a crypto hub, her take on China’s stance towards crypto, what she foresees for Solana and one big crypto prediction for 2025. This series is brought to you by Consensus Hong Kong. Come and experience the most influential event in Web3 and Digital Assets, Feb.18-20. Register today and save 15% with the code CoinDesk15. Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. How do you see crypto regulations developing in HK in 2025? Do you think more crypto companies will become licensed by the SFC in 2025? It’s exciting to see that Hong Kong now has seven SFC-licensed virtual asset trading platforms. From an investor’s perspective, having a clear licensing regime is a major step forward. Regulatory clarity and predictability are like well-lit roads — they give investors the confidence to drive forward without worrying about unexpected detours. That said, licensing alone isn’t enough. Liquidity is the other critical piece of the puzzle. Think of a trading platform like a brand-new highway: you can have the smoothest pavement and clearest signs, but if no cars are on it, drivers won’t bother. Similarly, no matter how many licenses you have, if there’s no active trading and liquidity, investors will hesitate to come aboard. The key for Hong Kong now is to build not just the infrastructure but the traffic flow — because a great platform without liquidity is like an empty highway going nowhere. What kind of role do you see Hong Kong developing in terms of the crypto sector, especially in relation to the US? What about Asia more broadly? Hong Kong is the New York of Asia. Exchange Square is basically Wall Street — a 24/7 financial powerhouse with soaring skyscrapers and streets full of traders, investors and bankers with energy that never quits. If you are a crypto builder or investor, you will find many TradFi talents (traders, market makers, etc.) in Hong Kong. To build a successful TradFi or DeFi company, you need to recruit specific types of talent that are hard to find even in Silicon Valley. Hong Kong boasts a rich financial history, with its stock market origins dating back to 1866 — over 150 years — means there is a deep pool of experienced professionals who can drive innovation and growth in your venture. What would you say is distinctive about HK/Southeast Asia for crypto compared to the US and Europe? The U.S. is home to the largest crypto addressable market in terms of institutional investors, regulators and builders. But Asia is home to the highest growth potential for the crypto market. In 2024, half of the top 10 countries in the world ranked by crypto adoption were located in Asia. With the new Trump administration, the U.S. will continue to set the tone for crypto regulation and institutional adoption (e.g., BlackRock ETF). Asia will follow their lead with its massive usage base that is young and crypto-native. Do you view China as generally pro or anti-crypto? There’s been a lot of crypto activity there, but at the same time, the government is officially against mining and speculation. Hong Kong is part of China. Seeing pro-crypto regulation slowly forming in Hong Kong is a great sign and indicator for China. That said, China literally has an army of 220 million retail investors sitting on almost $21 trillion worth of savings. With a lingering property crisis and a meek economy, however, it is very difficult to say when China will open up for crypto business again, as the government focuses on these larger issues. You were a seed investor in Solana; do you still have your initial investment there? Do you think Solana will continue to attract as much memecoin activity as it did in 2024? Yes. It was an honor that I got to meet Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal and become their seed investor back in March 2018. I am a long-term Solana holder and supporter. What I love about them is their dedication to building and their support for the developer community. The developer energy at the 2024 Breakpoint conference was high not only because of memecoins. The Firedancer team made huge technical advances last year, and I just love that Anatoly is still head-down geeking out with people like Jump Trading chief science officer Kevin Bowers and his team every day. Even more exciting to me is seeing traditional finance players like Fidelity, Citi and PayPal speaking at Breakpoint about what they are building on Solana. This influx of established players not only validates Solana's future but also signals that blockchain technology is ready for the masses. What kinds of companies are you currently looking to invest in and why? I am a seed investor in Huma Finance — a leader in PayFi building on Solana and a leader in stablecoin infrastructure. In 2024, they did over $2 billion in stablecoin transactions. At Race Capital, we will continue to focus on investing in internet infrastructure. Builders who want to be around long-term do not mind whether it’s an up or down cycle. What’s something you think will happen in 2025 that will surprise crypto folks? The establishment of a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve by the end of 2025. The United States is currently the largest holder of Bitcoin, with approximately 207,189 bitcoins. This effort will be bolstered by this massive stockpile, which is now valued at over $20 billion at current prices. This decision is expected to drive up bitcoin prices, prompting other governments around the world to follow suit. What are you most excited to discuss onstage in Hong Kong? Hong Kong’s role in building the crypto industry in 2025, China's love/hate relationship with crypto and perhaps more insights on Solana.

Title: ByteDance and Trump’s Perplexing TikTok Pirouette
URL: http://washingtonmonthly.com/2025/01/03/bytedance-and-trumps-perplexing-tiktok-pirouette/
Time Published: 2025-01-03T17:00:00Z

A looming existential crisis confronts TikTok. Come January 19th, a divestiture deadline will kick in unless the Supreme Court intervenes. (Either ByteDance, TikTok’s Beijing-based parent, sells the social media platform with over 1 billion monthly users, or it will be prohibited from operating in the United States.) Nine days earlier, on January 10th, the high court will hear two hours of argument on the platform’s fate. If TikTok loses, app stores like Apple, Google, and others will be barred from offering TikTok to new users—for all intents and purposes, a technological death sentence. This dictum, enacted into law in April, stems from an informed fear that the Chinese Communist Party would use TikTok to access personal data and surveil Americans. “Communications applications that are owned and operated by companies controlled by foreign adversary countries present a clear threat to the national security of the United States,” in the words of a House committee. The TikTok saga showcases tensions within the GOP. First broached by President Donald Trump in a 2020 executive order, the doomsday scenario reappeared last spring. On the other hand, Trump is now boosting TikTok, opposing the ban he once championed. He even credits the app for playing a role in his political resurrection. “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok because I won youth by 34 points,” he said at a December 16th press conference. “And there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that.” To top it off, he hosted Shou Chew, CEO of TikTok, at Mar-a-Lago that same day. For the record, Trump failed to win the under-30 vote in November, but he did make a strong showing. Regardless, his 2020 executive order painted a bullseye on the app. “The spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People’s Republic of China (China) continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,” he declared back then. “Action must be taken to address the threat posed by one mobile application in meticulous, TikTok.” During the 2024 Republican presidential primaries, Nikki Haley—former South Carolina governor and Trump’s first-term U.N. ambassador—saw even more menace in TikTok. Against the backdrop of Hamas’ attack on Israel and campus unrest, she argued that the ubiquitous app purveyed antisemitism. The strictures aimed at TikTok eventually re-emerged as part of a broader aid package to Israel and Ukraine. The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, as it came to be known, also branded China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea as “foreign adversaries”—in case anyone needed reminding. A ton of money is at stake. Goldman Sachs estimates that the app-driven, “creator economy could approach half-a-trillion dollars by 2027.” TikTok is a large but not exclusive part of that. With an American base of 170 million users and creators, it does not intend to lose them. Enter Jeff Yass, co-founder of Susquehanna International Group, a trading company. Its 15 percent stake in ByteDance is valued at about $26 billion. As fate would have it, Susquehanna was also the largest institutional investor in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, which merged with Trump Media & Technology Group, aka Truth Social, in late March. (For the record, Susquehanna and other U.S. investment firms, including BlackRock, General Atlantic, and others own 60 percent of ByteDance). Does this explain Trump’s pirouette on ByteDance? The plot thickens. In March, Trump met with Yass and jettisoned his prior hostility to Chinese ownership of the platform. “If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business,” Trump posted to Truth Social. The competitor of my adversary is my friend, so to speak. “I don’t want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better,” he added. “They are a true Enemy of the People!” On X, Elon Musk trumpeted the sentiment: “Trump’s statement there is correct.” With a significant presence in China, Musk may be loath to offend Xi and the country’s other leaders, regardless of whether TikTok is a competitor to his X platform. By late spring, TikTok and ByteDance commenced a legal challenge to the ban, arguing that the legislative attack failed constitutional muster. Amicus briefs transcended the usual liberal-conservative and left-right divides. To illustrate, Zephyr Teachout, a Bernie Sanders backer and former challenger to Andrew Cuomo for the Democratic nomination for governor of New York, who has written for this magazine, joined a friends-of-court brief backing the government filed by Mark Meador, a former aide to Senator Mike Lee, the Utah Republican, and a one-time fellow at the Heritage Foundation. Matt Stoller, a former staffer to Sanders on the Senate budget committee and an antitrust advocate, was also aboard. Likewise, a bipartisan coalition of members of Congress backed the law. Marco Rubio, Trump’s pick for Secretary of State; Elise Stefanik, Trump’s choice for U.N. ambassador; and Steve Scalise, the House majority leader, supported it, along with former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Representative Ritchie Torres, and Elissa Slotkin, the Democratic senator-elect from Michigan. On the other half of the divide, the libertarian Cato Institute (a beneficiary of Yass’ largesse), the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, the Asian American Federation, the Hispanic Heritage Foundation, and the Muslim Public Affairs Council all backed TikTok. Intellectual and demographic diversity filled the air. Earlier in December, a three-judge appellate panel ruled against Yass & Co. “The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States. Here, the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary’s ability to gather data on people in the United States,” Judge Douglas Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee, wrote. “As the government details and petitioners do not dispute, the PRC engages in an aggressive, global campaign of influence operations against U.S. interests, relying heavily on the internet and social-media platforms.” Significantly, the court also noted that the judiciary traditionally defers to the executive branch’s and Congress’s judgment on national security matters. In those circumstances, the “government’s ‘evaluation of the facts’ is ‘entitled to deference,’” Ginsburg opined. By extension, it is unlikely that the Supreme Court will declare the TikTok ban unconstitutional—a reminder, in 2018, the Roberts court deferred to executive prerogative and upheld the so-called Muslim travel ban. With national security front and center, reversal here appears unlikely. Regardless of the outcome, tensions between the U.S. and China remain on the front burner. To avoid a government shutdown, Congress removed a provision from the recent continuing resolution that would have curbed American investment in China. In the eyes of House Democrats, Musk’s nexus to Beijing played a major role in scuttling the initial budget deal. Fun fact: Musk’s Tesla is the sole foreign auto manufacturer permitted to operate in China without a local partner. “His bottom line depends on staying in China’s good graces,” Representative Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, wrote of the world’s richest man. “He wants to build an AI data center there, too—which could endanger U.S. security. He’s been bending over backward to ingratiate himself with Chinese leaders.” Representative Rosa DeLauro, a senior Connecticut Democrat, took things further in a letter, writing: “It is particularly disturbing that Musk may have sought to upend this critical negotiated agreement to remove a bipartisan provision regulating U.S. investments in China in order to protect his wallet and the Chinese Communist Party at the expense of American workers, innovators, and businesses.” In turn, Musk called for the soon-to-be 18-term member’s expulsion from the House, labeling DeLauro an “awful creature.” As for Trump, his relationship with speech rights remains strained. In case anyone forgot, in January 2018, Trump threw a brushback pitch at author Michael Wolff over Fire and Fury, the first of multiple tell-alls emanating from his White House. Without citing any particular false content or national security concerns, Trump threatened legal action after The Guardian published pre-release excerpts from the book. No one confused Fire and Fury with the Pentagon Papers, and no one should assume Trump’s latest position on TikTok will be his last. Trump is undoubtedly mindful that popular support for restricting TikTok is minimal. Less than one-third of Americans support the ban, down from half in March 2023—the shift cuts across party lines. Republican backing for restrictions on TikTok waned from 60 percent to 42 percent. Democrats saw a similar double-digit slide, from 43 percent to 24 percent. No wonder he asked the Supreme Court to delay argument in the TikTok case until after he assumed the presidency. Ironically, a loss for Yass, TikTok, and Trump at the Court would still present the president-elect with a silver lining—more power. If the Court upholds the ban, it will feed Trump’s expansive views of executive power and his authority, even if the issue here is a legislative ban, because it’ll widen the court’s leeway for national security considerations when it comes to speech. In case anyone forgot, he has already mused about being a dictator for at least a day. Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York and served in the Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Firms Kick Off 2025 Trading in The Red. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bilibili Inc. (NASDAQ:BILI) stands against the other stocks. The stock market finished the first trading day of the year in the negative territory—a fifth straight day, over the lack of catalysts to spark trading appetite. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down the most by 0.36 percent, the S&P 500 decreased 0.22 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.16 percent. Ten companies also kicked off trading mirroring the broader market downturn. In this article, let's explore the reasons behind their decline. To come up with Thursday’s top losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A group of millennials playing an online game on their mobile devices. Video streaming platform Bilibili Inc. (NASDAQ:BILI) saw its share price on Thursday decline by 5.41 percent or 0.98 points to end at $17.13 following disappointing earnings results. According to the company, it generated $1.019 billion in revenues but reported a net loss of $11.09 million, resulting in an earnings per share of -$0.03 and a gross profit of $355 million. The company earlier expected to post a final loss in 2024 before swinging to profitability in 2025. According to analysts, they expect the company to grow 82 percent year-on-year, on average. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected. Overall BILI ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks that crashed yesterday. While we acknowledge the potential of BILI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BILI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Asset allocation dividing an investment portfolio among different asset categories. For a long time now, it seems like the stock market has had a “theme of the year.” Clearly in 2024 it was AI, while 2023 was the year of recovery from 2022, which was a year of panic over a recession that never came. This is odd, as past trends have lasted several years. From 2012 to 2014, for example, it was momentum driven by the Fed’s quantitative easing after the financial crisis. And the dot-com-bubble years spanned more or less from 1994 to 2000. So will 2025 be another “theme year,” or will we see markets shift back to embracing longer-term trends? (Hint: I’m expecting the former, and we’re going to front-run the main theme I see for 2025 to grab ourselves some nice 10%+ dividends paid monthly.) A quick glance at 2024 offers some clues as to where things are headed. Bull Market Above we see the performance of the benchmark index funds for the S&P 500 (in purple) and NASDAQ 100 (in orange), as of this writing. As you can see, the NASDAQ and S&P 500 rose almost the same amount. That’s surprising; we’d expect the NASDAQ’s tilt toward AI names like Amazon.com (AMZN), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) to propel it ahead of the S&P 500. But things are, of course, more complicated than that. For one, consider that 61% of large American companies are planning to use AI to automate tasks. In other words, it’s not just tech benefiting from AI, but firms from across the entire economy. This is good for the whole market, so it’s not surprising that the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 would more or less keep pace with one another. The S&P 500 now has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio around 28, a level it’s only reached a few times in the last 40 years: late 2019, mid 2008, early 2001 and late 1997. Each of these peaks, unfortunately, came right before a bear market. However, there is good news here. First, in 2001, 2008 and 2019, these peaks were hit after a bear market had already begun. In other words, the market hit this high valuation because earnings fell, decreasing the “E” in the P/E ratio and driving up the number overall. So today isn’t really comparable to those eras. The bad news, though, is that 1997 was like today. At the height of the dot-com bubble, stocks priced in future gains that didn’t appear. If AI flops, we could see a similar correction to the one that occurred in the late 1990s. The problem is that there’s no way to know if that pullback will happen in 2025 or, say, 2030 (or at all). So selling now could result in lost money in the long term. With all this in mind, my prediction is this: 2025 will be the year more investors look beyond stocks, particularly for ways to profit from the still-strong market while hedging their downside. That path leads straight to corporate bonds, which yield 7.3% as I write this, for companies with credit ratings of BB+ or below. And our favorite income plays, closed-end funds (CEFs), let us tap corporate bonds for even higher dividends to the tune of 10%+. Our play, then, is to front-run the crowd into these funds, which include the PGIM Global High Yield Fund (GHY), a CEF yielding 10.1% that pays dividends monthly. When it comes to high-yield bonds, many people irrationally worry about defaults. But here’s the truth: Even in the worst crisis, default rates would only spike to around 10%, so if you buy a CEF like GHY, which has bonds from 405 different issuers, you’d sharply limit your risk of loss. Bear in mind, too, that the fund is run by five portfolio managers from Prudential (PRU), a company with a deep bench of talent and resources, providing even more reassurance here. Moreover, the default rates on high-yield bonds are currently around 1%—imperceptible in most CEFs, including GHY. This little-known fund is also well diversified across sectors: GHY Holdings GHY is also well diversified around the world, with a strong base (47.5% of assets) in the US. That’s a nice setup for 2025, when interest rates are expected to decline in the US, sending capital looking for higher returns elsewhere. Also, the fund yields 10.1%, and that yield is pretty reliable, as GHY hasn’t reduced distributions in five years, and in 2024 it out-earned its payouts, suggesting dividends remain covered. Then there’s the fund’s discount to net asset value (NAV). This is the main CEF valuation metric, and right now GHY is discounted, trading at 4.7% below its portfolio value. That discount faded steadily through 2024 before plateauing at its current level in November. If 2025 boosts demand from investors looking for high-yield alternatives to stocks, as I expect it to, GHY’s discount could shrink further. But even if demand holds steady, GHY still has reason to climb, thanks to its strong long-term performance history. As you can see below, GHY (in purple) has more than doubled the corporate-bond benchmark index fund (in orange) over the last decade: GHY Outperforms Double-digit yields and this wind at the fund’s back are strong selling points, with the high price of stocks sealing the deal. Add in the diversification away from stocks that GHY provides, and the fund is an attractive option now. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Firms Kick Off 2025 Trading in The Red. In this article, we are going to take a look at where General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) stands against the other stocks. The stock market finished the first trading day of the year in the negative territory—a fifth straight day, over the lack of catalysts to spark trading appetite. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down the most by 0.36 percent, the S&P 500 decreased 0.22 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.16 percent. Ten companies also kicked off trading mirroring the broader market downturn. In this article, let's explore the reasons behind their decline. To come up with Thursday’s top losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A group of technicians in a garage, inspecting car parts and ensuring safety compliance. Shares of General Motors Co. fell for a third day on Thursday, losing 3.57 percent or 1.90 points to finish at $51.37 apiece as investors sold off positions over concerns about automakers’ vehicle sales. The decline came after Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) fell for the first time in history, having only delivered 1.79 million vehicles during the year as compared with 1.81 million in 2023. In addition, concerns were hounding US and European automakers following statements that Chinese EV makers are already taking the front seat in the industry. Meanwhile, China’s BYD posted its best-ever sales in the fourth quarter of 2024. According to the company, it sold 1.76 million electric cars in 2024. The total was only part of the 4.25 million car sales, which included its hybrid vehicles. Overall GM ranks 7th on our list of the stocks that crashed yesterday. While we acknowledge the potential of GM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Nvidia stock jumps, leads 'Magnificent 7' gains to start 2025 after end-of-year tech sell-off

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024. Shares of the AI chipmaker rose 4.5% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board in the absence of a “Santa Claus" rally, where the stock market typically enjoys a surge between Dec. 24 and Jan. 2. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%, and Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares still ended 2024 up more than 150%. Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data. Bank of America’s Vivek Arya told Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast Thursday that broader market forces and company-specific issues drove the sell-off in Nvidia stock late last year. "What we have seen in the market is a rotation of money from semiconductors to software," Arya said, noting that the latter was less exposed to US trade restrictions on goods to and from China. He added that for Nvidia, "the last two quarters have not been clean, really, because they're going through growing pains from one generation of product that was Hopper to the new generation of product." Arya was referring to concerns surrounding delays in shipments of the company's new Blackwell artificial intelligence chips. "In our view, these are short-term issues," he said. That could create a buying opportunity: While its Magnificent Seven peers are trading at two times their average earnings growth estimates for 2025, Arya noted that Nvidia shares are trading at less than one times the consensus earnings growth for the company this upcoming year. Arya has a Buy rating on Nvidia stock and sees shares rising to $190 over the next 12 months. Shares of Nvidia and its Magnificent Seven peers have benefited from investors' massive bets on artificial intelligence, as well as earnings growth. As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported, through roughly three-quarters of reports, the combination of Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia grew earnings year over year by 33% in 2024, compared to just 4.2% growth for the other 493 S&P 500 companies, per FactSet data. To be sure, skeptics warn of a bubble that could burst and send AI-fueled stocks tumbling if hype over the new technology fades and Big Tech's spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure wanes. Wall Street analysts overall remain convinced the AI enthusiasm will continue, however. Tesla also notched a notable gain Friday, jumping more than 8%. Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta rose around 1%, while Amazon spiked nearly 2%. Apple shares were roughly flat. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

Farside Investors data shows that on Jan. 2 IBIT saw $333 million worth of outflows—the highest ever reported for the Bitcoin ETF. Founder of Obchakevich Research Alex Obchakevich told Decrypt that “the main reason for the outflow is profit-taking by investors in early 2025.” “At the end of the year, investors and funds often review their investment portfolios, which can lead to the sale of some shares,” he explained. U.S.-based BTC spot ETFs overall lost $248 million on Jan. 2. IBIT was the top loser, followed by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) with its $23 million in withdrawals—the only other product to report a negative capital net flow. Isaac Joshua—the CEO of token launch platform Gems—also told Decrypt yesterday that the recent downturn “can largely be attributed to end-of-year tax-loss harvesting by investors,” he explained. According to him, “many have liquidated both Bitcoin ETFs and the underlying asset itself to optimize their tax reports, a common phenomenon in financial markets during this period.” Still, investors remain optimistic about BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. Ryan Lee—chief analyst at the research subsidiary of crypto exchange Bitget—recently highlighted in a note that “BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF is poised to accelerate Bitcoin’s adoption by simplifying access for institutional investors, enhancing its legitimacy and facilitating mainstream acceptance.” IBIT surpassed $50 billion in assets under management just 228 days after its launch—more than five times faster than any other ETF in history. “By bridging traditional finance with cryptocurrency, the ETF is expected to stabilize BTC's market perception and potentially reduce price volatility,” Joshua said. As of press time, CoinMarketCap data indicates that Bitcoin is trading at just under $96,700 after gaining 0.11% over the last 24 hours and 0.35% over the last seven days. The current price is nearly 10.7% lower than the all-time high of nearly $108,300 reported on Dec. 17. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Investors placed bets on shares of Nu Skin Enterprises Inc. (NYSE:NUS) at pre-market trading to buoy its prices by nearly 17 percent following news that it raised $250 million from the sale of its affiliate marketing technology platform. Stock market data on a laptop screen. Photo by Alesia Kozik On Friday, Nu Skin (NUS), through its subsidiary Rhyz Inc. said it completed the sale of the Mavely affiliate marketing platform to Later, a company backed by Summit Partners for $250 million. The deal included both cash and a minor equity stake in the company. Proceeds from the transaction are expected to be used to pay down debt and fund additional innovation. According to data from InvestingPro, the transaction value represents 75 percent of Nu Skin’s (NUS) current market capitalization of $326.1 million, with analysis indicating that the stock is currently undervalued. Mavely is set to merge with Later following the transaction. Approximately $33 million will be paid to other equity holders in the Mavely business. The transaction is expected to provide Nu Skin (NUS) with enhanced capabilities as it continues to develop a beauty, wellness, and lifestyle ecosystem. “Together, we believe Later and Mavely will provide enhanced capabilities to our company as we pursue our broader beauty, wellness, and lifestyle ecosystem vision, while the transaction generates additional capital and resources for us to increase innovation in our core Nu Skin business and investment in our Rhyz companies,” Nu Skin (NUS) President and Chief Executive Officer Ryan Napierski said. “This underscores the value of Rhyz to incubate and scale meaningful businesses with synergistic value across the enterprise,” he added. The transaction was said to have generated an approximate five times return on Nu Skin’s (NUS) cumulative investment in Mavely since acquiring the latter in 2021. The company also plans to use its strengthened balance sheet to buy back stock under its existing stock repurchase program, providing value to its shareholders. Nu Skin (NUS) is an integrated beauty and wellness company that operates in nearly 50 markets worldwide. It boasts of brands including Nu Skin personal care, Pharmanex nutrition, and ageLOC anti-aging. While we acknowledge the potential of NUS our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

US stocks stepped higher on Friday, shaking off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Friday was the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But hopes dimmed after the benchmark fell again on Thursday to notch a five-session losing streak, the longest since April. The S&P 500 and Dow both ended the holiday-shortened week with losses of over 1%, while the Nasdaq is facing a weekly drop of 2%. But tech stocks led Friday's rebound, as Tesla shares rose 8% after the EV maker said its sales in China climbed to a record high in 2024. Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6% on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares were up more than 4% after another sizable gain on Thursday. US Steel (X) stock slid 5% after President Joe Biden blocked Japanese buyer Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion takeover of the company, which had become a lightning rod for political opposition. On the data docket, the slump in US manufacturing lessened in December, according to new a fresh reading from the the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers Index. The figure of 49.3% is 0.9% higher than November's data, but still failed to clear the 50-point threshold, which indicated a contraction. The reading is another data glimpse into the health of US economy and will help influence the Federal Reserve's next decision on whether to cut interest rates. US stocks shook off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback, rising 8% and 4%, respectively. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Even with the win on Friday, the much-hoped-for "Santa Claus" rally failed to materialize. All three major indexes finished the holiday-shortened week with losses as the S&P and the Dow shed more than 1% for the week, while the Nasdaq gave up 2%. Mike Johnson was able to keep his spot atop the US House on Friday while seeming to offer minimal binding concessions to hard-right Republicans who had threatened his path to reelection, reports Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul What Johnson did offer — in an announcement made just before the vote — was a promise to "make meaningful spending reforms to eliminate trillions in waste, fraud, and abuse, and end the weaponization of government." It is a new effort that Johnson says will also include the formation of a new working group of independent experts set to work directly with Elon Musk’s extra-governmental "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE). It’s unclear what powers this new working group will have beyond publicizing its findings but the promise clearly helped put Johnson over the top as the opposition to him dwindled Friday afternoon. Read about the realignment of power in Washington here. Tesla shares rose more than 7% Friday as the EV maker said its sales in China climbed to a record high in 2024. The surge followed a rough day on Thursday when Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6%. Part of the drama in Tesla's high-flying stock price is the tension between the company's perception as a carmaker and its ambitions of becoming an AI-driven robotaxi service. Meanwhile, legacy automakers GM and Ford reported strong fourth quarter earnings results Friday. Ford said US sales in Q4 rose 8.8% versus a year ago, powered by F-Series sales that jumped 21.1% in the quarter. Read more on Ford's results here. GM reported Q4 sales jumped 21% from a year ago and were up 4% in 2024 to 2.7 million vehicles, with full-size pickup sales hitting their highest level since 2007. Read more about GM's earnings here. Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped as much as 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31. Rivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks — within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period, and 51,000 for the year. Even with Friday's upswing, shares are down roughly 25% from last year. Rivian has faced a number of obstacles that have sent the stock tumbling from its all-time high above $100 following the company's high-profile market debut in 2021. Read about Rivian's bounce and its rough 2024 here. Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the “Magnificent Seven” stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024, reports Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 4% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%. Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares ended 2024 up more than 150%. Analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data.

Nuclear energy stocks surged on Friday following the news that Constellation Energy (CEG) signed a pair of deals for a record $1 billion to deliver nuclear power to more than a dozen federal agencies in an agreement with the US General Services Administration. Shares of Constellation surged 4% Friday, alongside other nuclear companies. Oklo (OKLO) rose 21%; NuScale Power (SMR) rose 15%; and NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE) gained 12%. The Constellation deal is the biggest energy purchase in the history of the GSA, which is responsible for building and managing federal buildings. It also marks a step toward the government leaning into energy agreements that derive electricity from low-carbon sources, with nuclear seen as part of the transition to renewable energy. The broader market interest in nuclear power also comes as tech giants expand their power-intensive AI operations. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) shares looked for a comeback and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was poised to snap a five-day losing streak. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.3%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But all three indexes were set to post losses for the week. Carvana (CVNA) shares dropped again on Friday following a short seller report claiming the online car marketplace's turnaround is a "mirage." The stock fell more than 6% by 11:45 a.m ET Friday after losing nearly 2% in the prior session. On Thursday Hindenburg Research announced a short position on the stock in a report called "A Father-Son Accounting Grift for the Ages." The short seller alleged accounting fraud and suspicious stock sales by former CEO Ernie Garcia II. Garcia's son, Ernest Garcia III, is Carvana's current CEO. In a statement a company spokesperson said the arguments in the report were "intentionally misleading and inaccurate and have already been made numerous times by other short sellers seeking to benefit from a decline in our stock price." The Tempe, Ariz.-based car retailer underwent massive debt restructuring and cost cutting measures after its stock was crushed in late 2022 as Wall Street worried about a potential bankruptcy. The stock has attracted an abundance of short interest in recent years. Shares gained nearly 300% in 2024. The blocked $14.9 billion sale of US Steel (X) to Japan’s Nippon Steel begs the question of what comes next for the iconic Pittsburg-based steelmaker. On Friday, shares of US Steel fell more than 6% after President Biden announced his decision to to block foreign ownership of the American company. Union leaders, politicians and competitor Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) an original bidder for US Steel, have all weighed in on the merger since it was announced in 2023. “It’s been a highly politicized decision the entire way through” Josh Spoores, steel analyst at CRU Group, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. The analyst notes its unlikely Cleveland-Cliffs which has hinted it’s still interested in acquiring its competitor, would end up with the purchase. “I think it’s possible but I don’t know that US Steel would be interested or that they have to do that. They’re in a much better position today than they were a few years ago and I think US Steel is perfectly situated to run their assets as their own operator today,” said Spoores. However the analyst notes industry capacity will likely be reduced amid a backdrop of lagging steel prices. “Nippon had said they would invest and wouldn’t take anything [capacity] down. But now we’re at the point where prices are down, profits are down, it’s likely that US Steel takes down a facility,” said the analyst. Hopes that the start of the year will salvage a "Santa Claus" rally are dwindling. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off the upswing, in which the stock market historically has recorded gains from the last five sessions of December through the first two trading days of January. The rally is watched as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated an average return of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally period, with positive returns occurring 79% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical Strategist for LPL Financial. But the benchmark index is on track to lose 2% for the week. "We believe near-term downside risk remains elevated given the recent deterioration in market breadth and momentum, stretched bullish sentiment, and macro headwinds from higher rates and a stronger dollar," said Turnquist. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as markets waited for manufacturing data and Tesla (TSLA) shares struggled for a comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also up roughly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Earnings: None of note. Economic news: ISM manufacturing, ISM prices paid (December) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed: Eyes on JPMorgan (JPM) this morning after Wolfe Research upgrades the stock. What analyst Steven Chubak is saying about his upgrade: "While JPM is not a 2025 top pick, we believe shares should outperform universal broker/trust peers. When we downgraded shares alongside our second quarter 2024 preview, we believed deeper rate cuts were poised to weigh on net interest income (given JPM’s heavier short-end gearing). Since that time, rate expectations have been revised higher and we now see upside to 2026 consensus net interest income, supporting a more robust EPS growth algorithm through 2026. While absolute valuation (P/E and price to tangible book value) is still a bit frothy vs. money center peers, on our 2026 EPS we estimate that JPM trades at ~12.5x (modest premium to peers) — given the firm has consistently generated the strongest EPS growth among our bank coverage (supported by capital markets/deposit share gains), we believe a premium valuation is warranted, prompting our upgrade to out-perform."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, shaking off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Friday was the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But hopes dimmed after the benchmark fell again on Thursday to notch a five-session losing streak, the longest since April. The S&P 500 and Dow both ended the holiday-shortened week with losses of over 1%, while the Nasdaq is facing a weekly drop of 2%. But tech stocks led Friday's rebound, as Tesla shares rose 8% after the EV maker said its sales in China climbed to a record high in 2024. Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6% on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares were up more than 4% after another sizable gain on Thursday. US Steel (X) stock slid 5% after President Joe Biden blocked Japanese buyer Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion takeover of the company, which had become a lightning rod for political opposition. On the data docket, the slump in US manufacturing lessened in December, according to new a fresh reading from the the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers Index. The figure of 49.3% is 0.9% higher than November's data, but still failed to clear the 50-point threshold, which indicated a contraction. The reading is another data glimpse into the health of US economy and will help influence the Federal Reserve's next decision on whether to cut interest rates. US stocks shook off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback, rising 8% and 4%, respectively. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Even with the win on Friday, the much-hoped-for "Santa Claus" rally failed to materialize. All three major indexes finished the holiday-shortened week with losses as the S&P and the Dow shed more than 1% for the week, while the Nasdaq gave up 2%. Mike Johnson was able to keep his spot atop the US House on Friday while seeming to offer minimal binding concessions to hard-right Republicans who had threatened his path to reelection, reports Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul What Johnson did offer — in an announcement made just before the vote — was a promise to "make meaningful spending reforms to eliminate trillions in waste, fraud, and abuse, and end the weaponization of government." It is a new effort that Johnson says will also include the formation of a new working group of independent experts set to work directly with Elon Musk’s extra-governmental "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE). It’s unclear what powers this new working group will have beyond publicizing its findings but the promise clearly helped put Johnson over the top as the opposition to him dwindled Friday afternoon.

The surge followed a rough day on Thursday when Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6%. Part of the drama in Tesla's high-flying stock price is the tension between the company's perception as a carmaker and its ambitions of becoming an AI-driven robotaxi service. Meanwhile, legacy automakers GM and Ford reported strong fourth quarter earnings results Friday. Ford said US sales in Q4 rose 8.8% versus a year ago, powered by F-Series sales that jumped 21.1% in the quarter. Read more on Ford's results here. GM reported Q4 sales jumped 21% from a year ago and were up 4% in 2024 to 2.7 million vehicles, with full-size pickup sales hitting their highest level since 2007. Read more about GM's earnings here. Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped as much as 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31. Rivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks — within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period, and 51,000 for the year. Even with Friday's upswing, shares are down roughly 25% from last year. Rivian has faced a number of obstacles that have sent the stock tumbling from its all-time high above $100 following the company's high-profile market debut in 2021. Read about Rivian's bounce and its rough 2024 here. Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the “Magnificent Seven” stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024, reports Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 4% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%. Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares ended 2024 up more than 150%. Analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data. Read more about Nvidia's stock performance here. Nuclear energy stocks surged on Friday following the news that Constellation Energy (CEG) signed a pair of deals for a record $1 billion to deliver nuclear power to more than a dozen federal agencies in an agreement with the US General Services Administration. Shares of Constellation surged 4% Friday, alongside other nuclear companies. Oklo (OKLO) rose 21%; NuScale Power (SMR) rose 15%; and NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE) gained 12%. The Constellation deal is the biggest energy purchase in the history of the GSA, which is responsible for building and managing federal buildings. It also marks a step toward the government leaning into energy agreements that derive electricity from low-carbon sources, with nuclear seen as part of the transition to renewable energy.

US stocks stepped higher on Friday, shaking off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) shares looked for a comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.7%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But hopes are dim after the benchmark fell again on Thursday to notch a five-session losing streak, the longest since April. The S&P 500 and Dow are both on track to end the holiday-shortened week with losses of over 1%, while the Nasdaq is facing a weekly drop of 2%. Meanwhile, Tesla shares rose after the EV maker said its sales in China climbed to a record high in 2024. Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6% on Thursday. US Steel (X) stock slid 5% after President Joe Biden blocked Japanese buyer Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion takeover of the company, which had become a lightning rod for political opposition. On the data docket, the slump in US manufacturing lessened in December, according to new a fresh reading from the the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers Index. The figure of 49.3% is 0.9% higher than November's data, but still failed to clear the 50-point threshold, which indicated a contraction. The reading is another data glimpse into the health of US economy and will help influence the Federal Reserve's next decision on whether to cut interest rates. Tesla shares rose more than 7% Friday as the EV maker said its sales in China climbed to a record high in 2024. The surge followed a rough day on Thursday when Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6%. Part of the drama in Tesla's high-flying stock price is the tension between the company' perception as a car maker and its ambitions of becoming an AI-driven robotaxi service. Meanwhile, legacy automakers GM and Ford reported strong fourth quarter earnings results Friday. Ford said US sales in Q4 rose 8.8% versus a year ago, powered by F-Series sales that jumped 21.1% in the quarter. Read more on Ford's results here. GM reported Q4 sales jumped 21% from a year ago and were up 4% in 2024 to 2.7 million vehicles, with full-size pickup sales hitting their highest level since 2007. Read more about GM's earnings here. Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped as much as 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31. Rivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks — within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period, and 51,000 for the year. Even with Friday's upswing, shares are down roughly 25% from last year. Rivian has faced a number of obstacles that have sent the stock tumbling from its all-time high above $100 following the company's high-profile market debut in 2021. Read about Rivian's bounce and its rough 2024 here. Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the “Magnificent Seven” stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024, reports Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 4% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%. Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares ended 2024 up more than 150%. Analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data. Read more about Nvidia's stock performance here. Nuclear energy stocks surged on Friday following the news that Constellation Energy (CEG) signed a pair of deals for a record $1 billion to deliver nuclear power to more than a dozen federal agencies in an agreement with the US General Services Administration. Shares of Constellation surged 4% Friday, alongside other nuclear companies. Oklo (OKLO) rose 21%; NuScale Power (SMR) rose 15%; and NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE) gained 12%. The Constellation deal is the biggest energy purchase in the history of the GSA, which is responsible for building and managing federal buildings. It also marks a step toward the government leaning into energy agreements that derive electricity from low-carbon sources, with nuclear seen as part of the transition to renewable energy. The broader market interest in nuclear power also comes as tech giants expand their power-intensive AI operations. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) shares looked for a comeback and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was poised to snap a five-day losing streak. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.3%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But all three indexes were set to post losses for the week. Carvana (CVNA) shares dropped again on Friday following a short seller report claiming the online car marketplace's turnaround is a "mirage." The stock fell more than 6% by 11:45 a.m ET Friday after losing nearly 2% in the prior session. On Thursday Hindenburg Research announced a short position on the stock in a report called "A Father-Son Accounting Grift for the Ages." The short seller alleged accounting fraud and suspicious stock sales by former CEO Ernie Garcia II. Garcia's son, Ernest Garcia III, is Carvana's current CEO. In a statement a company spokesperson said the arguments in the report were "intentionally misleading and inaccurate and have already been made numerous times by other short sellers seeking to benefit from a decline in our stock price." The Tempe, Ariz.-based car retailer underwent massive debt restructuring and cost cutting measures after its stock was crushed in late 2022 as Wall Street worried about a potential bankruptcy. The stock has attracted an abundance of short interest in recent years. Shares gained nearly 300% in 2024. The blocked $14.9 billion sale of US Steel (X) to Japan’s Nippon Steel begs the question of what comes next for the iconic Pittsburg-based steelmaker. On Friday, shares of US Steel fell more than 6% after President Biden announced his decision to to block foreign ownership of the American company. Union leaders, politicians and competitor Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) an original bidder for US Steel, have all weighed in on the merger since it was announced in 2023. “It’s been a highly politicized decision the entire way through” Josh Spoores, steel analyst at CRU Group, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. The analyst notes its unlikely Cleveland-Cliffs which has hinted it’s still interested in acquiring its competitor, would end up with the purchase. “I think it’s possible but I don’t know that US Steel would be interested or that they have to do that. They’re in a much better position today than they were a few years ago and I think US Steel is perfectly situated to run their assets as their own operator today,” said Spoores. However the analyst notes industry capacity will likely be reduced amid a backdrop of lagging steel prices. “Nippon had said they would invest and wouldn’t take anything [capacity] down. But now we’re at the point where prices are down, profits are down, it’s likely that US Steel takes down a facility,” said the analyst. Hopes that the start of the year will salvage a "Santa Claus" rally are dwindling. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off the upswing, in which the stock market historically has recorded gains from the last five sessions of December through the first two trading days of January. The rally is watched as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated an average return of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally period, with positive returns occurring 79% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical Strategist for LPL Financial. But the benchmark index is on track to lose 2% for the week. "We believe near-term downside risk remains elevated given the recent deterioration in market breadth and momentum, stretched bullish sentiment, and macro headwinds from higher rates and a stronger dollar," said Turnquist. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as markets waited for manufacturing data and Tesla (TSLA) shares struggled for a comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also up roughly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Earnings: None of note. Economic news: ISM manufacturing, ISM prices paid (December) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed: Eyes on JPMorgan (JPM) this morning after Wolfe Research upgrades the stock. What analyst Steven Chubak is saying about his upgrade: "While JPM is not a 2025 top pick, we believe shares should outperform universal broker/trust peers. When we downgraded shares alongside our second quarter 2024 preview, we believed deeper rate cuts were poised to weigh on net interest income (given JPM’s heavier short-end gearing). Since that time, rate expectations have been revised higher and we now see upside to 2026 consensus net interest income, supporting a more robust EPS growth algorithm through 2026. While absolute valuation (P/E and price to tangible book value) is still a bit frothy vs. money center peers, on our 2026 EPS we estimate that JPM trades at ~12.5x (modest premium to peers) — given the firm has consistently generated the strongest EPS growth among our bank coverage (supported by capital markets/deposit share gains), we believe a premium valuation is warranted, prompting our upgrade to out-perform." JPM shares are up about 1% in premarket trading. Sign in to access your portfolio

The S&P 500 and Dow both ended the holiday-shortened week with losses of over 1%, while the Nasdaq is facing a weekly drop of 2%.

Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6% on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares were up more than 4% after another sizable gain on Thursday.

Even with the win on Friday, the much-hoped-for "Santa Claus" rally failed to materialize. All three major indexes finished the holiday-shortened week with losses as the S&P and the Dow shed more than 1% for the week, while the Nasdaq gave up 2%. Mike Johnson was able to keep his spot atop the US House on Friday while seeming to offer minimal binding concessions to hard-right Republicans who had threatened his path to reelection, reports Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul What Johnson did offer — in an announcement made just before the vote — was a promise to "make meaningful spending reforms to eliminate trillions in waste, fraud, and abuse, and end the weaponization of government." It is a new effort that Johnson says will also include the formation of a new working group of independent experts set to work directly with Elon Musk’s extra-governmental "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE). It’s unclear what powers this new working group will have beyond publicizing its findings but the promise clearly helped put Johnson over the top as the opposition to him dwindled Friday afternoon.

On Friday, shares of US Steel fell more than 6% after President Biden announced his decision to to block foreign ownership of the American company. Union leaders, politicians and competitor Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) an original bidder for US Steel, have all weighed in on the merger since it was announced in 2023. “It’s been a highly politicized decision the entire way through” Josh Spoores, steel analyst at CRU Group, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. The analyst notes its unlikely Cleveland-Cliffs which has hinted it’s still interested in acquiring its competitor, would end up with the purchase. “I think it’s possible but I don’t know that US Steel would be interested or that they have to do that. They’re in a much better position today than they were a few years ago and I think US Steel is perfectly situated to run their assets as their own operator today,” said Spoores. However the analyst notes industry capacity will likely be reduced amid a backdrop of lagging steel prices. “Nippon had said they would invest and wouldn’t take anything [capacity] down. But now we’re at the point where prices are down, profits are down, it’s likely that US Steel takes down a facility,” said the analyst. Hopes that the start of the year will salvage a "Santa Claus" rally are dwindling. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off the upswing, in which the stock market historically has recorded gains from the last five sessions of December through the first two trading days of January. The rally is watched as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated an average return of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally period, with positive returns occurring 79% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical Strategist for LPL Financial. But the benchmark index is on track to lose 2% for the week. "We believe near-term downside risk remains elevated given the recent deterioration in market breadth and momentum, stretched bullish sentiment, and macro headwinds from higher rates and a stronger dollar," said Turnquist. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as markets waited for manufacturing data and Tesla (TSLA) shares struggled for a comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also up roughly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%.

What analyst Steven Chubak is saying about his upgrade: "While JPM is not a 2025 top pick, we believe shares should outperform universal broker/trust peers. When we downgraded shares alongside our second quarter 2024 preview, we believed deeper rate cuts were poised to weigh on net interest income (given JPM’s heavier short-end gearing).

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, shaking off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Friday was the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But hopes dimmed after the benchmark fell again on Thursday to notch a five-session losing streak, the longest since April. The S&P 500 and Dow both ended the holiday-shortened week with losses of over 1%, while the Nasdaq is facing a weekly drop of 2%. But tech stocks led Friday's rebound, as Tesla shares rose 8% after the EV maker said its sales in China climbed to a record high in 2024. Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6% on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares were up more than 4% after another sizable gain on Thursday. US Steel (X) stock slid 5% after President Joe Biden blocked Japanese buyer Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion takeover of the company, which had become a lightning rod for political opposition. On the data docket, the slump in US manufacturing lessened in December, according to new a fresh reading from the the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers Index. The figure of 49.3% is 0.9% higher than November's data, but still failed to clear the 50-point threshold, which indicated a contraction. The reading is another data glimpse into the health of US economy and will help influence the Federal Reserve's next decision on whether to cut interest rates. US stocks shook off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback, rising 8% and 4%, respectively. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Even with the win on Friday, the much-hoped-for "Santa Claus" rally failed to materialize. All three major indexes finished the holiday-shortened week with losses as the S&P and the Dow shed more than 1% for the week, while the Nasdaq gave up 2%. Mike Johnson was able to keep his spot atop the US House on Friday while seeming to offer minimal binding concessions to hard-right Republicans who had threatened his path to reelection, reports Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul What Johnson did offer — in an announcement made just before the vote — was a promise to "make meaningful spending reforms to eliminate trillions in waste, fraud, and abuse, and end the weaponization of government." It is a new effort that Johnson says will also include the formation of a new working group of independent experts set to work directly with Elon Musk’s extra-governmental "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE). It’s unclear what powers this new working group will have beyond publicizing its findings but the promise clearly helped put Johnson over the top as the opposition to him dwindled Friday afternoon.

The surge followed a rough day on Thursday when Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6%. Part of the drama in Tesla's high-flying stock price is the tension between the company's perception as a carmaker and its ambitions of becoming an AI-driven robotaxi service. Meanwhile, legacy automakers GM and Ford reported strong fourth quarter earnings results Friday. Ford said US sales in Q4 rose 8.8% versus a year ago, powered by F-Series sales that jumped 21.1% in the quarter. Read more on Ford's results here. GM reported Q4 sales jumped 21% from a year ago and were up 4% in 2024 to 2.7 million vehicles, with full-size pickup sales hitting their highest level since 2007. Read more about GM's earnings here. Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped as much as 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31. Rivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks — within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period, and 51,000 for the year. Even with Friday's upswing, shares are down roughly 25% from last year. Rivian has faced a number of obstacles that have sent the stock tumbling from its all-time high above $100 following the company's high-profile market debut in 2021. Read about Rivian's bounce and its rough 2024 here. Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the “Magnificent Seven” stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024, reports Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 4% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%. Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares ended 2024 up more than 150%. Analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data. Read more about Nvidia's stock performance here. Nuclear energy stocks surged on Friday following the news that Constellation Energy (CEG) signed a pair of deals for a record $1 billion to deliver nuclear power to more than a dozen federal agencies in an agreement with the US General Services Administration. Shares of Constellation surged 4% Friday, alongside other nuclear companies. Oklo (OKLO) rose 21%; NuScale Power (SMR) rose 15%; and NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE) gained 12%. The Constellation deal is the biggest energy purchase in the history of the GSA, which is responsible for building and managing federal buildings. It also marks a step toward the government leaning into energy agreements that derive electricity from low-carbon sources, with nuclear seen as part of the transition to renewable energy. The broader market interest in nuclear power also comes as tech giants expand their power-intensive AI operations. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) shares looked for a comeback and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was poised to snap a five-day losing streak. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.3%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But all three indexes were set to post losses for the week. Carvana (CVNA) shares dropped again on Friday following a short seller report claiming the online car marketplace's turnaround is a "mirage." The stock fell more than 6% by 11:45 a.m ET Friday after losing nearly 2% in the prior session. On Thursday Hindenburg Research announced a short position on the stock in a report called "A Father-Son Accounting Grift for the Ages." The short seller alleged accounting fraud and suspicious stock sales by former CEO Ernie Garcia II. Garcia's son, Ernest Garcia III, is Carvana's current CEO. In a statement a company spokesperson said the arguments in the report were "intentionally misleading and inaccurate and have already been made numerous times by other short sellers seeking to benefit from a decline in our stock price." The Tempe, Ariz.-based car retailer underwent massive debt restructuring and cost cutting measures after its stock was crushed in late 2022 as Wall Street worried about a potential bankruptcy. The stock has attracted an abundance of short interest in recent years. Shares gained nearly 300% in 2024. The blocked $14.9 billion sale of US Steel (X) to Japan’s Nippon Steel begs the question of what comes next for the iconic Pittsburg-based steelmaker. On Friday, shares of US Steel fell more than 6% after President Biden announced his decision to to block foreign ownership of the American company.

Title: Analyst raises Tesla price target, maintains Buy rating despite deliveries miss

Canaccord Genuity has lifted its Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock price target to $404 from $298, maintaining a Buy rating despite weaker-than-expected deliveries in the fourth quarter. The move comes as the financial services firm remains confident about the carmaker’s long-term growth potential and the upcoming product launches. According to Canaccord’s Thursday note, the new target price is based on 40x Canaccord’s 2027E non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) estimate of $10.11, compared to a previous multiple of ~34x on 2026E EPS. “We feel this multiple is justified based on the multiples and growth rates of Tesla’s comp set — which we deem to be a group of megacap tech stocks, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA),” analyst George Gianarikas said in the note. “This set of companies trades at a median of ~23x 2027E EPS but has a combined revenue growth rate ~half of Tesla’s from 2025-2027,” he added. Tesla’s latest delivery results were below expectations. The company reported 4Q24 deliveries of around 495,600, representing 7.1% sequential growth but falling short of Canaccord’s estimate of ~533,000 and the consensus estimate of ~498,000. Tesla’s production in the same quarter declined by 2.2% sequentially to ~459,500 units. Canaccord’s decision to maintain its bullish stance centers on new product introductions slated for 2025. Tesla has guided for new vehicles and anticipates 20-30% year-over-year unit volume growth. “Tesla tends to deliver excitement when it refreshes its portfolio,” the note stated. This growth potential, combined with signs of bottoming auto gross margins, supports Canaccord’s positive outlook. Tesla reduced the cost of goods sold per vehicle to $35,100 in 3Q24, the lowest in the company’s history. “We’ll see how new products impact the mix — but we do forecast improving margins in 2025,” Gianarikas said. Canaccord also highlighted advances in Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. While the firm remains cautious about timelines for robotaxi deployments, recent updates to FSD have been described as “unbelievable, incredible” by users, signaling potential for higher adoption rates. “An increase in FSD adoption could positively impact Tesla's profit margins and bolster confidence in the company's ability to monetize its substantial investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure,” the analyst continued. Moreover, Tesla’s energy storage segment remains a bright spot. Deployments surged to about 11.0 GWh in 4Q24, up 59.4% sequentially and 243.5% year-over-year. The construction of Tesla’s Shanghai Megafactory was completed in late 2024, and production is expected to ramp up in 1Q25. Lastly, Canaccord points to the potential in the robotics sector for Tesla, emphasizing it sees 2025 “as the year of the robot.” “We see increasing support for Tesla’s earnings multiple based on its leadership in this burgeoning sector.”

Title: A $24 Billion Fund Puts Its Religious Stamp on Corporate America

Jim Lake, a devout Christian in Washington state, said his religious beliefs have always made him opposed to practices such as abortion, transgender transitions or embryonic stem cell research. But until this past year, it didn’t cross the retiree’s mind that he could put his money to work with his faith. A financial adviser switched Lake’s portfolio over to a handful of faith-friendly funds, one of which was run by GuideStone Funds, a 106-year-old investment firm in Texas that oversees some $24 billion in assets. The company caters to Southern Baptist retirees and, increasingly, newly active faith-based investors such as Lake and his wife. GuideStone is part of a nascent coalition of conservative Christian investors that are starting to flex their muscles and use their shareholder clout to counter progressive corporate policies such as funding Pride parades or covering employees’ travel costs for abortions. They’re also zeroing in on banks for allegedly closing customer accounts on political and religious grounds. By some measures, there’s now half a trillion dollars in investments spread across conservative faith-based private funds and state pension funds that can be brought to bear to influence company behavior, said Will Lofland, who oversees shareholder advocacy at GuideStone. The loose confederation includes Inspire Investing, the biggest faith-based exchange-traded fund manager; Republican state treasurers and teacher pension funds; and Alliance Defending Freedom, an influential conservative legal group. As they attract more money, members of the coalition are meeting with corporate executives and filing shareholder proposals. They’ve had limited success so far, yet aim to build their bloc of supporters and target more companies this year, Lofland said. The investors “want to honor the Lord with all of their resources,” he said. “They want their dollars being invested in what they believe is the God-honoring way.” Religious investing has been around for decades, often with a focus on more liberal issues such as worker rights and climate change. But funds such as GuideStone have been emboldened by the rightward shift of US politics and the wave of conservative activists and lawyers who have already pushed companies to curtail or end programs that support diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Many point to anti-DEI activist Robby Starbuck, a non-denominational Christian, and his success in getting companies such as Walmart Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Harley-Davidson Inc. to backtrack on initiatives — particularly those related to LGBTQ causes. Among everyday investors, there is growing interest in religious-based funds, said Tim Macready, head of global multi asset investing at Brightlight, which advises investors on faith-based portfolios. Assets in faith-friendly ETFs and mutual funds exceeded $100 billion for the first time last year, according to annual study conducted by the firm. The analysis, compiled from 27 faith-based asset mangers, likely captures only a portion of the activity. The full universe could range from $200 billion to $500 billion, Macready said. Net inflows have been 12% over the last three years, he said. One broker-dealer went from 200 advisers working with GuideStone in 2021 to more than 2,000 now, Lofland said. Inspire said it had net new assets of $334 million last year. GuideStone’s biggest fund, the GuideStone Equity Index Fund, gained 20% last year, slightly underperforming the S&P 500 Index. Lake, a 64-year-old resident of Nine Mile Falls, Washington, invested with GuideStone after being introduced to an adviser whose sole practice is working with people investing in faith-friendly funds. “It really opened up my eyes to the ability to remain faith-friendly and at the same time, be competitive,” Lake said. Building a Bloc GuideStone operates out of a nondescript office building overlooking a freeway in northern Dallas, and maintained such a low profile that Lofland said he didn’t know about the funds until he applied to work there. The firm mainly manages pension investments for Baptist churches, yet Lofland saw an opportunity to become more active. Shareholder proposals from progressive groups, some pushing ideas such as transgender benefits contrary to the church’s values, started to proliferate a few years ago and GuideStone wasn’t voting its shares to oppose such measures, Lofland said. He decided to take control of how GuideStone voted on the shares it owns in companies rather than relying on outside advisers. One of the investor’s first efforts was in late 2023, when it backed a shareholder proposal from a conservative group asking Microsoft Corp. to report on compensation and benefit gaps across genders as the company addressed reproductive and gender dysphoria care. The resolution won only 1% of votes. (Bloomberg Intelligence says overall support for conservative proposals at US companies is only about 2%.) Lofland says that’s why the religious funds need to build a bigger group of supporters, particularly from pension funds from conservative states. Such investors have already done some agitating of their own: Last year, finance officials from 15 states signed a letter to Fortune 1000 companies in support of ending DEI programs. Collectively, they managed about $590 billion, according to US Census data. That type of firepower is needed to counter efforts that have strong progressive backing. In July, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander urged five large retailers, including Walmart and Costco Wholesale Corp., to dispense abortion pills. City funds controlled $1.3 billion in shares of those companies, he said. A coalition of conservatives and religious investors, including Inspire and GuideStone, responded with their own letter the following month saying offering the pill would add risk, but only represented $172 million in shares of those retailers. Lofland said GuideStone’s first initiative in 2025 will be to press a financial firm regarding the practice of debanking — the closure of customer accounts that are deemed by lenders to pose legal or reputational risks. He declined to name the bank. GuideStone had previously supported other group’s efforts to pressure JPMorgan Chase & Co. after the lender was accused of improperly closing accounts for the nonprofit National Committee for Religious Freedom. Michael Fusco, a spokesman for the bank, said “we have never and would never close an account for political or religious reasons, period.” Lawsuits, Proxy Votes Inspire Investing and Knights of Columbus are among other faith-based investors working to influence corporate behavior. Inspire joined a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group run by Trump advisor Stephen Miller against Target Corp. that accuses the retailer of costing investors billions of dollars after its sale of LGBTQ merchandise led to a consumer boycott. Last month, a federal judge denied a motion to dismiss the case and change its venue out of Florida. Target, which in response cut LGBTQ-themed products from some its stores, declined to comment. Inspire, which oversees about $3.2 billion, last year filed almost two dozen shareholder resolutions over DEI topics. It plans to file more in 2025. “As stewards of what we believe are God’s dollars, it’s our job to speak Biblical truth to corporate power,” said Robert Netzly, founder of the Meridian, Idaho-based investment firm. Knights of Columbus is working to develop proxy voting rules that follow guidelines established by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said Anthony Minopoli, president and chief investment officer of Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors, which manages about $28 billion. The group is partnering with the Busch School of Business at the Catholic University of America on the effort, which aims to get Catholic dioceses to adopt the guidelines to ensure they are voting based on the beliefs of the church. The group also will likely engage with companies on topics ranging from abortion to the manufacture of land mines and cluster bombs, which violate church values as set forward by USCCB, Minopoli said. Even if the coalitions of conservative and religious groups don’t get strong shareholder support for their proposals, they will likely succeed in swaying corporate executives, according to Amelia Miazad, an acting law professor at University of California, Davis who is researching a project on faith-based investors. She likened the efforts to the backlash to environmental, social and governance strategies, which has seen asset management giants including BlackRock Inc. cut the number of new funds with that mandate. “If success means silencing corporate speech on environmental and social issues, then these investors will be as successful as the anti-ESG movement has been,” she said.

Our goal is to improve Project Management (PM) profitability and reduce discrepancies in information among stakeholders, which can result in conflicts. This will be accomplished by incorporating Earned Value Management (EVM) with the Income Statement and incorporating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) with the work breakdown structure (WBS). These incorporations will streamline information sharing between PM, other management professionals, and the stakeholders, ultimately fostering the application of PM within broader business and management contexts. We drew on theories from Project, Operations, Financial Management, Agency Theory, and the Theory of Performance Frontiers. We conducted multiple case studies in a shipbuilding corporation with 25 projects and an aircraft manufacturing corporation with 20 projects. Our analysis involved both qualitative and quantitative methods, ensuring the accuracy and practicality of our hypotheses and instilling confidence in our research findings. This integration addresses the information gap on profitability for non-project management professionals, empowering stakeholders to enhance project performance. This integration benefits the company by allowing the project manager and stakeholders to gain real-time insights into the project’s profitability, which enables continuous optimization of daily EBITDA by improving efficiency and productivity to achieve the project’s profitability target. This study and its innovative findings originate from the author’s unique approach, which is a significant contribution to the field of Project Management. This research focused on project management using EVM in for-profit organizations. Integrating EVM in the income statement also facilitates PM application in other management systems.

Project management is a well-established field that deals with complex tasks within tight constraints [1, 2]. It is integral to modern management with strong theoretical foundations and scientific rigor [3–5]. Despite its importance, project management research receives little attention in leading business and management journals. The project management manifesto encourages collaboration between social scientists and urges business and management experts to make project research more relevant to society [3]. The use of EVM in project management has grown but is not widely accepted in business due to its limitations in addressing quality, uncertainty, and profitability [2, 3]. Current EVM indicators are limited and need enhancement. Profitability measurements are missing, creating a lack of real-time awareness among project managers and potential conflicts with stakeholders [4]. Upon analysis, it’s clear that EVM lacks profitability indicators. This hampers managers’ real-time understanding of project profitability, leading to reliance on financial reports later. This knowledge gap among managers can create conflicts. Our research suggests integrating EBITDA into EVM to maximize daily EBITDA in all processes, WBS, and work packages for improved performance and profitability. Our study utilized multiple embedded case studies within complex defense industries in a shipbuilding corporation with 25 projects and an aircraft manufacturing corporation with 20 projects. We collected and analyzed qualitative data through NVivo interviews and quantitative data through SPSS surveys. Data collection took place over a longitudinal time horizon. We aim to improve EVM by integrating it into the income statement and linking EBITDA to WBS and work packages to provide timely profitability information, enhance daily performance, and broaden the practical application of project management. This research has implications for real-world implementation in business and management. This study focuses on both profit-driven and not-for-profit organizations, as both need to secure operational earnings for sustainable success. However, the study does not delve into the measurement of interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization in project management, nor does it explore the role of project management in valuations such as mergers and acquisitions. The novelty of this research lies in integrating EVM into the income statement and EBITDA into the WBS, enhancing project management profitability and applying EVM–PM in other business and management fields, which is the author’s innovation. The integration of EVM into income statements and EBITDA into WBS not only combines the project management and financial systems but also integrates the language of both fields, enabling leaders to foster a strong corporate culture, improve efficiency, and enhance productivity for better performance and profitability. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 1, Introduction, and Section 2. Literature Review and Section 3 Research Methods. Then we will have Section 4, Result and Discussion, and finally, Section 5 is the conclusion. The upcoming section will provide a comprehensive review of how to enhance Project Management (PM) profitability and elevate PM applications in other business and management fields. Firstly, we will explore project-based firms (PBF), projects, and Earned Value Management (EVM), including components such as Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Work Packages. We will also delve into Agency Theory, which covers the roles of principals (Project Owners) and agents (Contractors) and how information gaps about profitability can lead to conflicts among stakeholders. Additionally, we will discuss the disparity between PM language and financial literacy, such as Earnings Before Interests, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) among stakeholders, and its impact on information asymmetry using the theory of Productivity Frontiers. To address Research Question 1, we need to answer research questions 2, 3, 4, and 5 to understand the practical application of EVM in business management. Therefore, we will delve into topics such as Project Based Firm (PBF), Agency Theory, and Information Asymmetry in Section 2.1. Fig 1 visually presents the five steps to incorporate Project Management EVM with the Income Statement. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g001 In section 2.2, our focus is on the integration of EVM into the Income Statement, a crucial step to improve Project Management profitability. In Section 2.3, we will explore the appropriateness of EBITDA as the Primary Profitability indicator of PM. Section 2.4 will discuss how to integrate EVM–Income Statement and EBITDA to enhance profitability, and Section 2.5 will delve into how to maximize PM daily EBITDA. Furthermore, section 2.6 will discuss the benefit of using EBITDA in the EVM-PM. Section 2.7 will discuss enhancing EVM-Income Statement—EBITDA in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to support PM. Additionally, we will organize the literature from section 2.1 until section 2.5 and define the boundary of the study that focuses on PM from the agents (contractors’) perspectives and exclude the discussion of project owner benefits that may result from the project usage after PM completion. We also exclude discussing managing interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization for corporation valuations. Finally, in section 2.8, we will summarize how to elevate PM applications by integrating EVM with income statements and WBS—EBITDA into other business and management fields and summarize the hypothesis we built during the literature review. Project management is a complex field that aims to deliver cost-effective, high-quality, timely, and safe products [4, 6–10]. Frontier analysis identifies best-in-class companies and areas for improvement, driving continuous improvement and providing a competitive advantage [11]. We will explore how to enhance the use of EVM beyond project management and traditional methods [4], to prioritize project management efficiency, productivity, and profitability from the outset. Project management is crucial for project-based firms (PBFs) to enhance employee performance and execute projects effectively [2]. It extends to encompass internal and external stakeholders with diverse expectations [3]. Agency theory provides insights into inter-organizational relationships, highlighting the importance of aligning the principal’s and agent’s value propositions to achieve optimal project management outcomes [12]. Prioritizing diverse stakeholders and promoting transparent communication are essential. Information asymmetry arises when one party possesses information they do not openly share. However, such information asymmetry can give rise to opportunistic behavior [13, 14], typically exhibited by the agent [15] and sometimes by the principal [16]. RQ1. How can a company integrate EVM into Income Statement to improve Project Management Profitability and elevate application in the Business and Management? To answer Research Question 1 (RQ1), we split it into three RQ as follows: Further we will study the literature to answer RQ1. 1 by studying seven layers of Income Statements (I/S) framework. The income statement, also known as the profit and loss statement, is a vital financial reporting tool for businesses and management, providing crucial insights into costs, benefits, and operational profitability [17–21]. The seven-step income statement structure, depicted in Fig 1, serves as a valuable framework. The process starts with revenue, direct operating costs, and gross profit, a key measure of operational profitability. However, it is important to note that gross profit does not account for indirect operating costs [22], and should not be the sole measure of operating profitability. On the other hand, EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) includes all operating costs, including depreciation and amortization. Although depreciation and amortization are considered operating costs, they are not directly controlled by project managers but rather by the board of directors (BOD) [23, 24]. Thus, we do not recommend using EBIT as a profitability objective for daily project management activities, as daily depreciation and amortization are fixed costs not within the control of project managers. EBITDA includes direct and indirect operating costs but excludes interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization. Company EBITDA is solely under company operational control, and PM EBITDA is under project managers’ control. EBITDA can be used to measure operational efficiency, productivity, and profitability [24, 25], making it a valuable key performance indicator (KPI) for project management. Our next step will be to delve into its suitability as a KPI in PM and investigate how to integrate EVM with the income statement framework. It is essential to recognize the significance of PM profitability for its success, growth, and continual operation [26]. Thus, it is crucial to grasp the terminology of profitability measures in Earned Value Management (EVM) and align them with the profit and loss framework, as depicted in Fig 2. EVM is a comprehensive system that compares actual and budgeted work values, time, and costs. Through the integration of time and cost perspectives, EVM assesses schedule and cost performance, calculates variances, and forecasts total cost and duration [2, 7, 27–33]. (Author’s property). (Author’s property). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g002 Fig 2 illustrates several EVM indicators, including Planned Value (PV) as the "budgeted cost of work scheduled" (BCWS), Earned Value (EV) as the "budgeted cost of work performed" (BCWP), and Actual Costs (AC) as the "actual costs of work performed" (ACWP) [27, 29–32, 34, 35]. The Earned Value Management (EVM) method lacks profitability indicators, leading to information imbalances among stakeholders. Integrating profitability indicators into EVM will enhance transparency and support from stakeholders [18]. Additionally, the EVM method does not consider revenue, using the term "budget" instead, necessitating the inclusion of a baseline for production and profitability [26]. The interpretation of Planned Value (PV) varies based on perspective. For effective management of profit-driven organizations, it is crucial for a contractor’s planned cost to differ from the planned revenue received from the owner. Setting a zero-profitability target may not motivate project managers to prioritize profit, and an unclear buffer between revenue and cost may lead to cost overruns. Project managers (PMs) can utilize EBITDA as a buffer between revenues and costs to address this issue. This buffer can be represented by the equation: Planned cost = planned revenue minus planned EBITDA. By integrating the EBITDA target as a profitability goal, the project manager can effectively manage profitability and intervene early if necessary [33, 36]. Moreover, incorporating buffer into the EVM system can positively impact profitability [37]. In Fig 2, we illustrate the integration of EVM into the Income Statement and the incorporation of EBITDA into the framework. Incorporating EBITDA into EVM can streamline accounting processes and enable direct project performance management. However, it’s important to evaluate the relevance of using EBITDA as a KPI in project management before implementation [38, 39]. Within this framework, our objective was to verify the suitability of EBITDA as a KPI in PM. In addressing the second research question, we explore the significance of profitability for project management activities and introduce some terminology related to operational profitability. Fig 3 vividly illustrates the seven crucial steps of an Income Statement. It begins with sales activity, effectively generating revenue. The next step involves the Company’s core operations, which consume direct operational costs, encompassing both variable and fixed costs, culminating in the creation of gross profit. The third step involves the Company Supporting Units engaging in Indirect Operations activities, such as General Administration, and consuming Indirect Operating Costs resulting in EBITDA (Earnings Before interest, depreciation, and amortization). Finally, the decision to expense Depreciation and Amortization by the Board of Directors leads to EBIT (Earnings Before Interests and Tax), also called Operating Profit [25, 40]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g003 Noticeably, the Company’s operations management authority is confined to specific operational expenses, as control over Depreciation and Amortization expenses rests with the Board of Directors. The decision to account for Depreciation, Amortization, Interest, and Tax falls within the Board of Directors’ purview, limiting the Operations Management’s jurisdiction to EBITDA. Consequently, operations management has no complete control over operating profit expenses because it excludes depreciation from its jurisdiction. The ultimate earnings that operations management can deliver is EBITDA [25, 40]. The frontier approach assesses performance using managerial benchmarks and theoretical perspectives. The production frontier represents the highest level of performance achievable by an operational unit based on its operational decisions (Vastag, 2000). EBITDA can be a critical operational management performance indicator (KPI), representing the profitability frontier under their direct control. In addition, Fig 3 illustrates the correlations between earnings metrics, such as Earning Before Tax (EBT), Earnings After Tax (EAT) or Net Profit, and Retained Earnings, and management authority and control. This illustration highlights the essential role of operational management in achieving profitability and control [25, 40]. Critics of EBITDA as a company indicator argue that it is an inadequate measure for evaluating investment activities since it requires consideration of other indicators and is not a reliable proxy for net cash flow [41]. Additionally, some argue that EBITDA is insufficient for guiding financial strategies and valuation decisions such as bankruptcy, mergers, and acquisitions [42–45]. On the other hand, advocates of EBITDA as an indicator maintain that it is a suitable measure of a company’s operations and project management profitability, reflecting the ultimate profitability that only operations management and project management can achieve [41, 46–50]. A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a crucial metric used to gauge the achievement of critical objectives and is essential for understanding and enhancing performance [51]. EBITDA is a performance metric that assesses a company’s profitability by excluding factors such as taxes, interest, and debt costs [23, 52]. It is a reliable indicator of operational effectiveness and is well-suited as a profitability metric for evaluating operational management [53]. It’s important to align performance dimensions with company practices such as knowledge management, openness, and sustainability [54]. Performance measurement involves assessing effectiveness and efficiency using specific measures [55]. EBITDA is crucial for operational management and integrating it into earned value management (EVM) can help project managers plan and control financial targets. An effective performance management system should incorporate a limited number of KPIs to provide a comprehensive view of company performance and prevent information overload [55]. Integrating EBITDA into EVM allows project managers to plan and control financial targets effectively. Based on this review, we establish the following hypotheses: In this section, we will delve into integrating EBITDA into EVM for project management, which addresses the third research question. Our focus will be on exploring the incorporation of EBITDA measures to maximize daily EBITDA within EVM, and we will pose two important questions: 1. Can integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and WBS enable active profitability management? 2. Can integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and WBS streamline operations and project management while increasing profitability? To address these inquiries, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of various EVM performance indicators and devised a strategy for integrating EBITDA into the current system. EBITDA is crucial as a performance metric not only to gauge performance but also to facilitate the formulation of improvement initiatives [54]. Performance indicators play a vital role in enabling companies to evaluate their systems’ adherence to standards and progress toward specific objectives [56]. Using key performance indicators such as EBITDA empowers managers to adeptly guide the company towards enhancement, make well-informed decisions, and incentivize and reward employees. With technological advancements, it is now feasible to collect data and analyze the most pertinent variables in real time to assess key performance indicators [51]. Fig 4 depicts the S-Curve EVM project management from the project owner’s viewpoint, wherein PV represents the Planned Value equivalent to the Planned Costs. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g004 The Budget Actual Costs (BAC) represent the accumulated planned expenses for a project. The Earned Value (EV) is subtracted from the Actual Costs (AC) to calculate the cost variance. Meanwhile, the Schedule Variance (SV) compares the Earned Value (EV) and Planned Value (PV) against the project baseline and work schedule. It’s worth noting that EVM relies on monetary values instead of schedule indicators, which some professionals may find unreliable [32, 57]. This study focuses on examining the financial metrics utilized to manage project management profitability. However, the current version of the Earned Value Management (EVM) framework lacks complete oversight over production and revenue. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an additional baseline to ensure better control over these aspects [26]. EBITDA and EVM can be integrated into project management for a positive outcome. The project manager can use EBITDA as a buffer to manage actual costs effectively. Based on Fig 5, the EBITDA figure is positive, which suggests that the revenue surpasses the costs incurred (EV-AC). In project management, cost variance is the difference between planned and actual costs, denoted as CV (PM) = planned costs—AC. Moreover, schedule variance (SV) is the difference between the work performed and the scheduled planned value (SV = EV—PV). We must integrate these metrics into each WBS and work package to include EBITDA and EBITDA Margin in the EVM. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g005 Numerous companies encounter difficulties when implementing budgets [58]. The literature emphasizes that performance measurement is essential for effectively managing production systems [56]. Inaccurate data can hinder companies in assessing profitability and recognizing areas for improvement [54]. Financial indicators like EBITDA are important for demonstrating the process’s financial performance to management. Developing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as EBITDA would enable stakeholders to have visibility into the process’s real-time performance [59]. Monitoring real-time product costs is crucial for promptly identifying any unexpected increases that could erode the EBITDA margin [51]. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) serves as a framework for outlining the project budget [30, 60, 61]. EBITDA can be assigned to each WBS and Work Package using a top-down approach, establishing target EBITDA and refining these allocations based on bottom-up input. By combining bottom-up and top-down approaches, governance challenges can be addressed effectively, and learning within the project management process can be promoted. The allocation of EBITDA to every WBS provides a profitability indicator for each business process. Companies can apply Business Process Reengineering (BPR) to reduce activity costs by analyzing and redesigning WBS workflows and processes [62]. Therefore, integrating EBITDA into the WBS facilitates the implementation of BPR in project management, ultimately strengthening profitability. In addition to the result of the study in section 2.4 we will further study to addresses the third research question RQ3. How can a company use integrated EVM-I/S to increase PM profitability and maximize PM daily EBITDA? To maximize daily EBITDA, project managers need to focus on improving cost efficiency, productivity, quality, delivery, and safety [13, 63, 64]. The first step is to provide structured indicators to assess whether a production system efficiently uses its resources [56]. Maximizing daily EBITDA involves conducting daily simulations [65], setting high expectations, utilizing objective data, and providing timely feedback on performance [66]. Strategies like Business Process (BP) methods [11], and the Project Value Risk Opportunity (PVRO) framework can help achieve high-performance positions and optimize decision-making [4, 67, 68]. Companies can maximize EBITDA by elevating the constraint through lean methods in business process management, which involves identifying customer value and addressing wastage to resolve bottlenecks. Companies can maximize EBITDA by elevating the constraint by increasing their capacity with extra resources [69]. Addressing wastage can resolve bottlenecks in the process, leading to improvements [59]. The superficial differences in Business Processes improvement may significantly impact project success [62]. In summary, we define the following hypotheses: This section answers the fourth research question: What benefits does using EBITDA to measure PM profitability offer? Through a literature review, we identified the limitations of EVM implementation [6], and how integrating EBITDA can mitigate these issues: It is crucial to integrate EBITDA into each Work Breakdown Structure as it enables a company to establish an internal control system for guiding resource allocation decisions based on WBS EBITDA or EBITDA Margin. These internal control systems are essential for managing companies with multi-operation production systems, particularly in the context of organizations overseeing multiple manufacturing facilities. The introduction of divisional and departmental budgets plays a key role in overseeing daily operations and comparing production and costs across different divisions and departments [65]. Integrating EBITDA into WBS, the company can differentiate the critical and non-critical activities in Project management. Project managers are required to work closely with other departments to effectively manage EBITDA and meet EBITDA targets. Coordination involves integrating a series of interdependent tasks that are essential for organizational productivity and efficiency [70–72]. Cooperation is vital for the successful implementation of complex strategies, relying on coordinated efforts and information sharing [71, 73]. Therefore, integrating EBITDA into EVM will allow for better visualization of the interdependency among activities. Achieving target EBITDA requires improved cooperation, coordination, and interdependency among activities. Maximizing daily EBITDA hinges on improving behavior and engagement. Engagement refers to involvement, commitment, and the willingness to overcome obstacles or constraints in strategy execution, ultimately challenging these constraints and delivering better performance [70, 74–76]. Therefore, integration of EBITDA into WBS will simplify manager to manage profitability. Ensuring maximum daily EBITDA across all work breakdown structures and work packages requires effective communication. Precise and efficient communication is vital for sharing strategic information and facilitating successful implementation [72, 75, 77]. Thus, integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and work breakdown structures will provide project managers with the necessary information. Therefore, integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and work breakdown structures will enable the project manager’s ability to get the information needed. The above findings reveal that integrating EBITDA as a business process target and WBS enables project managers to improve daily profitability. The integration simplifies the project managers’ ability to demonstrate daily profitability (to avoid information asymmetry). In addition, the integration enables support project manager in achieving successful strategy and PM Target. Based on our findings, we formulated the following hypothesis: Building on the previous findings, we are now addressing research question 5: How can a company optimize its support for strategic PM decisions using EBITDA? Evaluating project success is challenging, as different stakeholders have varying definitions of success. To address this, it’s important to consider the perspectives of the owner, contractor, end user, and the public. While measuring management performance is crucial, financial results often lag behind decision-making, posing challenges for taking timely action [55]. To prevent delays in accessing profitability information, it is recommended to monitor daily EBITDA. By sharing profitability information and displaying planned and actual daily EBITDA, the company can promote transparency and enhance its capabilities in this area. This approach fosters effective communication, supports knowledge management, and reinforces the significance of project management [17, 20, 78]. The equitable distribution of information has a positive impact on both individual and organizational performance. Effective communication by project managers significantly enhances the performance of project teams, as managers dedicate considerable time to communicating with team members and key stakeholders [79]. Sharing information can facilitate manufacturing decisions while visualizing and communicating efficiency and productivity can assist in setting goals and driving performance improvement [80]. The use of EBITDA indicator in every WBS enables PM to indicate deviations and streamline our business processes. This method helps us visualize and evaluate capacity across all processes, synchronize operational capacity, and identify bottlenecks [81, 82]. It is essential to communicate clearly and effectively when sharing information about EBITDA results, including the target, strategy, and implementation. This clear communication is crucial for ensuring that everyone understands the information and can successfully execute the strategy [70, 72, 77]. By summarizing this discussion and those in the previous subsections, we developed the following hypotheses: comprehension of the concept after eleven months of research in the longitudinal time frame. From the above study, we can summarize that integrating EVM—Income Statements -WBS—EBITDA can broaden the application of EVM in management and business fields. Further, we will provide a summary table to ease the test of the hypotheses in the next Section. To answer RQ1, we summarize the finding from previous study and hypothesis in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t001 Table 1 provides an overview of the research questions, corresponding hypotheses, planned data collection, and analysis for Batch #1 and #2. The second round of data collection and analysis will be carried out to assess the comprehension of the concept after eleven months of research in the longitudinal time frame. In reference to the study discussed in Section 2, it was concluded that incorporating earned value management (EVM) into income statements has the potential to improve project management profitability and increase its significance in the business and management fields. This research is a step towards wider acceptance of EVM in these domains. Furthermore, we will delve into the hypotheses in the upcoming section. The authors have confirmed that this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board (ethics committee) of the Bandung Institute of Technology prior to commencement. The original approval document was obtained from our academic institution’s ethics committee. The author and the author’s institution have obtained permission from the companies to conduct research for academic purposes and have been authorized to produce academic literature. The ethics statement document includes the written permit (approval) for research within the companies. The researcher/interviewer conducted the study without any prior relationship with the participants. Regarding participant consent, the author and the companies informed the participants that the study was purely for academic purposes. The research participants are company officials and management; no minors were included. The authors commenced research in Shipbuilding on May 15, 2023, and concluded it on July 12, 2024. Additionally, they initiated research in Aircraft Manufacturing on May 22, 2023, and completed it on July 19, 2024. To explore the connection between EVM and profitability, we conducted a comprehensive literature review using Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Publish or Perish with the keyword "Earned Value Management." Initially, our search resulted in over 1000 articles. We then refined our search by adding the keyword "profit" and setting the publication date from 2014 onwards, which narrowed the relevant articles to 108. Using NVivo, we meticulously analyzed these articles to identify word frequencies. Our analysis revealed that "project = 15.754," "earned = 3.226," "EVM = 3.390," and "costs = 1.068" were frequently mentioned, while "revenue = 66," "profit = 300," and "profitability = 53" appeared less often. Overlooking these critical aspects could lead to information imbalances and conflicts among stakeholders, underscoring the necessity of integrating profitability into EVM for effective project management [78]. The table of this findings is available in S1 Appendix. Later in this chapter, our research indicates that EBITDA is the optimal profitability frontier for project management [67] and can serve as a suitable indicator for PM. By integrating EBITDA into EVM methodology, we can maximize daily EBITDA in every business process, WBS, and work package to enhance PM performance and profitability. Our research aims to create practical solutions through a pragmatic philosophy. Our methodology combined deduction and induction, and we developed a protocol to guide our research process [83]. We collected qualitative data through interviews and observation, while quantitative data was collected through online surveys. We employed a Multiple Embedded Case Study design. The selection was imperative to examine project complexity factors from an unbiased and comprehensive perspective [84]. Our analysis involved using SPSS for statistical analysis and NVivo for qualitative analysis. The Case Study Protocol and Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research Checklist are available in S2 and S3 Appendices [83, 85]. The corresponding author conducted the interview or focus group. The author has 25 years of experience as a management consultant and is considered an expert in turnaround strategies. The participants know the interviewer as the company’s Turnaround Expert. The interviewers’ genuine interest in the research topic and enthusiasm about conducting a case study that combines long-term practical experience with theory is evident. The study focused on understanding profitability information asymmetry in Project Management using EVM systems. They are eager to share knowledge with academic and practical communities. The authors of this study delved into relevant theories and conducted surveys to comprehensively explore the effects of information asymmetry on profitability in Project Management, specifically through the use of EVM systems. They found that this information imbalance could potentially lead to conflicts between management and stakeholders. To gain a deeper understanding, the study employed both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis, utilizing multiple embedded case studies and surveys. The research focused on Shipbuilding and Aircraft Manufacturing Companies that integrated EVM with Income Statements and EBITDA into their Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to improve Project Management Performance and Profitability. Specifically, the study included two project-based organizations in the defense industry. The authors conducted detailed case studies on two companies that integrated EVM with Income Statements and EBITDA into their WBS. The first company, a prominent shipbuilding company, managed 25 projects, including warships and submarines, while the second company, an aircraft manufacturing company, oversaw 20 projects, including helicopters and rockets. The study included the collection of both qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative research methods, such as interviews and purposive sampling, were utilized. Invitations were extended to 30 individuals from Shipbuilding and Aircraft Manufacturing Companies, and 20 participants from various levels within the organizations were selected to take part. Regrettably, ten individuals were unable to participate due to time and scheduling constraints. Additional qualitative data was gathered through observations at aircraft manufacturing and shipbuilding companies, as well as through meeting minutes from the corporate office. The research purpose was to communicate to the interviewees through various means, including face-to-face interviews, emails, WhatsApp messages, and phone calls. The company’s Board of Directors and employees were involved in the survey and interviews. The researcher obtained qualitative data from the corporate office through observations, interviews, and meeting minutes. During the interviews, only the interviewer and the interviewees were present. However, during observations and group discussions, non-participants who were company employees not assigned to the project were in the room. The researchers provided a question guide and survey questionnaires for the structured interviews. For the unstructured interviews, the interviewees freely expressed their opinions about the program. Repeat interviews with the same person were not conducted. Structured interviews involved asking the same standardized questions to different interviewees. Before recording, the author informed the interviewees that the interview would be recorded and obtained their consent. During the interviews, the author used audio-visual recording via Zoom to gather data, enabling the taking of meeting minutes during the session. Interviews and discussions typically lasted 30–60 minutes, and participants received transcripts for review. For Interviews, we sent thirty invitations to two companies, ten people unable to participate due to time and schedule constraints. As shown in Table 2, the author held two sessions of interviews with 20 volunteers representing various positions, including board members, senior executives, managers, project managers, and professionals from the PM team. The interview participants are as follows: one COO (Male, master’s degree); one CFO (Male, master’s degree); one EVP (Male, a master’s degree); nine V.P. (1 Male with a Doctorate, 1 Female with a master’s degree, 4 Males with a master’s degree, 3 Males with a bachelor’s degree); and eight Managers (1 Male with a master’s degree, 3 Females with bachelor’s degrees, 4 Males with bachelor’s degrees). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t002 The first session consisted of structured interviews with predetermined questions. We distributed research protocols before the questionnaires to ensure the validity and reliability of our study [83, 84]. In the second session, we conducted unstructured interviews to delve deeper into participants’ understanding of integrating EBITDA with EVM and its usefulness in project management for their company. We specifically focused on the benefits of measuring PM EBITDA for project managers and stakeholders [78]. We used a longitudinal time horizon to understand the development of business processes and cultural improvement over time, which is valuable for researchers and project managers [2]. The researcher identified the themes in advance, but the author did not discuss data saturation in this qualitative research. The author used NVivo software to analyze the qualitative data from the interviews. During the project/program briefing, the participants were provided feedback on the findings. In addition, we combined the case study with the survey method to create a comprehensive mixed-methods research design [83]. The author collected data from two separate participant batches from shipbuilding and aircraft manufacturing companies for quantitative data. We conducted our survey in two batches, with 220 volunteer participants (104 Shipbuilding participants, and 116 Aircraft Manufacturing Participants) surveyed over six months to test Hypotheses. As shown in Table 3, during the second batch, we involved 125 volunteer participants (from both companies) over 11 months to test hypotheses A, B, C, and D. Our empirical data was collected using questionnaires scored on 7-point Likert scales and was quantitatively analyzed using SPSS. The researcher used the participants’ quotations to explain the findings from the interview results. The participants conveyed their perspectives using standard daily language, adding depth and authenticity to the research. This use of daily language made the findings more transparent and more relatable by showcasing how they were grounded in the participants’ actual words. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t003 Referring to section 2.1.3, Fig 2 shows the integration of the income statement’s structure, EVM, and its relationship with management control. Our research findings from section 2 indicate that companies can integrate EVM into overall business management by aligning it with income statement metrics. We propose expanding the use of EVM beyond project management. Project managers can incorporate EBITDA into every WBS to facilitate the direct translation of EVM indicators into financial reporting language and establish a relevant profitability metric for project management. To validate these conclusions, we comprehensively analyzed quantitative and qualitative data to address all remaining research questions. In our initial data collection, we analyzed 220 questionnaires using IBM-SPSS to examine the use of EBITDA in project management profitability. We also investigated how a company can maximize daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system and the benefits of using EBITDA to measure project management profitability. This analysis used the following abbreviations: AMC means aircraft manufacturing corporation and SBC means shipbuilding corporation. Supporting Information for the First Batch of data analysis is available in S4 Appendix. Proportion Testing Hypothesis Research Question 2: Is EBITDA the proper measure for project management profitability? Hypothesis 1.A: EBITDA is the proper measure of Project Management Profitability because it excludes Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization, which do not vary due to Project Management efficiency and productivity variation. Hypothesis 1. B: EBITDA is the proper measure of project management profitability because it is entirely under the control of the project manager and team. Research Question 3: How can a company maximize daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system? The Company can maximize daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system by integrating EBITDA with EVM and applying target EBITDA margins in every work breakdown structure and work package. Hypothesis 2.A: The Company can maximize EBITDA with EVM in Project Management by integrating EBITDA to WBS and applying target EBITDA margin in every work breakdown structure and work package. Research Question 4: What are the benefits of using EBITDA to measure project management profitability? Hypotheses 3.A: Using EBITDA as a measure of Project Management Profitability allows Project Managers and Teams to manage and maximize Project Management Profitability actively. Hypothesis 3.B Applying EBITDA to EVM and WBS enables companies to display and control Project Management Profitability daily Research Question 5 How can a company improve its ability to support and make strategic decisions for Project Management using EBITDA? Hypotheses 4.A: The Company can improve its ability to support Project management by sharing the daily Target and Actual EBITDA result with its supporting Units. Hypothesis 4.B: The Company can improve its ability to support Project management by sharing the daily Target and Actual EBITDA with the Board of Directors to provide timely strategic decisions to Project management Chi square Testing This analysis technique belongs to non-parametric statistics, which is a branch of statistics that does not rely on the assumption of a particular distribution of the data. It is often used when the data does not meet the assumption of normality or when the sample size is small. This method is more flexible and can be applied to ordinal data or data that is not measured at intervals. Hypothesis H01: π ≤ 0.70 Ha1: π > 0.70 The test statistics used in the population proportion test Chi square test , the proportion of people who answered 6 or 7 to the question, and po = 0.70. The decision-making rule was to reject Ho if χ2>χ2 table with α = 0.05 Table 4 displays the Hypothesis Testing Results. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t004 The First Batch Hypothesis testing results are shown in Table 4. 1. While testing hypothesis 1.A, both AMC and SBC agree that EBITDA is a suitable measure of Project Management Profitability. 2. In evaluating hypothesis 1.B, there is a divergence of opinions between AMC and SBC regarding the control of EBITDA Project Management, with SBC disagreeing with the statement (χ2- value < 3.481 and p-value>0.05). 3. When testing hypothesis 2.A, there are differing opinions on whether integrating EBITDA to WBS and applying the target EBITDA Margin in WBS and Work Package can maximize EBITDA in EVM. Less than 70% of SBC respondents disagreed with the statement (χ2- value < 3.481 and p value> 0.05). 4. Hypothesis 3.A. testing indicates that using EBITDA as a measure of Project Management Profitability allows for active management and maximization of profitability, with approval from most AMC and SBC respondents (more than 70%, with χ2- value > 3.481 and -value < 0.05). 5. Hypothesis 3.B testing reveals a key insight: applying EBITDA to EVM and WBS empowers companies to display and control Project Management Profitability daily. While SBC respondents may have disagreed (χ2- value < 3.481 and p-value >0.05), the practical implications of this finding are significant, providing a clear path to enhanced profitability management. 6. In testing hypotheses 4.A and 4.B, a unanimous approval was received from all AMC and SBC respondents. This finding underscores the Company’s potential to enhance its ability to support Project management by sharing daily Targets and Actual EBITDA results with the Company’s supporting Units and the Board of Directors, instilling confidence in the proposed strategies. After implementing Maximizing Daily EBITDA in Aircraft Manufacturing and Shipbuilding Companies for eleven months, we conducted the second round of data collection. We gathered responses from 125 questionnaires without differentiating between aircraft manufacturing and shipbuilding companies. We tested several EBITDA and operational profitability hypotheses using a test statistic, χ2. The results of the testing are summarized below. Supporting Information for the Second Batch of data analysis is available in S5 Appendix. Our commitment to a comprehensive analysis led us to conduct proportion testing on the data, testing a multitude of hypotheses. This rigorous process is a testament to our dedication to providing the most accurate and insightful findings. H01) π ≤ 0.70 and Ha1) π > 0.70. The test statistic used is Chi square test , the proportion of people who answered 6 or 7 to the question, and po = 0.70. The decision-making rule was to reject Ho if χ2>χ2 table with α = 0.05 The results are summarized in Table 5 below. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t005 Proportion Testing Hypothesis H01: π ≤ 0.70 Ha1: π > 0.70 The test statistics used in Chi square test are , x is people who answered 6 or 7 on the question E = n.po and po = 0.70 decision making: Reject Ho if p-value < α (= 0.05) Sumary sub section 4.1.2: Table 6 displays the Hypothesis Testing Results https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t006 All proportions who answered 6 and 7 were greater than 0.70 (70%) with a small standard error. Standard Error measures the precision of estimates/estimates of population parameters, reflecting the accuracy of the values calculated from the sample against the population. A small standard error means that the sample mean/mean spread is also small, so the estimate of the population parameter is accurate. The qualitative analysis conducted with NVivo showcases the findings from structured interviews. The comprehensive results obtained from NVivo encompasses both structured and unstructured interviews. After completing a comprehensive qualitative data analysis, it has become evident that EBITDA is the most suitable operating profit indicator for the EVM system in Project Management. Integrating EBITDA into EVM involves establishing the budget’s EBITDA value to determine plan costs and applying the EBITDA margin in every work breakdown structure and work package. By using EBITDA to evaluate project management profitability, the company can empower the project manager and team to understand the target EBITDA and maximize profitability. Sharing EBITDA can also enhance support and facilitate timely strategic decisions for Project Management. The qualitative analysis conducted with NVivo, as depicted in Table 4, showcases the findings from structured interviews. The comprehensive results obtained from NVivo encompass both structured and unstructured interviews. Discussion of qualitative analysis with NVivo Table 7 and Fig A-3 until A-6 in S1 Appendix display the results of the qualitative analysis using structured interviews by NVivo. Supporting Information of the interview is available in S6 Appendix. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t007 Referring to the Quantitative and Qualitative data results, we found that some employees needed to be aware of the importance of EBITDA for Project Management during the early assessment. Regarding H2, less than 70% of the SBC respondents agreed that EBITDA project management is entirely under the control of the project manager and the team. This response is because some operational and project management personnel remained unaware of the EBITDA concept. Many of them were not concerned with controlling EBITDA. The Interview with the chief financial and human capital officer (Interviewee O) confirmed this result. Regarding H3, less than 70% of SBC respondents agreed that a company can maximize EBITDA in EVM by integrating EBITDA into WBS and applying the target EBITDA margin in WBS and the Work Package. This response is because some people in the SBC did not have experience implementing the EBITDA–EVM integration. The SBC was in the early stage of implementing EBITDA–EVM integration using its information technology system, the ITS. The senior vice president of corporate transformation (Interviewee D) confirmed this explanation in the Interview. Regarding H5, less than 70% of the SBC respondents agreed that applying EBITDA to EVM and WBS enables companies to display and control project management profitability daily. This response is because some SBC employees need experience managing daily Profitability. However, the management expected the situation to change because the Company has begun implementing daily control and maximizing daily EBITDA in the EVM system, supported by their information system, ITS. The vice president of human capital (Interviewee M) confirmed this explanation and explained the Company’s policy to control employees’ daily activities using handphone devices provided by the Company. After eleven months of maximizing daily EBITDA in the EVM system project management, we found significant improvement in understanding the concept from the survey of both companies. Regarding the first research question, we found that the respondents agree that EBITDA is appropriate for project management profitability. Fig 2 displays the integration of EVM into the Income Statement using seven earnings steps. Fig 3 shows EBITDA under the control of Operation Management and Project Management. On the other hand, Depreciation, Amortization, Interest, and Tax are not under the control of Operation Management but of the Board of Directors. Regarding the second research question, we found that respondents agree that the Company can maximize daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system by Integrating EBITDA as a target in Business Processes and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). Regarding the third Research Question, we found that the respondents agree that the Company can get the benefits of using EBITDA to measure project management profitability from Integrating EBITDA as a target in Business Processes and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) that will ease Operational Management and Project Management to display their Profitability every day. Regarding the fourth research question, we found that respondents agree that the Company improved its ability to support and make strategic decisions for project management using EBITDA from the availability of daily EBITDA information for divisions and company operational units, as well as project management to provide support for achieving successful strategy and project management. All proportions who answered 6 and 7 were more significant than 0.70 (70%) with a relatively small standard error. Standard Error measures the precision of estimates/estimates of population parameters, reflecting the accuracy of the values ​​calculated from the sample against the population. A small standard error means that the sample mean/mean spread is also small, so the estimate of the population parameter is accurate. Based on our assessment, some employees need to understand the significance of EBITDA for project management. Less than 70% of the SBC respondents initially agreed to incorporate EBITDA into WBS and apply the target EBITDA margin in WBS and the Work Package to optimize EVM. The SBC is still in the early stages of integrating EBITDA and EVM using its information technology system, the ITS. Significant improvements were observed after nearly a year of focusing on integrating EVM into income statements and maximizing daily EBITDA in the EVM system project management. The respondents concur that EBITDA is the appropriate measure for project management profitability. The consensus among respondents was that the company could enhance daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system by integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and work breakdown structures (WBS). Concerning management practices, when proposing a program like integrating EVM into an income statement in project management, managers consider the expected costs of adoption against the expected benefits. The new system’s speed and ease of adoption will depend on corporate and national cultures [86]. It is strategically advantageous to incorporate EBITDA into every Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Work Package. This integration allows the management team to effectively oversee job assignments. When combined with Earned Value Management (EVM), this approach can significantly enhance profitability by improving efficiency and productivity. The integration of EVM into income statements and EBITDA into WBS aligns project management and financial systems. This common language enables leaders to cultivate a robust corporate culture, enhance efficiency, and improve productivity for superior performance and profitability. By comparing EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and their respective trends before and during project management execution, organizations can make informed decisions about resource allocation priorities in each WBS Project portfolio. Despite the importance and widespread nature of projects, there is currently little space devoted to project management research in leading business and management journals. We need more research for systemic approaches to projects, situating them in broader organizational landscapes. Addressing grand challenges involves changing project management practices to create and distribute value among diverse stakeholders [3]. The principles of Earned Value Management (EVM) and Project Management theory are accessible to all project management professionals and can be applied across various business and management domains. It is hoped that professionals in fields other than project management will adopt these concepts. This study demonstrates that incorporating EVM into income statements can enhance project management profitability, reduce information asymmetry, and garner support from stakeholders for making strategic decisions to ensure project management success. Specifically, this integration allows project managers to optimize Daily EBITDA within each Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and achieve improved performance and profitability. Integrating EVM into the income statement was challenging and required a shift in organizational culture. However, after eleven months of focusing on maximizing daily EBITDA within the EVM system, there was a notable improvement in understanding the concept based on the survey responses from participating companies. The study also highlights that EBITDA is a suitable metric for assessing project management profitability, as it is within the control of Operations Management and Project Management. Conversely, factors such as depreciation, amortization, interest, and taxes fall under the purview of the board of directors rather than operations management. Furthermore, by incorporating EBITDA as a target within each WBS, companies can effectively maximize daily EBITDA in project management within the EVM system, providing a clear view of profitability daily. This integration will facilitate communication between project management professionals and business management and foster greater acceptance of project management concepts within the business and management fields. Hopefully, this will also encourage dialogue between project management scholars and those in related disciplines, particularly business and management. The integration of EVM into income statements and EBITDA into WBS not only combines the project management and financial systems but also integrates the language of both fields, enabling leaders to foster a strong corporate culture, improve efficiency, and enhance productivity for better performance and profitability. The Organization can improve its decision-making regarding resource allocation priorities in each WBS Project portfolio by conducting a thorough comparison of EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and their respective trends both before and during project management execution. This study provides valuable insights and evidence-based ideas about project management and can potentially enhance its use in the business and management sectors. The author’s unique contribution lies in integrating EVM into the income statement with EBITDA into WBS. This research ensures we can apply the theoretical concepts effectively in practical settings with broader implications. The implications of Earned Value Management (EVM) and Project Management theory are understandable to any project management professional and can be applied across various business and management sectors. It is hoped that professionals in fields beyond project management will embrace these concepts. These topics warrant further in-depth exploration in future research. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s004 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s005 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s006 (DOCX)

Title: Is AI A Boom, Bubble, Or Con? Here’s What The Evidence Suggests
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrau/2025/01/03/is-ai-a-boom-bubble-or-con-heres-what-the-evidence-suggests/
Time Published: 2025-01-03T13:46:21Z
Full Content:
Robot and young woman face to face. Everyone knows that the stock market’s super-run in recent years has revolved around seven core stocks: The “Magnificent Seven” of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla (in alphabetical order). Most of the seven, if not all, are assumed to be the beneficiaries of the stupendous growth of artificial intelligence. The “Magnificent Seven” have a combined market value of more than $17 trillion, and accounted for over half of the S&P 500’s total return in 2024. Over the last five years, all seven have seen annualized appreciation rates of 20 percent or more, with Tesla hitting 73 percent and Nvidia exceeding 90 percent. Is this sustainable? How does it all end? And what does it say about the AI boom that plays a pivotal role in the seven’s success? Two years ago, I published a Forbes column about Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX, and the bitcoin mania. Back then, the price of a single bitcoin hovered around $20,000, while it hovers around $100,000 today. Then, like now, a key question was being asked: Is bitcoin a boom, a bubble, or a “con”? The Wall Street Journal’s Vicky Ge Huang recently compiled the warnings that some of the world’s great investors gave the public about cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and yet the $100,000 valuation suggests we’re not listening. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin a useless “pet rock,” while Citadel CEO Ken Griffin wonders aloud, “What problem does it solve for our economy?” But what about AI? Is artificial intelligence something that the truly sophisticated suspect to be another bubble, and we’re ignoring that risk? Or is AI an actual boom, and the question is how and when the “landing” comes? My conclusion is the latter. AI is a real investment in something that even less experienced investors can understand where big-league returns may arise. From medical applications to breakthroughs in content creation or computer science, AI is already revolutionizing the world of work, and there’s no reason for the innovation to stop now. And yet, will the returns be big enough or likely enough to warrant the kind of investment it now takes to “get in the game”? That’s where I get more skeptical. There is a long list of things that have to go right for the value creation of the magnitude assumed by today’s AI pricings to materialize: One thing is clear: AI is a very real and transformative technology, but scale will be integral to addressing such problems. The market will only want—and can only afford—four or five surviving players. As product competition leads to commoditization, competitive pricing and the ability to “stay current” will be the keys to survival. As always, a select few investors will make enormous sums of money either by riding the wave and getting out of the water in time, or picking one of the ultimate survivors and hanging on for the ride. Countless start-ups and venture capital firms will see 100 percent losses as they stall out on scale or fall outside the cone of competitive capability. However, all of the evidence suggests AI is neither a bubble nor a con; it is a boom with lasting potential. While there is plenty of irrational exuberance related to AI, that is the free market’s way of experimenting and learning, which have always given the U.S. economy its edge. AI’s biggest winners will have solutions that address real problems and create new forms of competitive advantage, and we should be ready for those benefits to materialize in the coming years. On the other hand, hindsight will become 20-20 for the losers who assumed it was a “sure thing.” When only a few numbers will come up winners, I don’t see anyone winning by placing bets across the board. AI will be a long-term winner for a select—and potentially magnificent—few who successfully sell their wares with scale to customers who happily pay for the cost and productivity gains they will create.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Long-Term Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) stands against the other best long-term penny stocks to buy. On December 3rd, Bob Kaynor, CFA, Head of US Small & Midcap Equities at Schroders, provided a comprehensive outlook for small-cap stocks in 2025, emphasizing their potential as a cost-effective investment in the robust US economy. He mentioned that the economy has shown resilience post-pandemic, bolstered by fiscal stimulus from the Biden Administration through significant legislation like the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This recovery is primarily driven by strong consumer spending and a favorable labor market. In this robust environment while large-cap equities may appear expensive and have likely priced in much of the anticipated growth, small and mid-cap stocks remain relatively undervalued. This presents an opportunity for investors to gain exposure to domestic economic strength without incurring high costs. Kaynor identified several trends, which he believes could enhance the performance of small and mid-cap stocks in 2025. He pointed out that following a downturn in 2022 and 2023 due to recession fears and high valuations, M&A activity is now rebounding. This resurgence is expected to benefit small-cap stocks as they often become acquisition targets. Additionally, increased IPO activity can generate interest and optimism in the small-cap sector. Moreover, the ongoing and anticipated decline in interest rates starting late 2024 is expected to reduce borrowing costs for small-cap companies, which typically rely on short-term financing. This environment is historically favorable for small caps, particularly when inflation stabilizes between 1% and 3%. Kaynor also noted that the service sector of the market is expanding. The services sector not only forms a significant portion of the GDP but also favors small-cap companies primarily those operating within this space. Moreover, trends like reshoring are enabling small firms to become reliable suppliers for larger corporations. He expects that increased CapEx driven by automation and government support in sectors like semiconductors will likely correlate with revenue growth for small caps, further enhancing their investment appeal next year. Kaynor noted that Wall Street analysts predict a substantial rebound in earnings for small caps beginning in late 2024, with expectations that their growth will outpace large caps throughout most of 2025.

To curate the list of the 12 best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener we got an initial list of penny stocks (trading under $5) with more than 20% 5-year sales growth. Next, we cross-checked each stock for 5-year sales growth from Seeking Alpha. Lastly, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders sourced from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 hedge funds database. Please note that the stock prices were recorded on December 31, 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stock Price: $3.72 5-Year Sales Growth: 34.42% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13 SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) is an insurance and healthcare services company. The company uses technology to connect consumers directly with insurance products, allowing them to compare options from multiple providers easily.

This approach is critical as SelectQuote aims to optimize cash flow and improve its balance sheet. Moreover, it is also leveraging AI tools to enhance operational efficiency by screening and prioritizing calls, thus simplifying processes behind the scenes. These effective marketing strategies resulted in a 26% year-over-year increase in revenue, totaling $292.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, up from $232.7 million in the same period last year. In addition to revenue, the company also improved its adjusted EBITDA by reducing the loss by nearly $10 million, from negative $11.4 million last year to negative $1.7 million during the current fiscal year. On the bright side, its healthcare segment saw membership grow by 64%, reaching over 86,000 members. This segment has now recorded six consecutive quarters of profitability, demonstrating strong operational execution. Management anticipates continued success driven by its strategic initiatives in both Senior distribution and Healthcare Services. Overall, SLQT ranks 7th on our list of best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of SLQT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) on The Net Worth Club’s Substack by Danny Brody. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on TTWO. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO)'s share was trading at $183.07 as of Jan 2nd. TTWO’s forward P/E was 23.87 according to Yahoo Finance. A computer technician working on a video game console with a gaming headset. Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO), the company behind hit franchises like Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, and NBA 2K, is positioning itself as a prime player in the gaming industry despite facing a recent net loss of $1.125 billion, largely attributed to write-downs and impairment charges. For fiscal 2024, Take-Two reported $5.35 billion in revenue, placing it among the industry's elite. While its profitability has been affected by one-time events, the recurring revenue from its core franchises offers a strong foundation for future growth. This resilience and the potential for a turnaround make TTWO an appealing investment, especially for those looking beyond short-term setbacks. The gaming industry is experiencing significant consolidation, and TTWO stands out as an attractive acquisition target, especially as tech giants like Microsoft continue to strengthen their positions by acquiring major content providers. Amazon’s rumored interest in gaming via acquisition further underscores TTWO’s potential. With a market cap of $32 billion, Take-Two is still smaller than Activision Blizzard, which was acquired by Microsoft for $75 billion, making it an affordable target relative to its intrinsic value. Take-Two's shift toward recurring revenue models, such as subscription services, in-game purchases, and free-to-play models, aligns with broader industry trends. The upcoming release of highly anticipated titles like Borderlands 4, Mafia: The Old Country, and Grand Theft Auto 6 is expected to drive significant revenue growth. The release of GTA 6, following the success of GTA 5, could generate more than $10 billion in revenue for Take-Two, cementing its position as a leader in the gaming industry. If TTWO were valued similarly to Activision, applying an 8.5x revenue multiple would push its valuation to $45.5 billion, or about $256 per share—substantially higher than its current market price. With its strong intellectual property, expanding revenue models, and exciting pipeline, Take-Two is well-positioned for both short-term gains and long-term growth, making it an attractive investment opportunity in the evolving gaming landscape. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 46 hedge fund portfolios held TTWO at the end of the third quarter which was 48 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of TTWO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TTWO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The Morning After: FCC’s attempt to restore net neutrality didn't work

The Sixth Circuit US Court of Appeals ruled yesterday that the FCC does not have the "statutory authority" to implement net neutrality rules. Since the rules were established in 2015, the FCC argued that classifying ISPs as "telecommunication services" gives it broad authority to regulate them. The decision to redefine ISPs as "information services" during the first Trump Administration led to the repeal of net neutrality in 2017. The current FCC voted to restore net neutrality on April 25 last year. The difference between 2015 and now is the Supreme Court's recent, radical reinterpretation of an important legal doctrine. The Chevron doctrine said that if Congress doesn't weigh in on an issue, courts are supposed to defer to the interpretation of government agencies. Now, interpretation falls to the individual judge, and the Sixth Court doesn't agree with the FCC. This is the end of the road for the FCC’s attempts to wrench a little bit of the power from internet providers and carriers and level speeds and access regardless of service. Net neutrality rules will remain in California and other states, but anything at the federal level will require either an act of Congress or, for this case, be appealed to (and succeed in front of) the Supreme Court. – Mat Smith Get this delivered daily direct to your inbox.

East Village Bar in Douglas Long-standing Douglas pub East Village has said it is "time to say goodbye" after operating in the town for more than two decades. The bar is set to be transferred to new ownership and will close from Monday, January 6 to facilitate a "smooth transition" for the new owners. In a post shared on its social media, the bar said it will also be hosting a farewell party to celebrate the last 20 years in business. "All of us here at East Village would like to thank all of our wonderful customers and staff, friends and family, for joining us over the years," the social media post read. "There’s been many laughs and unforgettable memories the last 20 years but we are sad to announce it’s time to say goodbye. "We hope you can join us this Saturday for our farewell party and celebrate the East Village with us." The East Village's current owners are well-known publicans Jon Cronin and Derry O'Regan. Speaking to the Irish Examiner, Mr O'Regan said the business is being transferred to new owners who have "big plans" to renovate and relaunch.

Title: Secret Level asked Microsoft about an awesome Halo and Doom crossover — "Crafting this impassioned letter of my childhood," but Microsoft said: "Nah."

An interview with the creators of Secret Level revealed how crossover episode pitches to id Software and Microsoft fell flat. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. I still remember when I first heard about Xbox making a Halo TV show. I'm not reminiscing about when the Paramount TV show was announced, but when they first mentioned that Steven Spielberg would be directing it in 2013. An entire decade before. It was around the time of the Xbox One announcement and launch. The Halo TV show was part of the whole "all your entertainment in a single box" push. It was meant to usher in a new age at Microsoft, one that focused on programming and content for the customer. After years of hearing, "Don't worry, the Halo show is still coming," we were finally blinded by Master Cheeks. Halo fans around the globe held their gaming controllers, hoping for a cinematic Master Piece. What they received was a show that not only missed the spirit of the franchise but somehow failed to even make a decent sci-fi series.Once I heard the helmet was coming off, it was like I heard the sounds of distant Plasma Grenades echoing across the city. Lore was ignored or replaced, and we ended up with a weird romance being pitched between Master Chief and someone who wasn't Cortana. It's one of the easiest things to get right. I guess that's what made the following news all the more confusing to me. In an interview with Collider, Tim Miller and Dave Wilson, the men behind the new TV show Secret Level, revealed a few interesting tidbits that definitely caused some sore necks from the massive head turn we all did. For those unaware, Secret Level is an animated anthology series that covers the worlds of 15 different video games. Led in production by Blur Studios and Amazon MGM Studios, the series saw Pac-Man, Warhammer, Sifu, and more make the cut in the first season. It's what didn't show up that people found rather baffling. When asked whether the showrunners went after certain games, Tim Miller responded with, "I get a little chafed when I read online, and they're like, 'Hold on, these assholes took Spelunky when they could have taken Halo?' Or something like that. I'm like, 'Man, you think that we didn't talk to Halo or something?'" Dave Wilson continued later, "The creative director at ID [Software] is a good friend of ours, and so are folks at Microsoft, so we made a big plea because one of the things both Tim and I would love to do is do something that isn't currently available in the games, like crossovers. We wanted to make a Master Chief/Doom Slayer crossover episode, and I spent a whole weekend crafting this impassioned letter of my childhood. And it's exactly what Tim said; they were like, 'Nah.'" Excuse me? Microsoft said what? You had showrunners who were absolutely enthralled with the world of Halo and Doom and wanted to make something extraordinary, and you said no? Not to mention, with Blur Studios leading development, a studio that has already worked on multiple Halo games, you could have had the easiest Stick of your life. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Okay, I get it. You just released your Halo show you've been grinding to get done for almost a decade, and it bombed to the point of cancellation. Maybe you're a little Battle Rifle shy at the moment, but would it really have been any worse than what we got? Off the heels of the Halo TV show and layoffs at 343 Industries, Halo desperately needs a W. Even if a potential Halo and Doom crossover episode finds mixed reviews, it would already be infinitely better than what Paramount produced, but maybe that's the issue. Can Microsoft allow someone else to make a Halo TV show at the moment? After Paramounts failure, a successful spinoff like Secret Level could ruin the relationship between the two companies. While Halo failed, Microsoft has found success with Amazon and its award-winning take on Fallout. Netflix is also currently working on multiple Gears of War projects; there are plenty of IPs Microsoft has yet to explore. It's never a good idea to burn any bridges with a potential future partner on a project down the road. Even though Master Sheets didn't do so well with audiences, that doesn't mean Paramount is empty of video game-adapting talent. You only need to look at Sonic's success to see that (Don't look at the early trailers). Respect the source material, and it's pretty damn easy to find success. Gamers aren't a mystery. Had Microsoft said yes, maybe Paramount would have seen that as an action by Microsoft that admits the TV series they distributed was awful. It sounds silly, but I've seen companies halt production over sillier things before. Remember when Disney and Sony almost completely canceled the Spider-Man franchise that was worldly beloved? Had Microsoft said yes, maybe Paramount would have seen that as an action by Microsoft that admits the TV series they distributed was awful. It sounds silly, but I've seen companies halt production over more childish things before. Remember when Disney and Sony almost completely canceled the Spider-Man franchise, which was a box-office record-setter? At the end of the day, the fans of the series still deserve better. How freaking awesome would it be to see the Doom Slayer and Master Chief ripping apart flood-infested demons to save the human race? You could do it with minimal dialogue, too, where Chief calls out, "I need a weapon," and Doomguy tosses him a BFG with a nod. This writes itself, people! After slaying the demon race and protecting humanity once more, Chief reports back to base for a briefing, and Doomguy goes into cryo while stealing Chief's line, "Wake me when you need me." I didn't even realize how sad this whole thing was until I started writing this fanfic. Is it too late to petition Microsoft to say yes for the second season? At least the Halo Infinite storyline is pretty decent. What do you think? Let us know below or on social media. I'll be checking out the replies and conversing with anyone that wants to. If you're like me, you'll also daydream up some astonishing moments with cliche dialogue that seels the entire thing.

Frax intends to be the US digital dollar and to establish itself as "the world's most innovative decentralised stablecoin and DeFi stablecoin infrastructure." 1 03 January 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. Decentralised stablecoin cryptocurrency protocol Frax Finance has launched a new stablecoin, frxUSD, that will leverage BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), and will be tokenised by Securitize. Securitize will drive the compliant digitisation of financial assets through blockchain technology. Securitize, or through its subsidiaries, is also a registered broker-dealer and operates a primary marketplace, an alternative trading system, as well as a transfer agent and has an exempt reporting adviser. The frxUSD stablecoin, a rebrand of Frax's FRAX stablecoin, will offer direct fiat redemption capabilities and enhanced compliance with US financial systems. BUIDL will also become an enshrined custodian asset for minting and redeeming frxUSD. This means that the stablecoin will be uniquely backed by assets held in BlackRock's BUIDL, which invests in cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. This bolsters transparency and on-chain audibility, solidifying frxUSD as the first stablecoin to offer seamless fiat on/off-ramping capabilities via Blackrock's BUIDL infrastructure. Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, says: "Tokenized real-world assets provide an excellent bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance, bringing institutional-grade investments on-chain with unprecedented transparency and efficiency. This collaboration exemplifies the next stage in financial evolution, demonstrating how traditional and decentralized systems can work together to redefine asset management strategies. The integration of frxUSD and the BUIDL fund is a clear signal of the transformative potential of tokenization in modern finance." Sam Kazemian, founder of Frax Finance, adds: "By partnering with Securitize to access and leverage BlackRock's BUIDL Fund we are setting a new standard for stablecoins. frxUSD combines the transparency and programmability of blockchain technology with the trust and stability of BlackRock's prime treasury offerings. This collaboration is a significant step toward bridging traditional finance with decentralized systems."

Title: Nvidia Stock Vs. Custom AI Chips: Should Investors Worry?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/01/03/nvidia-stock-vs-custom-ai-chips-should-investors-worry/
Time Published: 2025-01-03T10:00:47Z

Signage with logo at the Silicon Valley headquarters of computer graphics hardware company Nvidia, ... [+] Santa Clara, California, August 17, 2017. (Photo via Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images). Nvidia stock had a stellar 2024, rising by almost 3x to about $135 per share. Business has boomed led by the surging demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) which have emerged as the backbone of the generative artificial intelligence era. That said, over the last month or so investors appear to have their eyes on another sector of the semiconductor market, namely ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that could play a bigger role in AI computing. This comes after two major ASIC players, Broadcom and Marvell Technology, reported a surge in demand for their ASICs from large cloud customers in the most recent quarters. Do Custom AI Chips Make Marvell Stock A Buy? For instance, Broadcom’s sales from its custom AI chips and networking processors surged by 220% to $12.2 billion in 2024, up from $3.8 billion in revenue that the company generated from AI silicon in FY’23. To be sure, Nvidia’s sales are head and shoulders above, estimated to come in at about $129 billion this fiscal year, but its growth rates are slowing. So could ASICs threaten Nvidia’s AI dominance as the market matures? Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. ASICS vs GPUs ASICs have been around for more than five decades. However, they are seeing renewed interest in the AI era. While GPUs from companies such as Nvidia are pretty versatile and can be programmed for AI as well as other tasks, ASICs are custom-designed semiconductors built to perform specific tasks giving them certain advantages versus general processors. By focusing on targeted functionalities these chips offer several advantages versus GPUs for AI. For instance, these specialized chips could be more cost-effective than GPUs, which are designed for a wider range of applications. ASICs also consume less electricity and this makes them ideal for data centers aiming to reduce electricity costs - a key cost of operating large AI systems. ASICs can also achieve higher performance for dedicated tasks than general-purpose GPUs from Nvidia or AMD as they are purpose-built. These chips could be well suited for large cloud computing providers given that they operate at a scale that can justify the design and development costs of ASICs. For instance, Broadcom, a company that is viewed as the biggest beneficiary of a potential pivot toward ASICs, recently said that three of its hyperscaler customers intend to build clusters of 1 million custom chips across a single network. Change In The AI Space Benefits ASICs Companies have devoted immense resources to building AI models over the last two years or so. Now training these massive models is more of a one-time affair that requires considerable computing power and Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of this, as its GPUs are regarded as the fastest and most efficient for these tasks. However, the AI landscape may be shifting. Incremental performance gains are expected to diminish as models grow larger in terms of several parameters. Separately, the availability of high-quality data for training models is likely to become a bottleneck as much of the Internet’s high-quality data is already run through large language models. Considering this, the significantly front-loaded AI training phase could wind down. The underlying economics of the end market for GPU chips and the broader AI ecosystem are weak, and most of Nvidia’s customers likely aren’t generating meaningful returns on their investments just yet. See How Nvidia Stock Could Fall To $65. As shareholders eventually seek better returns, we could see more customers looking toward ASICs to reduce upfront costs as well as operating costs. The longer-term focus of AI will be on inference, where trained models are used in real-world applications. This phase is less computationally intensive and could open the door for alternative AI processors that are less powerful.

Title: Nvidia Stock Vs. Custom AI Chips: Should Investors Worry?

Signage with logo at the Silicon Valley headquarters of computer graphics hardware company Nvidia, ... [+] Santa Clara, California, August 17, 2017. (Photo via Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images). Nvidia stock had a stellar 2024, rising by almost 3x to about $135 per share. Business has boomed led by the surging demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) which have emerged as the backbone of the generative artificial intelligence era. That said, over the last month or so investors appear to have their eyes on another sector of the semiconductor market, namely ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that could play a bigger role in AI computing. This comes after two major ASIC players, Broadcom and Marvell Technology, reported a surge in demand for their ASICs from large cloud customers in the most recent quarters. Do Custom AI Chips Make Marvell Stock A Buy? For instance, Broadcom’s sales from its custom AI chips and networking processors surged by 220% to $12.2 billion in 2024, up from $3.8 billion in revenue that the company generated from AI silicon in FY’23. To be sure, Nvidia’s sales are head and shoulders above, estimated to come in at about $129 billion this fiscal year, but its growth rates are slowing. So could ASICs threaten Nvidia’s AI dominance as the market matures? Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. ASICS vs GPUs ASICs have been around for more than five decades. However, they are seeing renewed interest in the AI era. While GPUs from companies such as Nvidia are pretty versatile and can be programmed for AI as well as other tasks, ASICs are custom-designed semiconductors built to perform specific tasks giving them certain advantages versus general processors. By focusing on targeted functionalities these chips offer several advantages versus GPUs for AI. For instance, these specialized chips could be more cost-effective than GPUs, which are designed for a wider range of applications. ASICs also consume less electricity and this makes them ideal for data centers aiming to reduce electricity costs - a key cost of operating large AI systems. ASICs can also achieve higher performance for dedicated tasks than general-purpose GPUs from Nvidia or AMD as they are purpose-built. These chips could be well suited for large cloud computing providers given that they operate at a scale that can justify the design and development costs of ASICs. For instance, Broadcom, a company that is viewed as the biggest beneficiary of a potential pivot toward ASICs, recently said that three of its hyperscaler customers intend to build clusters of 1 million custom chips across a single network. Change In The AI Space Benefits ASICs Companies have devoted immense resources to building AI models over the last two years or so. Now training these massive models is more of a one-time affair that requires considerable computing power and Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of this, as its GPUs are regarded as the fastest and most efficient for these tasks. However, the AI landscape may be shifting. Incremental performance gains are expected to diminish as models grow larger in terms of several parameters. Separately, the availability of high-quality data for training models is likely to become a bottleneck as much of the Internet’s high-quality data is already run through large language models. Considering this, the significantly front-loaded AI training phase could wind down. The underlying economics of the end market for GPU chips and the broader AI ecosystem are weak, and most of Nvidia’s customers likely aren’t generating meaningful returns on their investments just yet. See How Nvidia Stock Could Fall To $65. As shareholders eventually seek better returns, we could see more customers looking toward ASICs to reduce upfront costs as well as operating costs. The longer-term focus of AI will be on inference, where trained models are used in real-world applications. This phase is less computationally intensive and could open the door for alternative AI processors that are less powerful. ASIC chips customized for inference could also be a top choice for these tasks. There is some historical precedent to this as well. For example, in the the crypto industry, Bitcoin miners initially used GPUs for mining, but some large players have since switched to ASICs as they scaled up given their better hash rates (effectively how many guesses the system makes per second to solve the crypto puzzle) and overall cost-effectiveness.

Title: Happy Birthday, Bitcoin! The top cryptocurrency is old enough to drive
URL: https://qz.com/bitcoin-birthday-16-genesis-satoshi-nakamoto-1851731540
Time Published: 2025-01-03T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin is now 16 years old! Satoshi Nakamoto, a name used by the creator (or creators) of Bitcoin, mined the first Bitcoin block on Jan. 3, 2009. This “genesis” block followed the release of a Bitcoin whitepaper on October 31, 2008, which laid the foundation for the now-leading cryptocurrency. 2024 proved to be a landmark year for Bitcoin, culminating in an all-time high of $108,135 in December. Hypothetically, had someone invested $1,000 in Bitcoin on January 3, 2024, they would have witnessed a 115% growth in their investment, and seen it rise to $2,150. Over the past 16 years, Bitcoin has grown from a novel idea into a global phenomenon, shaping the cryptocurrency market and disrupting financial systems worldwide. From its humble beginnings in 2009, to its climb to $1 in 2011, and to its momentary rise above $100,000 in 2024, the journey so far reflects Bitcoin’s disruptive power. Let’s dive deeper into Bitcoin’s journey and see how it came to be a mainstream asset. Bitcoin rocketed in popularity after COVID-19 lockdowns. In 2021, it gained acceptance in mainstream finance with endorsements from influential figures. One of the pivotal moments was its inclusion in 401(k) plans, which marked a significant shift in how traditional retirement savings strategies embraced digital assets. After a prolonged bear market connected to the FTX collapse in 2022, Bitcoin made a strong comeback in 2024. Early on in the year, Bitcoin reached a high of $73,000 due to the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, followed by the U.K.’s approval of Bitcoin-linked securities being listed on the stock market. In a year alone, the U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over $21 billion in total net flows, a noteworthy achievement considering the typical challenges faced by new ETFs. By comparison, it took gold ETFs around five years to reach the same level of net inflows. Adding to the 2021 momentum, high-profile endorsements from business leaders, including Tesla (TSLA+8.10%) CEO Elon Musk, played a crucial role in amplifying Bitcoin’s appeal. In 2021, Tesla spent $1.5 billion on the cryptocurrency. Other publicly traded companies also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. As of Dec. 30, 2024, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy owns the most at 446,400 Bitcoin. The entry of financial giants including BlackRock and Fidelity into the crypto world has bolstered the proposition that cryptocurrency could be the future of finance. Financial institutions are working on the tokenization of funds, and they seem to no longer see blockchain as a threat but rather as a tool.

Title: AI takes over CES 2025, one smart gadget at a time

Just when you thought your toaster couldn’t get any smarter, CES 2025 is about to prove you wrong. The world’s biggest tech show returns to Las Vegas from January 7-10, promising to stuff artificial intelligence into literally everything that has a power button. The AI gold rush remains in full swing: Samsung’s going all-in with its “AI for All: Everyday, Everywhere” vision — including AI fridges that promise to anticipate temperature changes when you’re unloading groceries — because apparently your lettuce needed a smart assistant. LG is getting oddly personal with what they’re calling “Affectionate Intelligence” (yes, really). Even Samsung’s startup incubator is showing off AI everything – from video production to exercise coaching to energy management. The message is clear: if your gadget doesn’t have AI in 2025, does it even exist? But this year’s real battleground is AI agents. After 2024's mixed bag of AI companions (pour one out for the Humane Pin and the half-baked Rabbit R1), tech giants are betting that what we really want is AI assistants baked into everything we own. The pitch for these empowered AI bots is that you won’t have to open apps for every little task; this tech promises to handle everything from scheduling your day to ordering your coffee, all through natural conversation. Whether they’ll actually deliver this time – or show any actual affection – remains to be seen. And yes, somehow, the TV industry has found its next revolution: a fancier cable. While the exact specs of HDMI 2.2 are still under wraps, it promises to surpass the impressive 10K resolution and 120Hz refresh rates of HDMI 2.1. Translation: Your movies and games are about to get even prettier, smoother, and more detailed — if you can find any 10K content to actually watch. On the computing front, Nvidia (NVDA+4.42%) CEO Jensen Huang will take the stage for what promises to be another leather-jacketed keynote about next-gen GPUs. Industry leaks suggest the RTX 5090 could be up to 70% faster than its predecessor, which already had “unholy power,” according to one reviewer. Not to be outdone, Intel and AMD are also expected to announce chips that will make your current gaming rig feel like a calculator. Speaking of chips, 2025 is shaping up to be the year PC makers try to convince you that your computer isn’t smart enough. After 2024's first wave of AI PCs with Copilot+ buttons and 16GB RAM requirements, Microsoft’s (MSFT+0.88%) next generation promises even more powerful NPUs and AI features. Dell, HP, and friends are hoping you’ll upgrade your Windows 10 machine (which loses support next year) to a shiny new AI-powered PC. Just don’t expect an immediate productivity boost – studies show current AI PC owners actually spend more time figuring out how to talk to their computers than getting actual work done. But hey, at least you’ll feel fancy while your PC makes you feel technologically illiterate. The auto industry continues its transformation into a tech show within a tech show. Hyundai’s Mobis division is set to steal some spotlight with what they’re calling the world’s first full-windshield holographic display. This isn’t just a fancy heads-up display, it’s a screen that spans from driver to passenger, promising to overlay navigation, vehicle info, and safety alerts across your entire field of view. Think Iron Man’s helmet display, but for your car. BMW’s not far behind, planning to debut their own take with something called the Panoramic iDrive display. About 100,000 tech enthusiasts, industry professionals, and AI chatbots (kidding — that would make it more like 200,000) will descend upon the Las Vegas Convention Center and Venetian Expo for the event. As always, CES promises to show us the future, or at least what tech companies think we’ll buy in the near future. Whether all these innovations actually make it to market in 2025 is another story entirely, but hey, that’s half the fun of CES. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

RBI는 은행이 대출 손실을 충당하는 방식을 기존의 발생 손실 접근 방식에서 예상 신용 손실 모델로 '전환할 것'을 제안했습니다. 올해 최종 가이드라인이 발표될 예정이며, 국영 은행에 미치는 '재정적 영향'이 민간 은행보다 클 것으로 보입니다. 5. 더 나아가 억만장자들의 배틀 India's cities have neither resources nor leadership, writes @andymukherjee70.

Here's how a roaring nineties style stock boom is redefining India's markets https://t.co/NwuYMmw6MV Venture Intelligence '데이터'에 따르면 2024년에는 74건의 대형 거래(각각 1억 달러 이상)가 총 207억 달러에 달하는 반면, 2023년 75건의 거래(232억 달러)는 소폭 조정되었습니다.

A key gauge of the Indian rupee’s volatility jumped to its highest level in over a year, fueling speculation that the nation’s central bank may be easing its tight grip on the currency amid a strong US dollar https://t.co/jAOOB0oubY Rupee ends at record closing low for seventh straight session https://t.co/Q3Svg01OWN pic.twitter.com/p3Lk9htI5Z 목표는 힘들고 종종 혼란스러운 법을 간결하고 명확하며 소송의 소지를 줄이는 것입니다. 봄베이 상공회의소는 2022년 '데이터'를 인용해 10조 루피가 넘는 직접 세금 요구가 소송에 휘말려 있다고 밝혔습니다. India’s central bank has started to rein in its ballooning non-deliverable forwards book, sources say, shifting away from one of its key tools to push back against the strong dollar https://t.co/rsNtdcORnz The dollar is headed for its best year in almost a decade, with the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rising over 7% so far this year https://t.co/qGYRBTeOok The selling by foreign investors of Indian stocks in 2024 was the second highest in a decade as announcement of a stimulus package in China, rich valuations, rising US bond yields and subdued second-quarter earnings resulted in risk-off sentiment.https://t.co/j9nuDpDtd3 '모디' 행정부는 또한 '특정 재정 적자'(FY26 GDP의 4.5%)를 목표로 하는 것에서 FY27에는 GDP 대비 부채 비율로 전환할 계획이며, 이를 위한 프레임워크는 올해 공개될 예정입니다. Investors will zero in on earnings growth to pick out new winners, as Indian stocks aim to extend an unprecedented annual streak despite economic challenges https://t.co/cMJlKPT5iw Some big lenders in India have asked the central bank to inject liquidity using foreign-exchange swaps as short-term currency financing costs surged to a four-year high, sources say https://t.co/owusgzFgRK 블룸버그 통신은 이전에 새로운 징조(glide path)가 중앙 정부 부채를 GDP의 58.2%에서 50%로 줄이는 것을 목표로 할 것이라고 '보도'한 바 있습니다. 새로운 일정은 '모디' 총리가 3기 동안 인프라, 사회 계획 및 성장을 촉진하기 위해 얼마나 많은 지출 여력을 확보할지 명확하게 보여줄 것입니다. 4. 크레디트 퀄리티는 철저히 검증될 것입니다. India’s policymakers differed on the timing for interest rate cuts as growth remains weak and volatile food prices keep inflation high, minutes of the RBI’s monetary policy committee meeting showed https://t.co/DNHjXNO0oP Bad loan ratios in Indian banks are expected to worsen, the Reserve Bank of India said in a report https://t.co/mRwxYJVLql Indian banks' gross bad loan ratio may edge up by March 2026, central bank report says https://t.co/2FJ93HqS0x pic.twitter.com/I5e9yqKkdk #Loan against #gold on rise, #RBI raises concerns over irregular practices involved in #GoldLoanshttps://t.co/Gv7JDVGJRx 소비자 대출 및 소액 금융 부문의 지속적인 스트레스와 회계 규칙의 변경은 신용 품질에 대한 철저한 조사를 '촉발'할 것입니다. 인도 중앙은행은 은행 전체의 총 부실채권 비율이 2024년 9월 다년간의 최저치인 2.6%에서 2026년 3%로, 비은행의 경우 2.9%에서 3.4%로 상승할 것으로 '예상'하고 있습니다. 그러나 RBI는 은행과 비은행권 금융업체의 자본 수준이 건전성 기준을 훨씬 상회하고 있다고 '지적'했습니다. Indian banks to stick with certificates of deposit after 2024 supply jumps 50% https://t.co/pYZDUDiOEp pic.twitter.com/vXJVSaIMGG Overseas investors turned net sellers of Indian stocks last year as concerns over a slowing economy and higher valuations spooked sentiment https://t.co/NPG3SxFKAY Indian states' fundraising may get expensive amid record borrowing, investors say https://t.co/gFrW4K4vNJ pic.twitter.com/05dnGlu31K 올해 은행들은 2022년부터 논의되어 온 회계 규칙 변경에도 직면해 있습니다. RBI는 은행이 대출 손실을 충당하는 방식을 기존의 발생 손실 접근 방식에서 예상 신용 손실 모델로 '전환할 것'을 제안했습니다. 올해 최종 가이드라인이 발표될 예정이며, 국영 은행에 미치는 '재정적 영향'이 민간 은행보다 클 것으로 보입니다. 5. 더 나아가 억만장자들의 배틀 India's cities have neither resources nor leadership, writes @andymukherjee70. They need to be in control of their own destinies to break a cycle of mediocrity https://t.co/OoFqHUWrLi India’s booming and coal-dependent steel industry means the country faces a “rocky and uncertain path” toward achieving its goal of reaching net zero by 2070, according to Global Energy Monitor https://t.co/l09Eb7dV7t While analysts have turned more bullish on Mukesh Ambani's Reliance recently, institutional investors are expressing concerns over increasing debt and its ability to generate positive cash flows https://t.co/XEYsiTtiuF India’s state oil refiners are finding it hard to buy the volume of Russian crude they need, sources say https://t.co/4gMR2bcWkY Musk's meeting with the South African president could let SpaceX deploy Starlink in exchange for a Tesla battery plant.https://t.co/hLpcRPDCb7 테슬라(TSLA) '일론 머스크'와 인도 억만장자 '무케시 암바니', 수닐 미탈, '쿠마르 망갈람 비를라'가 인도에서 광대역 '위성' 인터넷 서비스를 제공하기 위한 전장이 될 것입니다. 카플레이, 자율주행 등 차량에도 인터넷이 필요하죠. 전기차는 스마트폰과 연동됩니다. '일론 머스크'는 X(트위터)를 '페이팔'처럼 결재 시스템을 쓰는 모바일 뱅킹으로 만들어 비트코인으로 테슬라(TSLA)를 결재려던 것으로 알려졌습니다. Swiggy ends listing day with 17% gain over IPO issue price. What this reveals#SwiggyIPO https://t.co/wF92deL0RQ In India, an act of financial alchemy helped put $180,000 e-buses on the road at little upfront cost.It could be a model for the developing world https://t.co/ruyPKdWXhA Ola Electric announces opening of 3,200 new stores in a single day, as India’s biggest e-scooter maker seeks to expand its local footprint and address customer frustration related to shortcomings in service https://t.co/SjXgWmq4Uz 소매업에서도 신생 기업인 Zomato와 'Swiggy'가 주도하며 모바일 결재가 주류로 자리잡은 퀵 커머스와 Ambani's Reliance, 이커머스 대기업 Amazon과 같은 오프라인 소매 체인 간의 충돌이 더 많이 발생할 것입니다. Ambani의 승리에 따라 그의 통신 및 소매 벤처가 올해 오랫동안 보류 중인 IPO를 시작할지 '여부가 결정'될 것입니다. India's Adani Wilmar falls on Adani group's plan to offload stake https://t.co/24uygOck7J pic.twitter.com/tewboVHzvW An entity majority-owned by Gautam Adani, who was indicted in US courts last month, has withdrawn its request for a $553 million loan from the US International Development Finance Corporation https://t.co/ju15PRzf65 Brooklyn US Attorney Breon Peace said he will step down Jan. 10, ending a stint as federal prosecutor that included the trials of R Kelly, Gautam Adani and a US Congressman https://t.co/zNV2oTqjoZ Paragon may well be the best Mallu/South Indian fish/seafood/coastal restaurant in the world Kozhikode’s Paragon secures fifth spot on global list of iconic restaurants https://t.co/QPS6MMAJiB For years, farmer Fatehbir Singh Sidhu harvested his rice and then set the fields on fire. The practice was far from unique — thousands of growers around him in the Indian state of Punjab still do the same to swiftly clear land for the next sowing cycle. https://t.co/G5yAir2fVz 연방준비제도(Fed·연준)은 H4L을 '점도표'에 찍어놨고, '트럼프'는 인플레이션을 촉발할 '관세'로 설처대고 있죠. 소비자는 저가 상품을 스마트폰으로 검색을 하고 주문을 하는데, 인터넷 보급률이 여전히 '49%'에 불과하지만 모든 국민들이 스마트폰을 사용하고 있는 것을 감안하면, 이 시장이 노다지가 '될 수 밖에' 없습니다 Work on a Sri Lankan port’s expansion led by the Adani Group is progressing as scheduled, a top local official says https://t.co/x1iIhRLKc8 DP World, a United Arab Emirates-based port operator, plans to expand in India to alleviate trade bottlenecks https://t.co/oOPP2fnoGx India's Adani Group to invest over $88 bln in Rajasthan state, exec says https://t.co/nAOgPLxXWc pic.twitter.com/3ub6xfx4cj While 2024 was a rough year for India’s Ambani and Adani, tech billionaires in China came out on top with big wealth gains.@advait_px explains https://t.co/5pbD012iqv pic.twitter.com/VzVUaq0xlA China is pressing ahead with plans to construct a mega-dam that could be the world's biggest near its contested border with India https://t.co/krZPNj3dEm China has approved the construction of what will be the world's largest hydropower dam, kicking off an ambitious project on the eastern rim of the Tibetan plateau that could affect millions downstream in India and Bangladesh. https://t.co/zyaLwfRHjB pic.twitter.com/fCPHg4jMVN India — which relies on coal to meet about three-quarters of electricity demand — kept installations of new capacity near a five-year high to try to meet surging power usage https://t.co/AmmlqyzVSR Adani's troubles may leave a trail of winners and losers, writes @andymukherjee70. Some rivals will get time to fortify their moats, while India’s energy industry may witness deeper changes https://t.co/mCl1ozeTNS 한편, 미국 법무부에 기소된 가우탐 '아다니'는 차기 '트럼프' 행정부와 자신의 항구-권력 제국을 확장하고 국가 시멘트 시장을 통합하기 위해 'Birla'와 경쟁하면서 뇌물 수수 혐의를 받을지 여부를 기다리고 있습니다.

Title: As Hope of Santa Claus Rally Fades, What's Next for Stocks in 2025?
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/santa-claus-rally-hopes-fade-what-next-for-stocks-in-2025-8768365
Time Published: 2025-01-02T21:57:46Z
Full Content:
Santa may not be visiting Wall Street this year after all. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% on Thursday and has lost ground in five straight sessions, giving investors little hope of getting a Santa Claus rally, which is the tendency for stocks to rise during the last five sessions of a year and the first two of the new year. The index would have to rise 1.8% on Friday to get back into positive territory for the seven-day period this year. Granted, 2024 was an exceptional year for stocks, even without an end-of-year boost. The S&P 500 rose more than 20% for a second straight year, its first such stretch this millennium. But a Santa Claus rally is more than just a cherry on top of a year; it’s sometimes also seen as an omen. The Santa Claus rally is historically correlated with stocks’ January and full-year performance. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has, on average, returned 1.4% in January and 10.4% in the calendar year after a Santa Claus rally, according to a recent analysis by LPL Financial. (The S&P 500 was launched in 1957; stock performance before this year is based on its predecessor index, the S&P 90.) In years without a Santa Claus rally, the index’s average January return has been slightly negative and its full-year return has averaged just 5%. While the odds of a Santa Claus rally appeared slim on Thursday, stock market experts remain optimistic about the prospects for 2025. Stocks are generally expected to be supported by incoming President Donald Trump, who has vowed to extend the corporate tax cuts of his first term and slash regulations. The U.S. economy’s continued strength is also expected to underpin corporate profits, which experts believe will broaden after two years of narrow leadership. The Magnificent Seven stocks are still expected to grow profit faster than the average S&P 500 company, but by the slimmest margin in seven years, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze is also seen evolving this year as the use of AI becomes more widespread. A small number of companies—most of them semiconductor and networking hardware companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO)—have thus far benefited from the AI revolution. Experts believe a greater variety of companies will begin to reap those benefits in 2025 as new infrastructure comes online and businesses find novel applications for the technology. Donald Trump is known for treating the stock market’s performance as a proxy for the success of his administration. Yet, his impending presidency is a major source of uncertainty, which could make for a bumpy ride this year. Many of Trump’s signature policy proposals, if implemented, could have knock-on effects that drag on stocks. His proposed tariffs could help stoke inflation by disrupting global supply chains and raising costs for businesses. Deportations of the magnitude Trump has promised would likely also boost inflation. Resurgent inflation could force Federal Reserve officials to keep interest rates at a level they deem “restrictive,” which would stifle consumer demand and put extra pressure on businesses. Higher interest rates also would likely translate to higher bond yields and a stronger dollar, both of which would weigh on riskier assets like stocks.

Title: As Hope of Santa Claus Rally Fades, What's Next for Stocks in 2025?

Santa may not be visiting Wall Street this year after all. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% on Thursday and has lost ground in five straight sessions, giving investors little hope of getting a Santa Claus rally, which is the tendency for stocks to rise during the last five sessions of a year and the first two of the new year. The index would have to rise 1.8% on Friday to get back into positive territory for the seven-day period this year. Granted, 2024 was an exceptional year for stocks, even without an end-of-year boost. The S&P 500 rose more than 20% for a second straight year, its first such stretch this millennium. But a Santa Claus rally is more than just a cherry on top of a year; it’s sometimes also seen as an omen. The Santa Claus rally is historically correlated with stocks’ January and full-year performance. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has, on average, returned 1.4% in January and 10.4% in the calendar year after a Santa Claus rally, according to a recent analysis by LPL Financial. (The S&P 500 was launched in 1957; stock performance before this year is based on its predecessor index, the S&P 90.) In years without a Santa Claus rally, the index’s average January return has been slightly negative and its full-year return has averaged just 5%. While the odds of a Santa Claus rally appeared slim on Thursday, stock market experts remain optimistic about the prospects for 2025. Stocks are generally expected to be supported by incoming President Donald Trump, who has vowed to extend the corporate tax cuts of his first term and slash regulations. The U.S. economy’s continued strength is also expected to underpin corporate profits, which experts believe will broaden after two years of narrow leadership. The Magnificent Seven stocks are still expected to grow profit faster than the average S&P 500 company, but by the slimmest margin in seven years, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze is also seen evolving this year as the use of AI becomes more widespread. A small number of companies—most of them semiconductor and networking hardware companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO)—have thus far benefited from the AI revolution. Experts believe a greater variety of companies will begin to reap those benefits in 2025 as new infrastructure comes online and businesses find novel applications for the technology. Donald Trump is known for treating the stock market’s performance as a proxy for the success of his administration. Yet, his impending presidency is a major source of uncertainty, which could make for a bumpy ride this year. Many of Trump’s signature policy proposals, if implemented, could have knock-on effects that drag on stocks. His proposed tariffs could help stoke inflation by disrupting global supply chains and raising costs for businesses. Deportations of the magnitude Trump has promised would likely also boost inflation. Resurgent inflation could force Federal Reserve officials to keep interest rates at a level they deem “restrictive,” which would stifle consumer demand and put extra pressure on businesses. Higher interest rates also would likely translate to higher bond yields and a stronger dollar, both of which would weigh on riskier assets like stocks.

The shake-up comes three weeks before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and it's the latest sign of how tech companies are positioning themselves for a new administration in Washington. Clegg, a former British deputy prime minister, said he is stepping down, citing the new year as the right time to move on. He'll be replaced by Kaplan, who will take on the title of chief global affairs officer. Kaplan was White House deputy chief of staff under former President George W. Bush, and he appeared at the New York Stock Exchange with Vice President-elect JD Vance and Trump in December. He also attended Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing in 2018 as a personal friend, causing a controversy for the social media company. "I will look forward to spending a few months handing over the reins — and to representing the company at a number of international gatherings in Q1 of this year," Clegg wrote in a memo to his staff that he shared on Facebook on Thursday. Clegg joined the company in 2018 after a career in British politics with the Liberal Democrats party, and he helped Meta navigate incredible scrutiny, especially over the company's influence on elections and its efforts to control harmful content. Clegg also helped steer the company through the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which Facebook shared user data with third-party political consultants. He also represented the company in Washington and London, frequently at panels for artificial intelligence and at congressional hearings. "My time at the company coincided with a significant resetting of the relationship between 'big tech' and the societal pressures manifested in new laws, institutions and norms affecting the sector," Clegg wrote. In his note, Clegg said Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman, would replace Kaplan as Meta's vice president of global policy. He mentioned that Kaplan would work closely with David Ginsburg, the company's vice president of global communications and public affairs. "Nick: I'm grateful for everything you've done for Meta and the world these past seven years," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. "You've ... built a strong team to carry this work forward. I'm excited for Joel to step into this role next given his deep experience and insight leading our policy work for many years."

Title: Report: Apple Has Halted Production Of Its Colossally Expensive Vision Pro VR
URL: https://kotaku.com/apple-vision-pro-vr-mixed-reality-report-1851731279
Time Published: 2025-01-02T18:15:00Z
Full Content:
Apple has certainly carved itself a market for selling extremely well-made products at ludicrously high prices. Given an audience willing to fork out eye-watering amounts for its laptops and phones, it’s perhaps not surprising that the company assumed it could do the same in the cursed world of VR with the $3,500 Vision Pro mixed-reality goggles. Except, according to sourced reports, it couldn’t. The Vision Pro is said to no longer be in production. This is all based on a report from October 2024 on The Information (a site that, appositely, charges $300 to $1,000 a year to read its articles) which claimed, based on multiple sources, that Apple would be winding down production on the Vision Pro as the year ended, given the backlog of unsold devices. There was also rumor of a cheaper model going into production instead of a previously planned second version of the Pro, potentially for an end-of-year 2025 release. The Vision Pro’s failure to set the world aflame is perhaps somewhat predictable. Not only does absolutely no one actually want mixed-reality headsets for their work life, but they especially don’t want to pay the price of a second-hand car for the honor. At $3.5k, you’d have to hope the Vision Pro came with a suite of absolutely essential apps and uses, and, er, it didn’t do that either. Back in October, The Information said its sources at component manufacturers told the site they’d supplied enough parts for over half a million headsets, with “tens of thousands of undelivered parts” filling the suppliers’ warehouses. It was claimed at the time that Apple had sold 370,000 Vision Pros—a figure that seems enormously optimistic, but one that allegedly represents only two-thirds of the stock that had been made. Compare that to the millions of units Meta has shifted of its Meta Quest VR headsets, at a seventh of the price of Apple’s tech. If all this proves to be accurate, that means that as of now Apple is no longer making new Vision Pros, because just not enough people saw a reason to pay such a whacking fee for such an entirely superfluous piece of tech. As MacRumors points out, Apple had reportedly originally asked its Chinese manufacturer to expect to make eight million Vision Pros, meaning it’s likely sold a twentieth of its initial expectations. The reports claim Apple has told the manufacturer to expect to make half that many for its next, cheaper version of the AR headset which, while suggesting a massive drop in expectation even at a cheaper price, still seems ludicrously unlikely. Meta’s relative success with the Quest VR headsets in 2024 is likely due to its finding that sweet price point of $300 to $500, where people are more willing to take a gamble on a piece of unproven tech. Arguably, Apple could still find its niche in this space, if it can get things down to $1,000 and capture the business market that feels obliged to jump on gimmicks, leading to overworked people in hot suits being forced to look at virtual Power Point demonstrations until they quit their jobs and take up macrame. We’ve contacted Apple for a comment. .

Title: Top Climate Group for Banks, Insurers, and Asset Managers Is Making Changes
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2025/01/02/806684.htm
Time Published: 2025-01-02T16:34:10Z
Full Content:
The world’s biggest climate coalition for financial firms is making adjustments after several high-profile banks, insurers and asset managers opted out. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which was established in 2021 and operates as an umbrella group for numerous industry-specific climate alliances, will change its relationship with those sub groups, according to a person familiar with the decision who declined to be identified. In practice, it means companies will be able to draw on GFANZ for guidance and assistance, but won’t need to align their operations with the goals of the Paris climate agreement, the person said. The move comes after net zero alliances lost a number of key members against a backdrop of political backlash and regulatory overlap. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. both quit the Net-Zero Banking Alliance [in December]. Last year, a sub group for insurers was hit by a mass exodus amid litigation threats. And in 2022, an equivalent group for asset managers parted ways with Vanguard Group Inc., the world’s second-largest money manager. Read more: Global Insurers’ Climate Alliance Relaunches After Member Exodus GFANZ was formed more than 3 1/2 years ago in the run-up to the COP26 United Nations climate conference in Scotland. Back then, it had two aims: to raise the number of financial institutions committing to net zero, and to facilitate industry discussion on the challenges of the low-carbon transition. Going forward, GFANZ will allow “any financial institution working to mobilize capital and lower the barriers to financing energy transition to participate,” according to a statement from the group. “Without private finance, there can be no global energy transition,” GFANZ said. “For that reason, in 2025 and beyond, GFANZ will redouble its efforts to mobilize private capital.” Under GFANZ’s new structure, companies that aren’t members of a net zero group will be free to work with the alliance, the person familiar said. The change also may make it easier for companies based in emerging economies that haven’t set 2050 net zero goals to seek some form of GFANZ affiliation. While GFANZ has grown in prominence — it now has more than 700 members — it also has become a target of US Republicans who accuse such alliances of functioning as anti fossil-fuel cartels. Such accusations have coincided with an increase in investigations and lawsuits targeting firms perceived to be embracing a pro-climate agenda. With President-elect Donald Trump due to return to the White House in January, the pressure on climate groups is expected to intensify. In addition to bringing together eight sector-specific alliances spanning asset owners to venture capital, GFANZ has been a key actor in efforts to finance the early retirement of coal assets in Asia. What’s more, it’s provided guidance and insights on topics such as transition planning and portfolio alignment. (GFANZ is co-chaired by Mark Carney, who is chair of Bloomberg Inc. and a former Bank of England governor, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.)

Title: The 14 predictions that came true in 2024 — and the 10 that didn’t

And that’s where you come in. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The 24 forecasts we made in 2024, revisited. by Bryan Walsh, Dylan Matthews, Marina Bolotnikova, Sigal Samuel, Kenny Torrella, and Izzie Ramirez Making predictions is a tricky business, and here at Future Perfect, we don’t pretend to have a crystal ball. But we do think there’s real epistemic value in putting our forecasts out there and — just as importantly — owning up to how they turned out. (Something that happens too rarely in the media, as we learned after November’s election.) Looking back at our predictions for 2024, we had a wild ride trying to anticipate a year that threw more than a few curveballs our way. For 2024, we made 24 predictions in total, covering everything from who would win the White House to whether Elon Musk could actually get those Cybertrucks on the road. When the dust settled, we got 14 right and 10 wrong — batting .583. That’s Shohei Ohtani on a hot streak, though down somewhat from our 2023 results. But I did say it was a topsy-turvy year. Some calls were right on the money, though. We correctly saw Trump’s comeback and the GOP taking back the Senate. We nailed it when we said Oppenheimer would grab Best Picture (I mean, who didn’t love watching Cillian Murphy brood for three hours?). And we were spot-on about some big international news, like Claudia Sheinbaum making history as Mexico’s first woman president and Modi keeping his grip on power in India. But hey, nobody’s perfect. We thought the FDA would greenlight MDMA therapy for PTSD — that was a swing and a miss. We seriously underestimated how many Cybertrucks Tesla would crank out. And while we got some tech predictions right (looking at you, Waymo and SpaceX), we whiffed on predicting OpenAI’s moves. The whole point isn’t just to keep score — it’s about getting better at this prediction thing through practice and learning from our mistakes. And in a world that seems to get more unpredictable by the day, we think that’s a pretty useful skill to develop. —Bryan Walsh I like to imagine that at least one incredibly sheltered person is learning this fact from this article: Donald Trump was elected to a second nonconsecutive term as president. There wasn’t much courage or confidence in this prediction, which I put at only 55 percent odds. My basic approach was to try to use a political science model incorporating national polling, and I came up with a prediction of a narrow Trump victory. President Joe Biden was fairly unpopular, and Trump was narrowly leading him in polling. I wasn’t confident that advantage would persist — but it did. I will say that if I had updated my prediction throughout the year, it would have changed a lot. I remember in June, before the disastrous Biden-Trump debate, telling friends I gave Trump a 75 percent chance to win; after the debate, I bumped it up to around 90 percent. When Vice President Kamala Harris replaced Biden and surged in polling compared to her predecessor, I reverted to something like 50-50 odds. The actual race and its contours were changing dramatically, and my sense of the race changed dramatically too. Almost by coincidence, the ultimate election wound up being the narrow contest that polling would’ve predicted at the end of 2023. —Dylan Matthews I think my past self explained the reasoning here well: “There are many, many ways for Republicans to retake the Senate. Everything has to go right simultaneously for Democrats to keep it.” Everything did not go right simultaneously for Democrats this election. They had already lost a seat forever when Joe Manchin decided to retire in West Virginia, a place where no other Democrat-caucusing candidate could ever win, which left them with a 50-seat maximum in 2024. Then they lost Sherrod Brown in Ohio and Jon Tester in Montana, red states that were going to be tough for Democrats to hang on to in a presidential election year. Then, in something of a shock, Pennsylvania’s Bob Casey was defeated by a private equity multimillionaire who doesn’t really live in the state and can’t tell the Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers apart. When that guy wins, you know Democrats are having a bad year. On the plus side, it could’ve been much, much worse for Democrats. Despite Harris losing Arizona, Democrat Ruben Gallego won the Senate race there narrowly. Tammy Baldwin barely hung on in Wisconsin, and Elissa Slotkin won an open seat in Michigan by 0.3 percentage points, even as those two states went for Trump. If the Senate results had followed the presidential map, Republicans would have a 56-seat majority and no trouble confirming anyone Trump wants in his Cabinet. Instead, they ended up with 53 seats, which might be just small enough to cause Trump actual trouble. —DM My reasoning here was that Republicans held a very small majority in the House going into the election, and Democrats seemed likely to pick up a number of seats in New York in particular due to redistricting. Sure enough, the party picked up three seats in New York, but lost others to pick up only one seat on net — not enough to flip the chamber. In my defense, I was clear this might happen, writing, “There’s still an easy-to-imagine world where Republicans hold the House, especially if Trump wins the presidential race and if he pulls out a popular vote victory this time.” As it happens, that is the world we live in. But with 220 Republicans in the House and 218 needed to pass anything, there might not be much that Trump can do with this majority. —DM I have not always had the best track record when it comes to inflation predictions, but this one worked out. It was clear in 2023 that inflation had started to decline rapidly in the wake of the Fed’s interest rate hikes, and that decline continued through 2024, enough so that the Fed was able to start cutting again. By the Fed’s preferred measure — the personal consumption expenditures price index, minus food and energy — prices grew by 2.8 percent from October 2023 through October 2024. That’s an annual rate below 3 points, though not by a whole lot. The Fed’s goal is to get the number down to 2 percent. I find it hard to see prices stabilizing that much, especially if tariffs from the Trump administration cause consumer prices to spike in a one-off event. But we’re clearly doing better than a few years ago. —DM I like to make this prediction mainly to draw our readers’ attention to the scandalous number of Americans killed by our transportation system. In 2023, according to statistics released this year by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, that number dropped by about 3.6 percent from 2022, to a still-abysmal 40,990, a figure that remains significantly elevated after a Covid-era spike erased more than a decade of progress in reducing car crash deaths. How many is that, exactly? It’s about as many Americans as are killed by guns and more than double the number killed in homicides overall, though it’s far fewer than the numbers of Americans who die from diseases like heart disease and cancer. It’s twice the number of people killed by cars in the European Union, even though the EU has 100 million more people. And the federal car fatality statistics are actually around 10 percent lower than the true number of Americans killed by cars because they exclude some cases, including crashes on private roads and parking lots. If today’s rates remained steady, a rough estimate would suggest that about 1 percent of all Americans would be killed by cars — a stunningly high cost of admission into our car-dependent society. —Marina Bolotnikova I almost always predict that Netanyahu will stay in power, but I made an exception when writing last year’s predictions because the Israeli public was so incredibly furious at him after Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Polls were showing that voters wanted him out — by a wide margin. I figured if ever there was a time when he could be pushed out, this was it. But even this wasn’t enough. Israel has a parliamentary system, where governments typically form on the basis of coalitions. Netanyahu is really, really good at pacifying his allies in the governing coalition — and they have kept him in power. —Sigal Samuel Climate change is very obviously making its effects felt. This summer was the hottest on record globally. By November, scientists said this year is “virtually certain” to break 2023’s record. They also noted that 2024 marks the first year that Earth is more than 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than in the pre-industrial period. Sadly, this prediction was a pretty solid bet: You can make it every year and you’ll get it right about 80 percent of the time. As my colleague Kelsey Piper has noted, “This is based on looking at the last 25 years of atmospheric temperature data: On average, in four out of five years, this prediction would be right.” —SS Modi secured a third straight term as India’s prime minister after this spring’s massive elections, which saw over 640 million voters turn out. It’s an achievement equaled only by India’s founding prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and one that was about as easy to predict as any outcome in this record-breaking year of global elections. Modi rolled into the elections with an approval rating in the mid-70s, or roughly twice as high as Biden’s popularity around the same time. In a year when incumbent leaders around the world fell in election after election, Modi and his BJP party were a sure thing — so much so that my only regret was not choosing a probability of 99 percent. Even so, this election did not turn out the way many prognosticators expected, myself included. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance secured a majority in Parliament with 293 seats, but that was well short of the 400 seats the alliance was shooting for. And the BJP itself only won 240 seats, a significant drop from the 303 seats it had won in the previous election. As a result, the party lost its solo majority in the lower house of parliament for the first time in 10 years. As my colleague Josh Keating wrote, the results were bad for Modi but good for India as a whole, showing that the world’s biggest democracy remains a democracy. An overwhelming victory would have fed into Modi’s growing authoritarian inclinations, which were on display this year as the Indian government attacked critics at home and abroad — including in the US. India was a rare example in 2024 of the people successfully pushing back against a would-be autocrat. —BW There was no courage in the prediction that the massively popular, but term-limited, left-wing President Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador (AMLO) would be succeeded by his protégée, Claudia Sheinbaum, a past mayor of Mexico City and climate scientist. The polling, even that early on, showed Sheinbaum with a massive lead over challenger Xóchitl Gálvez, an indication of both Sheinbaum’s talent and the popularity of AMLO and his Morena party. Sheinbaum’s election was historic: She is not only the first woman elected president of Mexico, but the first Jewish person and (to the best of my knowledge) the first scientist. Climate advocates shouldn’t be too sanguine, though. Despite her professional background, Sheinbaum has no interest in shrinking the popular state-owned petroleum sector. —DM After the chaos of 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and 2023, when Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner Group of mercenaries mutinied and nearly took Moscow, 2024 was a less momentous year in the war. There were major shifts, to be sure: Ukraine seized part of the Kursk region in Russia, giving it Russian land it might be able to trade for Ukrainian territory now under Russian occupation, and North Korea sent troops to the front line, signaling both that Russia has serious allies in the war and that it’s desperate enough to call upon them. But there were no major battlefield breakthroughs, and one of the biggest goals of the Ukrainian military (splitting Russian troops on the Crimean peninsula from troops in the Donbas, the east of Ukraine) did not come to pass. Here is the map of military control I used in last year’s predictions: This is what the map looks like today: If you look carefully, you can see some modest differences between the maps. But overall, they’re nearly identical. The lines of control haven’t moved much in the past year, and with Trump ascending to office and seemingly hostile to extending aid to the Ukrainian military, the future is looking rather grim for Ukrainians defending their sovereignty. —DM I don’t feel too bummed about having erred in my prediction here because the FDA’s rejection came as a surprise to almost everyone involved. When I made this prediction a year ago, patients, therapists, and policymakers alike were anticipating that Lykos Therapeutics, the company trying to get MDMA-assisted therapy approved, would be successful. After all, Lykos had collaborated with the FDA on the trial design, and the latter had signed off on the methodology. But in March, a report raised fresh concerns about the trial design and unreported adverse events. In May and June, more researchers and advocates started to sound the alarm — not just about the psychedelic part of psychedelic-assisted therapy but about the therapy part. Some went so far as to accuse Lykos of being a “therapy cult,” one with a style that could increase risk to patients. Ultimately, the FDA responded to this new information by deciding not to approve Lykos’s application. —SS Did OpenAI release a whole lot of stuff in 2024? It sure did — so much so that the company decided to rebrand 12 days during the holiday season this December as “Shipmas,” releasing everything from ChatGPT Pro (a $200/month plan that includes unlimited access to its top model OpenAI o1) to its video creation model Sora to something called “Santa mode.” The blizzard of product shipping — one matched by competitors like Google and Meta — is a sign of what my colleague Kelsey Piper identified as a shift in AI, away from a single-minded focus on advancing technical progress and toward creating products that people will actually be able to use (and even more importantly, given how expensive frontier AI work is, actually buy). It came as concerns were growing over whether AI was hitting a scaling wall and AI companies were hitting “peak data.” But as I wrote last year, “for the purposes of this prediction, OpenAI will need to release a product called ‘ChatGPT-5’ — no ‘ChatGPT-4.5 Turbo’ or whatever.” Whether because it was running out of data or because it didn’t want to lock itself into ever-escalating model versions, OpenAI did not. I’ll take the L. —BW 2024 was a banner year for SpaceX’s Starship, which saw four test launches. The first in March is a difficult case for my prediction: While the launch itself was successful, the booster stage burned up while hurtling back to the ocean and the ship itself appears to have disintegrated at some point. I predicted that neither stage would “explode,” and it’s hard to know if either did in this test. They certainly didn’t operate the way SpaceX had hoped. Luckily for the company, and for my prediction, its three subsequent launches were all smashing successes. In its June 6 launch, the booster and second stage splashed down, intact, in the Gulf of Mexico and Indian Ocean respectively. The November 19 launch, viewed in person by SpaceX founder Elon Musk’s political ally Donald Trump, got the same results. But the one for the history books came on October 13, when the booster stage returned not to the Gulf of Mexico but to the very same launchpad in Texas from whence it came, where it was caught by two massive mechanical “chopsticks.” Whatever else you think about Musk — and I think a lot of negative things — that was a fairly awe-inspiring achievement, and easily met my prediction that the Starship project would notch major successes this year. —DM I biffed this one pretty bad. For quarters one through three of 2024, Cybertruck sales totaled 28,250 in the US. Anecdotally, they seem to be everywhere in Washington, DC. My rationale was that the extremely unusual design of the truck, complete with a metal rather than painted exterior and a truly massive windshield, would prove challenging to produce at scale. Moreover, Tesla tends to operate with extreme delays, which made me pessimistic that it would meet its timelines for the vehicle. Ultimately, though, it’s a company with a lot of experience building EVs at scale, and the Cybertruck proved to be no exception. I did predict, however, that the nearly 4-foot “monowiper” used on the windshield would break down immediately in inclement weather. Guess what? Tesla had to launch a recall in June over exactly this. —DM The industry leader on self-driving cars, a sister company to Google, entered the year operating in San Francisco and Phoenix but had announced plans to expand to Los Angeles and Austin. The latter city has seen testing among Waymo’s own employees but is not yet available to the general public through either the Waymo One app or Uber (which has partnered with Waymo in Phoenix). In Los Angeles, however, driverless taxi rides are now widely available: In March, Waymo started letting Angelenos off its waitlist so they could hail rides, and as of November 12, anyone in LA County can use the service, without any waitlist. That fits my prediction that at least one city would see driverless rides become widely accessible the way they already were in SF and Phoenix. —DM Most antibiotics sold in the US don’t go to hospitals or pharmacies, but to farms. These antibiotics are used to make animals grow faster and keep them alive in overcrowded, unsanitary factory farms, and they’ve given rise to new antibiotic-resistant “superbugs.” When humans fall ill from these superbugs, the typical course of antibiotics may not do the trick to heal them. Former Future Perfect fellow Miranda Dixon-Luinenburg called the growth in antibiotic resistance a “hidden epidemic.” Tracking the amount of antibiotics sold to meat producers is a good proxy for understanding whether we’re backsliding or making progress on this epidemic, and last year, I predicted antibiotic sales for livestock would have increased by 1 percent in 2023. Instead, they went down by 2 percent. It makes sense that they declined because beef production decreased by almost 5 percent, and cattle account for around 40 percent of livestock antibiotic sales, while pork production remained stable. (I predicted 2023 sales because data is delayed by about a year.) I more or less knew this would happen, as the US Department of Agriculture predicted decreased beef production, and they’re usually right about these things. Nevertheless, I ignored common sense and predicted livestock antibiotic sales would increase because they had been on the rise for the previous five years. It’s a mistake to assume that trend lines will always continue, and a lesson I’ll incorporate into future predictions. —Kenny Torrella Sadly, I was right on this one. Oatly’s stock has remained below $1.40 all year, hitting a low of just 61 cents in mid-November (it peaked at nearly $29 per share in the summer of 2021). It’s been a long fall from grace for the company that single-handedly made oat milk cool, moving it from the fringes of the dairy aisle to seemingly every coffee shop menu in America. As I wrote about last year, the company has been beset by manufacturing problems and an onslaught of imitators. And it just hit another roadblock: In early December, a UK judge decided that Oatly can’t use the word “milk” on its products after a UK dairy trade group sued the company over the matter. It’s part of a larger trend of the livestock industry’s effort to restrict how plant-based companies can market their products. In brighter news, the company recently reported its third-quarter revenue was up about 10 percent compared to 2023, with growth in the main regions in which it operates. Despite a flagging stock price, Oatly is down but not out. —KT The US egg industry is still headed toward a cage-free future, but in 2024, it moved slower in that direction than I thought it would. Instead of amounting to 45 percent of the egg supply, cage-free reached 40.3 percent, just a 1.5 percent increase from late 2023. I was confident it would reach 45 percent for three reasons: Since 2019, the share of egg-laying hens raised cage-free had been growing by about 5 percent annually, several states had cage-free laws — banning the sale and production of caged eggs — going into effect in 2024, and many large food companies had committed to a 100 percent cage-free egg supply by 2025. Why was I so off? I likely discounted the impact the bird flu has had on the US egg industry; in 2024, the virus resulted in the mass killing of 39.6 million hens — almost triple that of 2023. I was also overconfident on corporate progress; according to the animal protection group the Humane League, many large food companies are behind on fulfilling their cage-free pledges. Lastly, I probably overestimated the impact of the 2024 state laws in Nevada, Oregon, and Washington; each have small egg industries and relatively small populations. We might see the pace of progress accelerate in 2025: The states implementing cage-free laws next year — Michigan and Colorado — have a slightly bigger combined population than the three states from last year and, more importantly, they have much bigger egg industries. Meanwhile, the country’s largest egg producer, Cal-Maine, will have a number of new cage-free farms going online in summer 2025. But the ongoing bird flu outbreak — combined with the unpredictability of corporate pledges — could shift the trajectory. —KT I hate that this is true, but I was right on this one two times over. More than 40 million chickens and turkeys were killed in the poultry industry’s H5N1 bird flu outbreak. And that’s just this year — since the outbreak began in early 2022, over 120 million have been culled. Most of those are not killed by the avian flu itself; rather, any time there’s a single detection of the disease at a poultry facility, all of the birds are exterminated, often with gruesome methods, like literally overheating them to death with industrial heaters. Three years into this never-ending nightmare, both the factory farm industry and animal advocates are faced with the reality that the bird flu may be here to stay. And one disturbing development we couldn’t have predicted last year: H5N1 is now pervasive in another farm animal species, dairy cows, across the country. Next year, I think this disease will keep surprising us. —MB My reasoning here was based on criminal trials being incredibly unpredictable — so while I thought it was more likely that at least one animal rights activist would be incarcerated than any other single outcome, I put the probability at less than 50 percent. The prediction was mostly a product of recency bias: Barely a month before we made our 2024 predictions, Wayne Hsiung, one of the most prominent US animal rights activists and a co-founder of the group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), was convicted and sentenced to jail for his involvement in actions at two California factory farms. DxE activists have run many similar actions over the last decade, employing a strategy they call “open rescue,” in which they enter factory farms and other places where animals are exploited, remove a few animals and take them to live at a sanctuary, and invite confrontation with the criminal legal system. The first few criminal cases I covered involving the group ended in either dismissals or miraculous acquittals. But Hsiung’s 2023 jail sentence made it feel like the bill was coming due. This year, I suspected that a long-awaited DxE court case, involving the rescue of three beagles from a company that breeds them for animal testing, would end in prison time because I knew it would be harder for the activists to make a legal argument for acquittal than in farm animal cases. But sure enough, the case was dismissed shortly before trial. More DxE trials are scheduled for next year, but now I know better than to try to predict the outcome. —MB This was a big year for Billie! I didn’t predict her new album or extensive world tour, but it’s not rocket science to know that the academy loves her work. With a previous win for the James Bond theme she did back in 2020, the Song of the Year award was a shoo-in. This year’s Future Perfect 50 honoree and superstar is only missing a Tony and an Emmy for that sweet, sweet EGOT status. —Izzie Ramirez I was wrong on this one — it wound up being Jennifer Lopez who looked beautiful in Schiaparelli. Whichever Kardashian-Jenner decided to read this and prove me wrong: noted. But honestly it’s better this way. J. Lo was a co-chair for the event alongside fashion darling Zendaya, so she needed the extra zhuzh. —IR What did I write last year? “The Academy loves biopics, it loves period pieces, and for some reason, it weirdly loves modern films that feature black-and-white scenes.” To no one’s surprise, Oppenheimer ran away with the show at the 96th Academy Awards, winning seven Oscars, including Best Actor for Cillian Murphy, Best Director for Christopher Nolan, and yes, Best Picture. Hot dog! So, since explaining why something we knew would happen happened is pretty boring, I’m going to instead discuss an all-time-great Oppenheimer-related query posted on the subreddit r/NoStupidQuestions: Well, Rafe_Cameron_OBX, is it weird that your boyfriend watches Oppenheimer for as much as 15 hours a week? I think it depends on a few things. Does he obsessively watch and rewatch the bravura scene of the Trinity test? Has he started mumbling something about being “death, destroyer of worlds” in his sleep? (Assuming he sleeps.) You say he always makes time for you, which is great, but does he insist on reciting lines from the Bhagavad Gita when he’s, uh, making time? While I’m hesitant to interfere in another person’s relationship, if the answer to any of these questions is “yes,” I strongly suggest you drop him immediately. I’m worried that if he doesn’t get treatment he may progress to a more advanced stage of Christopher Nolanism and start making you watch Interstellar three to five times a week. —BW You don’t have to be Bill James to know that two-way baseball super-duper megastar Shohei Ohtani had a pretty good year in 2024, his first with the Los Angeles Dodgers, even though an elbow injury kept him from pitching. He hit .310, good for fifth in the majors. He recorded 130 RBIs (second in the majors) and had an OPS (on-base plus slugging percentage, the gold standard hitting stat) of 1.036, also good for second in baseball. He became the first player in major league history to hit more than 50 homers and steal more than 50 bases, becoming the only player in the 50/50 club. On September 19, he had what many people consider the single best offensive game in the 121-year history of Major League Baseball, going 6-for-6 with three home runs, two doubles, 10 RBIs, and two stolen bases. Oh, and he went on to win a championship, too. The one thing Ohtani did not do is the one thing I predicted he would do: lead the major leagues in home runs in 2024. Ohtani mashed 54 taters, which would have been good enough to at least tie for the majors lead in all but three of the past 24 seasons. Unfortunately, very big boy Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees took the crown this season with 58 home runs. I’ll admit, my mistake here was forgetting that as spectacular as Ohtani is across the board in baseball, the 6-foot-7, 282-pound Judge is really, really good at mashing dingers, at least in the regular season. He flamed out in his championship series against Ohtani’s Dodgers, going 4-for-18 with just one homer and three RBIs, enraging Yankees fans across the country. So even though my prediction failed, I’d say advantage: Ohtani. —BW Correction, January 2, 2025, 10:25 AM ET: An earlier version of this story overstated the number of hens killed in the break flu outbreak in 2024.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks rose on Thursday to kick off the first trading day of the new year as Wall Street returned from holiday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged up 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose above the flat line. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.4% after markets reopened from Wednesday's closure. Markets are eyeing a comeback after a year-end slide to begin the week dented hopes for a "Santa Claus rally." The decline capped a blowout 2024 for US stocks that saw the S&P 500 (^GSPC) post two years in a row of over-20% gains — something it hasn't achieved in almost three decades. Several Big Tech stocks led the market higher with shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) all rising as optimism around artificial intelligence crept back in. Investors have been debating what role the "Magnificent Seven" stocks will play in powering markets in 2025 after their massive outperformance last year. But Tesla (TSLA) shares slid almost 6% after the electric vehicle maker posted its first decline in annual deliveries on Thursday morning. Also in focus was news that a Cybertruck loaded with firework mortars and fuel canisters exploded in Las Vegas on Wednesday, killing one person. The FBI is investigating whether the blast outside the Trump International Hotel was an act of terrorism. Over the holiday week, US mortgage rates rose to 6.97% to reach the highest level since early July, data showed. The gain weighed on applications for home purchases and dented refinancing, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Weekly jobless claims fell to their lowest level since March. Data released by the Department of Labor on Thursday morning showed claims of 211,000, a decrease from the previous week's upwardly revised level of 220,000. On the corporate front, Apple (AAPL) shares fell around 2% after the iPhone maker offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, reflecting rising competition from local handset makers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) erased early morning gains to hover near the flat line by 11:30 a.m. ET on Thursday. A fall in shares of Boeing (BA) weighed on the blue-chip index. The industrial giant's stock dropped as much as 3.5% following Sunday's deadly crash of a 737-800 aircraft operated by Jeju Air in South Korea. Analysts were however quick to point out it's unlikely that the incident was related to Boeing's production challenges last year. Apple (AAPL) shares fell to session lows after the iPhone maker offered rare discounts on its latest devices in China. A man alleged to be linked to the explosion of a Tesla (TSLA) Cybertruck filled with fireworks and gasoline in Las Vegas was a US soldier, according to a report from CNN. "The man connected to the rental of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside of the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday is a US Special Forces soldier assigned to 10th Special Forces Group, per 4 US officials," CNN correspondent Natasha Bertrand wrote on X. "The man is a US Army special forces operations sergeant, holding the rank of master sergeant, a senior enlisted rank, the officials said. Three officials said he was on active duty and was on leave from Germany, where he was serving with 10th Group, at the time of the incident," said the posting. The Cybertruck had been rented on an app called Turo, the same service used to rent the vehicle involved in running over a crowd of people in New Orleans early Wednesday morning. Authorities are investigating whether there is any link between the two incidents. Tesla shares slid almost 6% on Thursday morning after the EV giant posted its first annual delivery decline. The stock is down roughly 18% over the past five trading sessions. Shares of Tesla hit all-time highs in mid-December on the heels of a massive rally following Donald Trump's White House victory in early November. Shares of Cloudflare (NET) jumped more than 5% on Thursday after the cloud platform company received a double upgrade from Goldman Sachs. The analysts said they see a 28% upside for the stock and raised their price target to $140. They upgraded the stock to a Buy from a Sell recommendation. Goldman analysts cited "improving sales and marketing productivity cycle" and "new AI inferencing use cases" AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2% to lead the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) higher on Thursday morning. Other "Magnificent Seven" stocks also helped lift the tech-heavy index, with Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) rising almost 2%. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla (TSLA) pared some of the losses that came after the EV giant posted its first annual decline in deliveries. The stock fell by as much as 6% in early trading. Apple's (AAPL) stock also came off session lows. The iPhone maker has offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, highlighting rising competition from local device makers. Stocks rose on the first trading day of the new year following a holiday break and a roaring 2024 for the markets. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped but quickly erased early session gains. Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped after the electric vehicle giant said it delivered 495,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter of last year, making 2024 the first year of a decline in annual deliveries since 2011, according to Bloomberg data. Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped 3% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle giant said it delivered 495,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2024, bringing total deliveries to roughly 1.79 million for the whole year. Wall Street analysts expected the automaker to deliver roughly 512,300 EVs for the last three months of the year, or about 1.8 million vehicles, In the fourth quarter, Tesla said it produced approximately 459,000 vehicles. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 1% premarket as investors prepared for the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker to release its fourth quarter deliveries Thursday. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report deliveries of roughly 512,300 EVs for the period, bringing its annual deliveries for the 2024 fiscal year to 1.8 million EVs, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks rose on Thursday to kick off the first trading day of the new year as Wall Street returned from holiday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged up 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose above the flat line. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.4% after markets reopened from Wednesday's closure. Markets are eyeing a comeback after a year-end slide to begin the week dented hopes for a "Santa Claus rally." The decline capped a blowout 2024 for US stocks that saw the S&P 500 (^GSPC) post two years in a row of over-20% gains — something it hasn't achieved in almost three decades. Several Big Tech stocks led the market higher with shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) all rising as optimism around artificial intelligence crept back in. Investors have been debating what role the "Magnificent Seven" stocks will play in powering markets in 2025 after their massive outperformance last year. But Tesla (TSLA) shares slid almost 6% after the electric vehicle maker posted its first decline in annual deliveries on Thursday morning. Also in focus was news that a Cybertruck loaded with firework mortars and fuel canisters exploded in Las Vegas on Wednesday, killing one person. The FBI is investigating whether the blast outside the Trump International Hotel was an act of terrorism. Over the holiday week, US mortgage rates rose to 6.97% to reach the highest level since early July, data showed. The gain weighed on applications for home purchases and dented refinancing, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Weekly jobless claims fell to their lowest level since March. Data released by the Department of Labor on Thursday morning showed claims of 211,000, a decrease from the previous week's upwardly revised level of 220,000. On the corporate front, Apple (AAPL) shares fell around 2% after the iPhone maker offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, reflecting rising competition from local handset makers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) erased early morning gains to hover near the flat line by 11:30 a.m. ET on Thursday. A fall in shares of Boeing (BA) weighed on the blue-chip index. The industrial giant's stock dropped as much as 3.5% following Sunday's deadly crash of a 737-800 aircraft operated by Jeju Air in South Korea. Analysts were however quick to point out it's unlikely that the incident was related to Boeing's production challenges last year. Apple (AAPL) shares fell to session lows after the iPhone maker offered rare discounts on its latest devices in China. A man alleged to be linked to the explosion of a Tesla (TSLA) Cybertruck filled with fireworks and gasoline in Las Vegas was a US soldier, according to a report from CNN. "The man connected to the rental of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside of the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday is a US Special Forces soldier assigned to 10th Special Forces Group, per 4 US officials," CNN correspondent Natasha Bertrand wrote on X. "The man is a US Army special forces operations sergeant, holding the rank of master sergeant, a senior enlisted rank, the officials said. Three officials said he was on active duty and was on leave from Germany, where he was serving with 10th Group, at the time of the incident," said the posting. The Cybertruck had been rented on an app called Turo, the same service used to rent the vehicle involved in running over a crowd of people in New Orleans early Wednesday morning. Authorities are investigating whether there is any link between the two incidents. Tesla shares slid almost 6% on Thursday morning after the EV giant posted its first annual delivery decline. The stock is down roughly 18% over the past five trading sessions. Shares of Tesla hit all-time highs in mid-December on the heels of a massive rally following Donald Trump's White House victory in early November. Shares of Cloudflare (NET) jumped more than 5% on Thursday after the cloud platform company received a double upgrade from Goldman Sachs. The analysts said they see a 28% upside for the stock and raised their price target to $140. They upgraded the stock to a Buy from a Sell recommendation. Goldman analysts cited "improving sales and marketing productivity cycle" and "new AI inferencing use cases" AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2% to lead the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) higher on Thursday morning. Other "Magnificent Seven" stocks also helped lift the tech-heavy index, with Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) rising almost 2%. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla (TSLA) pared some of the losses that came after the EV giant posted its first annual decline in deliveries. The stock fell by as much as 6% in early trading. Apple's (AAPL) stock also came off session lows. The iPhone maker has offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, highlighting rising competition from local device makers.

Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped after the electric vehicle giant said it delivered 495,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter of last year, making 2024 the first year of a decline in annual deliveries since 2011, according to Bloomberg data. Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped 3% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle giant said it delivered 495,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2024, bringing total deliveries to roughly 1.79 million for the whole year. Wall Street analysts expected the automaker to deliver roughly 512,300 EVs for the last three months of the year, or about 1.8 million vehicles, In the fourth quarter, Tesla said it produced approximately 459,000 vehicles. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 1% premarket as investors prepared for the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker to release its fourth quarter deliveries Thursday.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks edged higher on Thursday to kick off the first day of trading of the new year as Wall Street returned from holiday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) hovered near the flatline traders returned from Wednesday's holiday shutdown. Markets are eyeing a comeback after a year-end slide to begin the week dented hopes for a "Santa Claus rally." But the decline capped a blowout 2024 for US stocks that saw the S&P 500 (^GSPC) post two years of over-20% gains in a row — something it hasn't achieved in almost three decades. Several Big Tech stocks rose modestly, with shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) all climbing as optimism around artificial intelligence crept back in. Investors have been debating what role the "Magnificent Seven" stocks will play in powering markets in 2025 after their massive outperformance last year. Over the holiday week, US mortgage rates rose to 6.97% to reach the highest level since early July, data showed. The gain weighed on applications for home purchases and dented refinancing, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Weekly jobless claims fell to their lowest level since March. Data released by the Department of Labor on Thursday morning showed claims of 211,000, a decrease from the previous week's upwardly revised level of 220,000. On the corporate front, Apple (AAPL) shares fell 2% after the iPhone maker offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, reflecting rising competition from local handset makers. Meanwhile, Alibaba's (BABA, 9988.HK) stock tipped lower as markets absorbed news the Chinese e-commerce giant will sell its shares in hypermarket chain Sun Art (SURRY, 6808.HK) at a steep discount. Tesla (TSLA) shares slid more than 6% after the release of the company's fourth quarter delivery data by the EV maker. The stock had risen in pre-market after a Cybertruck exploded in Las Vegas on Wednesday, killing its driver. The FBI is investigating whether the blast outside the Trump International Hotel was an act of terrorism. Stocks rose on the first trading day of the new year following a holiday break and a roaring 2024 for the markets.

Title: Why it seems like all of America’s chains are closing | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The retail store apocalypse stormed back in 2024. Major US retailers announced more than 7,300 store closures last year, up 57% from 2023, according to Coresight Research. That’s the highest annual number of closed stores since 2020, when the pandemic led to mass disruption of businesses across the country. Some of the most recognizable chains in America left strip malls and shuttered across city street corners. Family Dollar closed 718 stores. CVS and Walgreens closed more than 1,000 stores combined. Big Lots closed nearly 600. LL Flooring disappeared for good, and Party City’s liquidation is under way. The Container Store filed for bankruptcy and may be forced to close some of its 100 stores. Restaurant chains also shrank last year. Institutions like Red Lobster and TGI Fridays filed for bankruptcy and Denny’s and Applebee’s announced major closings. There’s no single reason why all of these chains closed last year. But they have a few factors in common: They each were hurt by the highest inflation in 40 years and faced competition from bigger and better-positioned rivals. Many also made strategic mistakes like overexpanding or were slow to pivot to online shopping. “Price-sensitive consumers are looking for the best prices and finding them online,” said Deborah Weinswig, chief executive at Coresight Research. “They have also lost patience with stores that are hard to shop, have out-of-stock items all the time, poor customer service and other issues, and they’re deciding to shop elsewhere.” Closures accelerated because the retail sector’s 2020-2022 sugar high ran out. In the early years of the pandemic, consumers snapped up new couches, televisions and clothing. But companies raised prices higher than many consumers could afford and interest rates soared, making it more expensive to borrow money for big-ticket items or to get a mortgage or a car loan. Consumers reached their breaking point and stopped buying items they didn’t absolutely need, hurting these retailers. Competition from juggernauts like Amazon, Walmart, Costco, Home Depot and Temu also squeezed mid-sized chains like Family Dollar and Big Lots. Bigger chains can buy larger quantities of goods at a steeper discount than smaller players, and they can put vast sums of money into technology and store improvements that even medium-sized retailers can’t afford. The rise in store closures this year harkens back to the days prior to the pandemic, when retailers were closing thousands of stores a year as online shopping grew rapidly. Online sales grew from roughly 6% of all retail sales in 2014 to 12% by the beginning of 2020. This year, online retail made up around 16% of total sales. In 2017 and 2018, retailers closed a combined 13,400 stores, according to Coresight. In 2019 alone, retailers closed a record 9,800 stores. Payless, Gymboree, Charlotte Russe and Shopko all filed for bankruptcy that year. The beginning of the pandemic in 2020 flushed out some of the remaining weakest chains like Sears, JCPenney, Pier 1 and others that filed for bankruptcy and closed stores. Around 9,700 stores closed in 2020, according to Coresight. Retailers that made it through got a boost in 2021 and 2022 from extra federal stimulus payments and “revenge spending” among consumers eager to shop after being stuck at home. But this turned out to be a blip, rather than a permanent improvement. Chains that were struggling before the pandemic are once again faltering as high interest rates drive up debt payments and price hikes weigh on many consumers. Inflation is getting back to normal, but prices overall are still up around 20% from 2020. Surging rates mean people are paying more for their cars, their homes and their credit cards every month, so there’s less money to go around for other things — even as Americans’ paychecks got fatter this year. The Container Store is a prime example of a company falling back to earth after surging post-pandemic. It boomed in 2021, when consumers stuck inside their homes at the peak of the pandemic drove record sales and profit at the company. But the Container Store proved vulnerable to changes in the housing market. Mortgage rates hit two-decade highs near 8% last year and are still hovering close to 7%. High interest rates have kept many people from buying or selling their homes, and the frozen housing market has spilled over to hurt the Container Store. Consumers hunting for bargains and dialing back discretionary purchases after years of companies raising prices also pressured the Container Store. Its core middle-income shoppers are looking for discounts and turned their backs on the store’s big profit engines, including consultations and premium services. Even more affluent shoppers are curtailing their spending and switching to chains that offer lower-priced products. The Container Store filed for bankruptcy days before Christmas. Smaller discount retailers that cater to lower and middle-income shoppers were also squeezed out. Family Dollar hit trouble as its core low-income customers struggled to afford basic necessities and dialed back their spending or switched to Walmart — where they were already buying all the rest of their stuff, including groceries (Walmart is America’s largest food seller). Other discount chains faced similar challenges: Big Lots filed for bankruptcy in September and has closed hundreds of stores. The company reached a last-minute agreement to keep its remaining 900 stores open. 99 Cents Only went out of business permanently and closed 371 stores. Drug store chains are also shrinking. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid have announced more than closures this year combined, according to Coresight. These chains overexpanded during the 1990s and 2000s to drive out competitors and draw more customers, but they weren’t able to foresee vastly lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs on the horizon; nor that Amazon, Walmart and others would chip away at the snacks and household staple sales that the front end of their stores relied on. “Retailers who were either financially flawed, undifferentiated or who forgot how to serve customers struggled,” said Greg Portell, a senior partner at consulting firm Kearney. Many of these trends will continue in 2025, especially if President-elect Donald Trump implements sweeping tariffs. Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% tariffs on goods coming from China. Tariffs are taxes placed on imported goods designed to protect domestic manufacturers. Companies that import products pay the taxes and typically pass on the extra cost to customers in the form of higher prices. “Retailers should expect continued degradation of the middle market,” said Portell. It’s not the end of retail as we know it, however. Successful chains will be suitors for vacant retail and restaurant space. Major chains announced nearly 6,000 store openings last year, a 6.5% increase from 2023. Many companies opening stores are targeting bargain hunters. Related article Chili’s is America’s unlikeliest restaurant comeback story German discount grocer Aldi announced plans last year to open 126 new stores nationwide in a larger $9 billion expansion strategy to reach shoppers looking for cheap groceries. Discount clothing stores like TJ Maxx, Burlington and Ross Stores are growing. These chains have pressured department stores like Macy’s and Kohl’s in recent years by offering designer brands for lower prices. TJX, the parent company of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, announced 99 store openings last year. Burlington announced 140 openings. And Ross opened 89. Companies and economists warn that President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to slap tariffs on all US imports will cause havoc in supply chains and raise prices for customers. But TJX has said it believes that Trump’s planned tariffs will create more opportunities for the company to scoop up cheap designer goods as companies race to bring in products early to avoid tariffs. TJX said that the “chaos” Trump’s tariffs may bring to the retail industry plays right into its business model. “Manufacturers could bring in goods early,” TJX CEO Ernie Herrman said on an earnings call with analysts in November. “That could create even additional availability of goods at advantageous prices for us.” Other retailers have also made unlikely comebacks and are opening stores again. Barnes & Noble opened 60 stores last year as consumers showed affinity for buying books from physical bookstores. J.Crew, which filed for bankruptcy in 2020, opened 34 stores last year and brought back its catalog. J. Crew has tapped into Millennials’ nostalgia for the brand and attracted younger Gen Z shoppers. So the retail apocalypse may be back on — but smart brands have figured out how to make brick and mortar cool again.

January 02, 2025 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Jan. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ today announced distributions for the YieldMax™ ETFs listed in the table below. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs.” You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about each Fund, visit our website at www.YieldMaxETFs.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs. ZEGA Financial is the sub-adviser for all YieldMax™ETFs other than FEAT and FIVY. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX, YMAG, FEAT and FIVY generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: Bank Of America Expects Its “Sector Top Pick” NVIDIA To Officially Announce Its Entry In The AI PC Market At The Upcoming CES

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA stole the proverbial show in 2024, sometimes going so far as to cushion the entire market via the relentless rise in its market capitalization. Now, it seems that the GPU maker is on course to repeat the stellar notes of its 2024 performance, as per the tidbits that can be gleaned from the latest investment note penned by Bank of America (BofA) analyst Vivek Arya. To wit, while conceding that the broader overtones of NVIDIA's keynote address at the upcoming CES are already known, Arya asserts that the tradeshow still remains a positive catalyst for the GPU manufacturer's shares: "While the big themes have already been mentioned in the media ahead of the event, we still see CES as a positive catalyst, re-asserting NVDA’s platform dominance/opportunity in high-growth markets." At the upcoming CES tradeshow, Arya expects NVIDIA to provide critical updates on its overarching robotics strategy and the Jetson Thor platform for humanoid robots, which aligns with the emerging theme around "physical AI." The BofA analyst also expects NVIDIA to launch RTX 50xx - the PC gaming variants of its Blackwell GPUs that are expected to boast of "enhanced 'neural rendering' and faster GDDR7 memory." Moreover, Arya expects NVIDIA to provide another update on its data center/AI GPU lineup, "incl. current-gen Blackwell (GB200, B200), 2H upgraded variants (GB300, B300 – more memory (288GB using 12 stack High HBM 3E) for more accurate AI inference) and teaser on next-gen Rubin (CY26E)." Finally, and perhaps most critically, Arya is looking for NVIDIA's official entry in the "AI PC [market] likely via partnership or (small) chance of standalone PC CPU." This aligns with a separate note recently penned by Truist Securities analyst Will Stein, wherein he announced: "We believe NVDA will announce a client-side CPU during 2025, opening up an additional ~$35B TAM." Coming back, in light of the anticipated developments at the CES, Arya has reiterated a 'Buy' rating on NVIDIA shares with a $190 stock price target: "Reiterate Buy on our sector top pick, Nvidia , ahead of CES tradeshow that starts Jan-6 with keynote and other events featuring NVDA CEO." For reference, NVIDIA is currently trading at the $135 price handle in today's pre-market trading. This corresponds to a ~40 percent upside potential relative to Arya's stated target price for the GPU manufacturer's shares. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Weight loss drugs are changing the game, Eli Lilly exec says — but many still can't get them
URL: https://qz.com/zepbound-weight-loss-drugs-eli-lilly-patrik-jonsson-1851721253
Time Published: 2025-01-02T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Obesity is a major global health crisis, especially in the United States, but newer weight-loss drugs like Eli Lilly’s (LLY+0.64%) Zepbound could offer a long-awaited solution — if they become more accessible. Worldwide, obesity rates among adults have more than doubled since 1990, with over 1 billion people — one in eight globally — classified as obese in 2022, according to the World Health Organization. In the U.S., the numbers are even starker with 40% of American adults being considered obese. It’s no wonder then that a newer class of highly-effective weight-loss drugs, known commonly as GLP-1 or incretin treatments have taken the country by storm. Analysts at Morgan Stanley (MS+0.65%) project that the global market for these weight-loss drugs could reach $105 billion by 2030. In the U.S. alone, adoption is expected to grow to 31.5 million people — approximately 9% of the population — by 2035. The growing use of these drugs could be a “game changer” for long-term healthcare outcomes and costs, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health Patrik Jonsson told Quartz in an interview. However, due to their high-price and lack of widespread insurance coverage, these medications remain inaccessible to many patients. “Obesity is a chronic disease with more than 200 downstream indications,” Jonsson said. “I can’t think of any other chronic disease that is not covered in insurance plans outside of obesity.” Jonsson began leading the company’s most lucrative division this January. He now oversees Eli Lilly’s pipeline of incretin medications, including its blockbuster weight-loss drug Zepbound. Zepbound belongs to the incretin class medications, which was made popular by Ozempic, Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment. These drugs mimic hormones that reduce appetite and regulate blood sugar. Demand for these medications have transformed Novo Nordisk (NVO+0.30%) and Eli Lilly into the largest pharma companies in the world. Now, recent studies and clinical trials have found that these drugs also have health benefits beyond weight loss, potentially paving the way for broader insurance coverage and thus wider-access. Earlier this year, Eli Lilly published results of a study that found that the drug behind Zepbound was found to help nearly eliminate the risk of diabetes for adults who are pre-diabetic and are overweight or obese. The drug was tested on over 1,000 adults over the course of three years who had pre-diabetes and were overweight or obese. Patients who took weekly doses of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, reduced their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 94%, compared to patients who were on a placebo. “What does it mean if we prevent diabetes or at a minimum delay the onset of action with three, five, ten years? The impact on humanity is significant,” Jonsson said of the potential implications of the study. Additionally, the company announced results of trials that showed the drug could help with other conditions like heart failure. Its competitor Novo Nordisk has also explored additional medical uses for its incretin medications, such as treating chronic kidney disease. Jonsson said this growing bank of evidence “underscores the value of treating obesity.” This year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Novo Nordisk’s weight-loss drug Wegovy for reducing the risk of serious cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes. As a result, Medicare began covering the drug. Medicare is currently only allowed to cover these medications for weight loss if they are prescribed to treat a second condition as well. And in December, the FDA approved Zepbound as the first prescription drug to help alleviate moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) for adults with obesity, opening the door for Medicare to cover the drug. President Joe Biden is now trying to expand access to pricey blockbuster drugs in his final months in office. The Biden-Harris administration proposed a new rule on in November that would expand coverage of the anti-obesity medications for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The proposal must still undergo the formal rule-making process, which could take several months, and would require endorsement from President-elect Donald Trump to be implemented. This complicates the issue since Trump has named Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as his choice to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Kennedy has previously come out more strongly against the growing use of these drugs. Instead, he has repeatedly promoted healthy eating as a solution to the country’s obesity epidemic. Jonsson rejected the notion that diet and exercise alone could solve the obesity crisis. “In all the clinical trials, not just for Lilly, but I think for most of our competitors as well, there is a placebo arm that includes diet and exercise,” Jonsson said. “So, diet and exercise are regularly checked in placebo-controlled trials. And it’s not sufficient. It’s never even close to making a significant difference.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Mr Price Group Limited (JSE:MRP) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 54%

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significantly high institutional ownership implies Mr Price Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions 50% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business A look at the shareholders of Mr Price Group Limited (JSE:MRP) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 54% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Mr Price Group. View our latest analysis for Mr Price Group Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. Mr Price Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Mr Price Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Mr Price Group is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Public Investment Corporation Limited is the largest shareholder with 17% of shares outstanding. With 10% and 3.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, Ninety One UK Limited and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Additionally, the company's CEO Mark Blair directly holds 0.5% of the total shares outstanding. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that Mr Price Group Limited insiders own under 1% of the company. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own R596m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 43% stake in Mr Price Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Mr Price Group better, we need to consider many other factors. I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.

Title: Five Top Tech Stocks Of 2024: Year In Review
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2025/01/01/five-top-tech-stocks-of-2024-year-in-review/
Time Published: 2025-01-01T23:21:45Z

The Nasdaq 100 capped off 2024 with a return of 24.9%, building upon 2023’s 53.8% return (its best year since 1999). Since the start of 2023, the Nasdaq 100 has nearly doubled with stellar returns of 84.5%, its second highest two year performance since 1998 and 1999’s 274.2% rise. This year, the Nasdaq had countless winners and strong repeat performances from AI leaders like Nvidia, but 5 stocks took the market by surprise with significant outperformance relative to the broader indices. I think it’s important to pause and draw some parallels around the stocks that performed well in 2024 to form an opinion on what might perform well in 2025, as many of the year’s top performers shared similar fundamental improvements or had similar thematic tailwinds such as AI, nuclear and quantum computing. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 21: Reddit CEO Steve Huffman stands on the floor of the New York Stock ... [+] Exchange (NYSE) while ringing a bell on the floor setting the share price at $47 in its initial public offering (IPO) on March 21, 2024 in New York City. The social media platform Reddit had priced its IPO in the range of $31 to $34 per share on Wednesday. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Below, I review five of the top stocks of 2024, selected based on their price action, fundamentals and presence withing leading tech themes. Choosing a top 5 means many great stocks were left off this list, yet this sample helps to form conclusions around how 2024 shaped up versus years past, centered around leading, core thematic opportunities. Read about our Top 5 Stocks from 2023 here and our Top 5 Stocks from 2022 here – many of which went on to lead the following years. AppLovin was one of the Nasdaq’s best performers, up 735% and joining the Nasdaq 100 on a special rebalance in November. From the start of 2024, AppLovin rose from a mere $13 billion valuation to $111 billion, peaking above $135 billion in early December – the stock has done the unthinkable this year, awakening a low-growth mobile gaming ads industry with an AI engine that is showing demonstrable results. This meteoric rise stems from APP’s AXON 2.0 AI advertising engine, which has driven significant revenue acceleration and massive fundamental improvements to margins and cash flow. AppLovin has reported four consecutive quarters with revenue growth above 30% YoY, a major acceleration from late 2022 and late 2023 where three of four quarters saw declining revenues. Management expressed confidence in maintaining 20% to 30% YoY growth for the foreseeable future due to the efficiencies of AXON’s self-learning and catalysts from web-based e-commerce expansion. AppLovin has reported four consecutive quarters with revenue growth above 30% YoY, a major ... [+] acceleration from late 2022 and late 2023. Not only has revenue accelerated substantially, but AppLovin’s margins have more than doubled further down the income statement. GAAP gross margin expanded more than 8 points to 77.5% in Q3, while operating margin rose more than 13 points to 44.6%. Taking a look annually, AppLovin is on track to potentially double its operating margin to ~38% from 19.7% in FY23. Additionally, net margin nearly tripled to 36% in Q3 on a GAAP basis, up from 13% a year ago. EPS rose 317% YoY to $1.25, with YTD EPS reaching $2.81, up 462% YoY. AppLovin is on track to potentially double its operating margin to ~38% from 19.7% in FY23. AppLovin’s near-flawless execution has also translated to strong cash flow generation, with operating cash flow margin doubling, rising from 23% a year ago to 46% in Q3. Free cash flow margin followed, reaching 45.5%, up from 22% a year ago. This kind of operating leverage while maintaining revenue growth rates in the 30% range is quite rare indeed, separating AppLovin from a majority of its ad-tech and software peers. Analysts are excited to see what the company’s expansion to e-commerce can contribute to growth and a path to $6+ in EPS next year from AppLovin’s very strong margin profile. Palantir joins this Top 5 list for a second-year running, with shares rising 356%. My firm’s free stock newsletter previously pointed out that Palantir was “one of the rare few that sees AI drive both real returns for its business and real value for its customers,” as it continues to crush its software competitors in AI-related growth. Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has driven a significant revenue re-acceleration following its launch, with profitability also expanding – a rare combination for growth software stocks. Palantir has capitalized on the AI software opportunity at hand via AIP’s unique value proposition, its scalability and versatility. November and December’s partnership announcements alone help demonstrate the versatility of Palantir’s platform, spanning numerous different industries from autonomous drone navigation to AI models for defense tech to more government program wins. Palantir benefits from the best of both worlds in both government contracts and AI exposure, as enterprise adoption of AI builds. For a deeper look at AIP and how it has been transforming Palantir and driving revenue growth higher, read This Stock Is Crushing Salesforce, MongoDB And Snowflake In AI Revenue. Palantir’s 2024 was characterized by strong underlying AI momentum, with Q3 seeing revenue growth reach 30%, more than 10 points faster than when it entered the year and nearly 5 points above guidance for 25.2% growth. AIP has aided this revenue acceleration story by driving significant growth in Palantir’s US commercial segment, with the past two quarters seeing growth there above 50% YoY. Palantir’s 2024 was characterized by strong underlying AI momentum, with Q3 seeing revenue growth ... [+] reach 30%, more than 10 points faster than when it entered the year. Similar to AppLovin, these AI growth tailwinds are not just driving revenue, but also aiding operating margin expansion and EPS growth. GAAP operating margin was 16% for the second quarter in a row, up 9 points from last year, while adjusted operating margin is approaching 40% and has been >30% for four quarters in a row. Cash flow margins have been strong — operating cash flow was nearly $420 million, or a 58% margin, while adjusted free cash flow was $435 million, a 60% margin in Q3, up from the low-20% range in the first half of 2024. Palantir is targeting adjusted FCF of $1 billion-plus this year, or ~36% of revenue. Fundamentally, to have revenue growth around 30%, free cash flow margin of 30%, and adjusted operating margin nearing 40% is impressive, to say the least. Palantir’s returns this year reflect that fundamental strength from AI-driven growth as well as optimism about its AI growth prospects for next year. Quantum computing stocks have been on a tear to end the year, with a handful of names seeing returns of more than 2,000% over the past three months. IonQ has risen 244% on surging enthusiasm for the quantum computing sector and revenue reaccelerating 40 percentage points over the past three quarters. IonQ reported $12.4 million in revenue in Q3, with revenue growth of 102% YoY, following on 106% YoY growth in Q2. This has accelerated 42 points from 60% YoY growth in Q4, as IonQ is starting to quickly scale revenues as it has been consistently delivering on its technical roadmap ahead of schedule. IonQ also slightly raised its full year revenue guidance to $40.5 million at midpoint, for growth of 84% YoY. As it is still in its scaling phase, IonQ is by no means profitable or close to profitability, with analysts not expecting the quantum computing firm to break into profitability until well after 2027. However, revenue is currently expected to grow at a ~95% CAGR through 2027, from $22 million last year to an estimated $315 million. IonQ's revenue is currently expected to grow at a ~95% CAGR through 2027, from $22 million last year ... [+] to an estimated $315 million. This positioning in a leading theme among investors in the second half of 2024, as well as consistent execution ahead of schedule with revenue growth forecast to rise at a nearly triple digit CAGR through 2027 has landed IonQ a spot on this list. Despite not even trading for the entire year with its IPO in March, Reddit has returned a remarkable 224% from its first day close of $50.44. The social media and online community platform reported a blowout beat and raise in Q3, with investors eyeing some AI training data opportunities ($60M/year deal with Google) on top of strong advertising growth. Q3 revenue rose 68% YoY to $348 million, a 14 point acceleration from 54% YoY growth in Q2 and up 20 points from 48% YoY growth in Q1. Advertising revenue growth accelerated 15 points sequentially, rising 56% YoY to $315 million. Q4’s guide for $385 million to $400 million in revenue came in well above the $361 million consensus estimate, pointing to growth of 57% YoY. The market is expecting another blowout in Q4, with analysts already projecting $403 million in revenue, above the high end of management’s guided range. Reddit's Q3 revenue rose 68% YoY to $348 million, a 14 point acceleration from 54% YoY growth in Q2 ... [+] and up 20 points from 48% YoY growth in Q1 Reddit is demonstrating significant operating leverage, as it surprised the Street by reporting GAAP net income in the high single-digit percents in the quarter. GAAP operating expenses rose 53% YoY, less than that 68% YoY revenue growth, pushing GAAP operating margin to 8.6%, up from (3.4%) a year ago and (3.7%) in Q2. Cash flow generation has improved, with Reddit generating $71.6 million in operating cash flow and $70.3 million in free cash flow in Q3, or margins of ~20%. This doubled from ~10% cash flow margins in Q2. Adjusted EBITDA has increased more than 9x from the start of the year, at $94.4 million in Q3, a 27% margin, up from just $10.0 million in Q1. Reddit excites the market due to its fundamentals — a 90% gross margin business quickly shifting to GAAP profitability on rapid quarterly revenue growth. This combination hints at potentially strong EPS growth, should it scale from the single-digit net margin range of 8.6% in Q3, to the double-digit range in short time. Though Nvidia arguably deserves a spot on this Top 5 list with a 114% gain following Hopper’s breakout 2023, with data center revenue continuing to beat estimates by $1 billion each quarter, I think it’s time to highlight an Nvidia supplier and ASICs beneficiary – Astera Labs. Astera returned 179% in Q4 for a total YTD gain of 128%, with the company showing multiple growth opportunities and a push for profitability despite still solidly being in its hypergrowth phase. Astera is a major supplier to Nvidia’s PCIe-enabled GPUs with PCIe5 retimers and components, and its upcoming Scorpio fabric switches built on its lead in PCIe5. Management expects the new product to “exceed 10% of revenues in 2025” with “good momentum going into 2026” as it unlocks a $12 billion TAM by 2028. Astera reported record revenue of $113.1 million in Q3, up 47% QoQ and 206% YoY, beating estimates by 16.1%. Management guided for $126 million to $130 million in revenue in Q4, well ahead of the $108 million consensus estimate and representing YoY growth of 153%, its fifth consecutive triple-digit growth rate. Astera Labs reported 206% YoY revenue growth in Q3 and guided for 153% YoY growth in Q4, its fifth ... [+] consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. Even with revenue growth expected to be triple-digits for at least the next two quarters, management forecast for GAAP net income in Q4, though at a razor thin margin. GAAP operating margin is moving towards positive territory, from (7.9%) in Q3 to (4.3%) at midpoint of Q4’s guide. Adjusted operating margin expanded significantly to above 32% in Q3, up from 2% a year ago, while adjusted net margin improved 35.6% compared to (-1.1%) last year. Astera was one of a handful of AI-exposed semiconductors to see dazzling returns this year, as AI semiconductors remained investor favorites throughout the year. Astera also shared key similarities to the rest of this list: adjusted margins showing strong expansion, high cash flow margins (56% operating cash flow margin in Q3), and AI-related rapid revenue growth. For a more detailed look at Astera’s product lines, Blackwell and ASICs opportunities and its AI-driven TAM growth, read more here. If there’s one major takeaway from this selection of 2024’s top tech stocks, it’s that being at the top comes with quite the price tag and premium. All five of these stocks trade at quite high multiples, headlined by IonQ at 230x forward revenue and Palantir at a 2021-esque 63x forward revenue and 32x 2027 revenue. Astera Labs trades at 53x forward revenue, while AppLovin and Reddit are not quite as high, at 24x and 22x respectively. However, these revenue multiples are all 130% to 500% higher than they were six months ago, highlighting just how quickly these five have gotten more expensive as they’ve rallied. All five of these stocks trade at quite high multiples, headlined by IonQ at 230x forward revenue ... [+] and Palantir at a 2021-esque 63x forward revenue and 32x 2027 revenue. Looking back at 2024 can be important as it often provides clues for tech investors as the new year begins. Winners have kept winning, from Nvidia to the five discussed here, and that is one reason I like to reflect on the clear winners from the previous year. These five stocks above highlighted similarities among winning tech stocks in 2024 – presence and prevalence in leading themes such as AI and quantum computing, strong revenue acceleration (and rapid growth), and operating leverage driving margin expansion. For 2025, the I/O Fund has worked to identify key Nvidia suppliers with Blackwell on deck to ramp significantly, sharing this research and buy zones with premium members.

Title: Stocks surged in 2024 even as Americans fretted over US economy

Returns from the tech-focused Nasdaq have frequently been impressive. Photo / Getty Images If you invested in the stock market in 2024, chances are you came out pretty well. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite index rose to record highs, as investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence fueled a massive bull run, and investors cheered the Federal Reserve’s shift to lower interest rates. Participants in 401(k) and 403(b) plans also benefited big, with Fidelity Investments reporting that account balances reached their highest averages on record. The stock market soared despite Americans’ widespread discontent with the economy, highlighting a disconnect between the experiences of many US households and the performance of their investments. US markets outperformed those in Europe and Asia: The S&P 500 gained 23% this year, while the Shanghai Composite Index rose 13%, and the STOXX Europe 600 moved up 6%, earlier this week. The strong performance also came amid expectations of an economic slowdown in 2024. “There were real concerns over the summer about whether we were once again heading for a hard landing and/or a recession,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. But in a way, those fears came at a good time, Bespoke Investment co-founder Paul Hickey said, because it helped push the Fed to ease monetary policy. “It almost panicked the Fed into cutting 50 basis points at its annual meeting” in September, Hickey said. Markets rallied further late in 2024, fuelled by what analysts say was exuberance over the election of Donald Trump to a second presidential term. The president-elect punctuated the “Trump trade” when he rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange in December, though stocks fell days later on signals that the Fed, rather than cutting interest rates further, planned to leave them at their current level for longer than many observers had expected. Here are the highlights of a momentous year in stocks. The S&P 500′s record gains in the first half of 2024 were driven by seven tech stocks that significantly outperformed the other companies on the index. The “Magnificent Seven” - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla - have an outsize effect on the S&P 500 because the index is weighted by market capitalisation, a shorthand for companies’ size and value. The rest of the index started to catch up in the latter half of the year, a rally that showed “it’s not just seven companies driving the entire economy,” Hickey said. But the technology and AI sectors continued to dominate investors’ attention. And no stock captured their enthusiasm like AI chipmaker Nvidia, whose earnings calls have inspired rapturous takes from traders and casual investors alike. “Every bull market has a theme, and the theme of this bull market has been AI,” Hickey said. Chris Rupkey, with Fwdbonds, said Nvidia’s juggernaut status has made it something of a bellwether for the broader market. “Follow the bouncing ball of Nvidia,” he said in August. “Nvidia down, sell everything. Nvidia up, buy it all.” Nvidia’s growth has slowed in recent months and its stock has taken temporary hits after strong earnings reports, as analysts set exceedingly hard-to-meet expectations and some raise concerns that rampant spending on AI is creating a financial bubble. But some analysts say Nvidia will have staying power and catalyse further investment in AI. “This is the fourth industrial revolution playing out across tech,” said Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. “It’s led by Mag 7, but now software and cybersecurity players are getting in.” US stocks dipped, then surged, after the Fed cut interest rates by a half-percentage point in September, easing monetary policy for the first time since March 2020 amid signs that inflation was moderating. That, in turn, boosted consumer sentiment and took the edge off interest rates. “A funny thing kind of happened on the way to the recession and or economic slowdown that we all anticipated, which is basically that the [middle- and high-income] consumer just never flinched,” Samana said. US stocks jumped on the news that Trump would return to the White House after campaigning on promises to slash regulations. Companies expected to benefit under the Trump administration - such as private prison company Geo Group and Tesla, which is led by Trump adviser Elon Musk - leaped while renewable energy and pharmaceutical stocks sank in the immediate aftermath. But Hickey said the conventional wisdom about winners and losers in the market doesn’t always pan out when it comes to politics. “Coming into the first Trump administration, you would have thought the energy sector would have done well,” he said. “It was the worst performing sector.” Looking ahead, Hickey expects the industrial sector will perform well in 2025, especially if loosened regulations help lingering construction projects break ground - such as renewable energy proposals green-lit by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. “Whether it was Trump or Biden that was elected president, the overall trend in the economy is to bring more production back to the United States,” Hickey said. The biggest wild card going into 2025 is tariffs, said David Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar. Trump has said he intends to impose a blanket tariffs on imports, but it’s unclear what countries or sectors would be covered and how much of the promise is campaign rhetoric. Bitcoin had a massive year - and that was especially reflected in the share price of MicroStrategy, a business software company that has snapped up several billions of dollars in bitcoin. The company’s stock is up more than 340% year to date, with much of those gains coming after the presidential election. Bitcoin itself began the year with a massive boost, as the Securities and Exchange Commission approved exchange-traded funds tied to the price of bitcoin. In the following months, bitcoin’s price nearly doubled, from around US$40,000 per coin in January to about US$73,000 per coin in March. The price largely held steady until Trump was elected to a second term. After the November election, bitcoin’s price soared and at one point surpassed US$100,000 per coin, a milestone cheered by the cryptocurrency community. The first and most valuable cryptocurrency is up more than 120%. . While Magnificent Seven stocks received big publicity this year, a few lesser-known companies dwarfed their gains - at least when it came to growth. Sezzle, a “buy now, pay later” company, is up more than 1000% on the year, with much of its gains coming after the November election, though some of those gains were wiped out in December when an activist short-selling firm released a report accusing the company of risky lending practices. Shares in NuScale Power, a nuclear power company focused on small modular reactors, is up more than 450% on the year. The rise reflects investor excitement over the transition to low-carbon energy sources, particularly new technologies such as NuScale’s designs. AppLovin, a mobile app development and marketing company, also had a banner year on Wall Street, with the companies’ shares up more than 700% on the year. Analysts say the company has been able to wield AI to more effectively market apps. It was a soft start to the year on worries about higher bond rates.

Title: Wishes for 2025 on the Edge of the Abyss

Welcome to the new year! Remember last year when I said things were going to be bad in 2024? Probably not, but I have the link here. In hindsight, I didn’t really allow for how much of that would spill into 2025. Also, a year ago I really meant being constantly bombarded by all the election nonsense. I kind of thought the country would make a better choice after that. I thought it would be temporary nonsense. But no, we have chosen chaos. We have chosen a game show reality TV government because… well, we’re dumb… or willfully ignorant… or masters of self-deception. I mean sure, some out there clearly thought sowing the wind sounded really cool and supported sowing in an unabashed, full throated way, pouring billions of dollars into the “pro-sow” candidates. And now we will spend our time reaping the whirlwind thanks in part to them. But the result was mostly due to people being incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions. So shall it be, the people have spoken. The Year is 2025 So here we are on the first day of 2025 and… do I really want to do predictions? On the one hand, there is a bit of a tradition to maintain at this point. I mean, look at this record: That is a 17 year streak and I am not about to break that because the world is going to shit… or at least more so than usual. On the other hand, you can see that I don’t have to do predictions every year. I mean, if you dig into those years when it is something like “Questions,” they really could be seen as predictions. But they are also different in tone and a bit liberating because you don’t have to focus on a goal, just a possible topic. Predictions for 2025 feel like they will just get too dark too quickly given my current mood. Likewise, even questions for the new year ran pretty dark when I started sorting some out in my head. So this year I am going to do wishes. Video game wishes. Let’s keep this manageable. You can wish for world peace on your own time. I am going to list out video game things I want to happen, things I hope will happen, things that might make things better, all in an unsubtle attempt to try and mine some optimism. We shall see. This is something of a turn around as I usually have to state clearly that just because I predict something doesn’t mean I want it to happen. Now I get to run with things I actually want to happen. I will state up front I won’t be wishing for anything bad to happen. No bad mojo. I will also endeavor to not be completely sarcastic or passive aggressive in my wishes…. but you know that is going to slip, right? Look, I am influenced by the world around me… and have you seen this place lately? So cut me some slack. There might be a barb or two in there, but I want my intentions to be clear and in the right place. And if my wishes don’t come true… well, that isn’t on ME now is it? I guess. Better wait until we see what I wish for. But I am going to be leaning heavily on the cosmos and the goodness of people to make this stuff come true. What I have I got then? What am I wishing for? 1 – An End to Video Game Industry Consolidation and Mass Layoffs Why start small, right? If you got wishes, throw them at a big problem. Unfortunately that lamp I was rubbing the other day… I hope that was a lamp… didn’t promise me anything. And an “end” might be too big of an ask. I would consider the wish fulfilled if we could at least see the industry cycle into a hiring phase and maybe hold of with the acquisition slash and burn to make the line go up a tiny fraction this week. I think I am already off to a bad start with a wish where I won’t be able measure. I guess I’ll just listen to video game devs and see what they’re complaining about. 2 – News about the next EverQuest title Just don’t call it EverQuest Next! Man, was that a dumb name. I am pretty sure that was my stance back whenever… but if it wasn’t, let me say that the name has not grown on me in the mean time. Okay, EG7/Daybreak threw the idea out there of a new EverQuest title back in late 2023… and I know some of us would like to hear a bit more about it. There was a hint about it being in the ideation phase, but naught else. And while it was on track for 2028 maybe, I am keen to hear if the ideas for it are still rooted in the whole hardcore, be like Elden Ring thing that Ji Ham was espousing back in 2023. A bit of hope or a nugget to hang on to, but more than just some concept art. Lord knows how that screwed us back in the day. 3 – Happy Annual Expansions at Daybreak Easy one here, a gimme for the universe. Just do the usual Q4 expansions for EQ, EQII, LOTRO, and whatever. Does Palia get an annual update now too? I don’t know. But just carry on. 4 – LOTRO to do Something to Improve Large Monitor Access Look, I don’t need full 4K support. That was always a pipe dream anyway. SSG is fully committed to simply maintaining the status quo and adding a bit of content to the game. The idea, for example, that it was ever going to be ported to consoles was absurd on its face, something I called out when that first came up. EG7 has since said they would rather spend the money on developing a new game… though Daybreak has been pretty shy on actually producing a “new” game so far. That said, there are probably half a dozen things of small to medium-ish effort that SSG could do that would make the game more viable on large screens. They could, as an example, get somebody to redo their bitmap skill icons as SVGs so they will not look like ass when you make the the hotbar bigger. (Also an opportunity to make them distinguishable rather than a bunch of red or green blobs with nonsensical iconography, which is something people were calling out back in 2007.) They could make scaling stick for the whole UI, as it reverts to defaults in an annoying number of places between sessions. And they could work on text and dialogs to make them readable on a 4K monitor… with a universal sizing setting maybe? I find it extremely annoying to have to tinker with every aspect of the UI and then have half of it revert when I log off. So just fix that shit. Put in the effort. Haha, I know. I fully expect this wish to go completely unfulfilled, this is me hoping against hope, but there it is. 5 – Commit to or Let Go Of H1Z1 I know I said no negatives, and I am trying not to go there, but EG7/Daybreak has been living in this delusion for quite a while now where they boost H1Z1 as one of their most important first party franchises at every opportunity while, at the same time, they spend no time or effort on actually doing anything with it. It has basically sat in limbo for since Nantworks gave up and handed the game back to Daybreak, unable to make anything good out of it. And I know they have talked about a new H1Z1 title. That was supposed to be in pre-production in the first half of 2024, which means we should have heard some new by now… and we haven’t. Things don’t always go to plan and that roadmap was pretty squishy, but still… figure it out by the end of 2025; commit or stop pretending it is a thing. 6 – Blizzard to not Mess Up WoW Housing Blizz got a big bounce in hope by announcing that housing was coming to World of Warcraft. The thing they said they would not do, the thing they half-assed as garrisons it what looked like an attempt to prove their point that housing takes people out of the world, the thing that would probably up the long term subscriber retention rate by 5-10% if done right… yeah, do it… and do it right! What does “right” mean? I don’t know. I have a bunch of vague ideas and examples from other titles of things I felt worked and things that I felt did not. But Blizz and its ability to read the room is not something people have come to count on. We won’t actually GET housing in 2025. We know that from the roadmap. But they should be able to give us a substantial view into what they are planning. So that view plus “doesn’t obviously suck” is the bar here. 7 – WoW Classic Progression to Pick Up the Pace I feel that nearly a year of Cataclysm Classic has proven the point that classic progression servers can advance too slowly, and that isn’t going to get any better with some of the coming expansions. Find the right pacing Blizz. Also, this reminds me again that I had better consider how to check to see if my wishes have come true. Do wishes need to be SMART? I might not know if this one was granted in 2025. 8 – Blizz to use all that talent and all those resources to make something new They have the money, they have the staff, they can surely find some new idea out in the industry to steal and re-work. They can’t have lost all their skill in that, can they? What non-Blizz titles do Blizz devs play now? Not all Clash of Clans I hope. That’s it though, isn’t it? They all just play phone games because they’re mostly in their 20s. Well, I can still wish I guess. 9 – Valheim to Exit Early Access I suppose removing the “early access” label from Valheim won’t change anything really. The dirty secret is that early access is your launch and you don’t get another one when you exit. There won’t be a huge spike in sales or a bunch of new press coverage or any magical change to the game when that hits. It will just be “done.” But sometimes “done” is enough. If they deliver the Northlands and wrap up the quest line so that you can finish the game, then that will be good. They could, if they wanted, go all Hello Games and continue to improve it over time, or it could just immediately go into maintenance mode, as so many early access transition titles do, as the team goes off to work on something else. Either way, completion is a nice thing. Maybe it will get some Steam achievements. That might make me go back and play it one more time. Overall though, I have gotten more than my money’s worth out of Valheim. I am done, it can be done. 10 – Light No Fire to go Early Access This is what started my whole survival co-op frenzy this past year. The mention of Hello Games making this stirred me up. I mean, I really want Light No Fire to launch fully formed because, after the evolution of No Man’s Sky into the game it is today, I want their co-op survival title and their take on the genre… even if it will inevitably be controller-centric. I can deal. But I will take a solid early access and go along for the ride. How much different would the No Man’s Sky journey have been if it had been early access for the first two years? Maybe no different… but maybe it would have set expectations that things were going to continue to evolve. 11 – No Man’s Sky to just keep on keeping on While we’re talking about Hello Games, NMS is just a great example of a company committing to a title and just making it better and better over time. They got robbed on the Labor of Love category in the Steam Awards. Only NMS and Stardew Valley really met the criteria of the award. 12 – Dune Awakening to have Learned from Conan Exiles On my list for 2025 is Dune: Awakening. I liked a lot about Conan Exiles, and my hope is that Funcom will have learned from that… I mean, CE has been out more than six years at this point. I hope that journey has informed them and allowed them to do something cool with the Dune universe. Going to be an interesting one to judge whether the wish was granted or not. 13 – GoG.com to Continue Thriving I am not one to care much about the monthly free games from Amazon Prime… like I don’t have enough unplayed games in my Steam library already… but when they offer up a code for GoG.com I grab it wholly on the assumption that GoG gets some payment for it and as the old game underdog I want them to succeed and thrive in a way I can only describe as completely opposite to my feelings for the Epic Game Store. (I will not wish bad things on the EGS in this post, but in my heart I might… mostly because Tim Sweeney is a bad person in the way that most US CEOs are bad people.) 14 – CCP to Finally Do What they Know They Need to do to Fix the New Eden Economy Passive aggressive much? Actually, that assumes they know what they need to do and, given they have spent three years not doing anything of the sort. So maybe I cannot really argue that this assumption is grounded in any sort of reality. But still, these are wishes, so may the universe magic that knowledge into CCP Rattati’s fore brain and force him to look away from EVE Vanguard for long enough to tell somebody to implement it. 15 – CCP to Succeed at Something Besides EVE Online Look, I am not happy with some of their choices. The blockchain game, EVE Frontier, can (and most likely will) die in a fire. I also do not share the CCP management dream of making a first person shooter, lacking faith in their ability to make something both interesting and unique enough to attract an audience outside of the relatively small New Eden user base. I am also not at all keen on them putting the biggest fan of said shooter in charge of the spaceship game. And EVE Galaxy Conquest… whatever. But, it is in the best interest of those of us who still play their one successful title that something else land and become a success, if only to stabilize the company and make Hilmar less keen to steal resources from the game I play to fund his blockchain fantasies. So if something else could succeed that would be great… and no monkey’s paw where the mobile game makes some money so they abandon EVE Online. In fact, let me just make a “no damn monkey’s paw” side rule right here. 16 – CCP to Make a Co-op Space Survival Title These are popular, CCP has some of the ground work done. They have more than 20 years of spaceships and nearly 15 years of FPS work in the bag now, maybe take a different tack and make something more manageable that could find a niche and grow? Just a thought. I’d play that… if it was any good at all. 17 – CCP to make the New Eden Strategy Game I Want Hey, wishes are free so while I’m here I might as well throw out the idea one more time about a space 4x strategy title set in New Eden where you can play as the main empires or as a null sec leader or even one of the pirate factions as scenarios that takes a strategic view of war and conquest in the New Ede star cluster. I don’t care how. License it to Paradox or something. Just do it. I know, the EVE Online IP isn’t at all popular so nobody would actually play it, but just tack a receptive strategy game audience on to the wish and call it done. We have all the wishes baby! 18 – Andrew Groen to get Empires of EVE vol. III Done It is out there. He has announced he is working on the third and final volume of his history of null sec and New Eden. We’re going to hear about World War Bee and the great Siege of 1DQ1-A and Vily’s vendetta and eventually the downfall of The Mittani, which will probably be what brings the story to a close. And… well… I am eager to read it. I know it takes time, but that doesn’t mean I can be as patient as I need to be. 19 – Some Actual War in New Eden Andrew Groen could be tempted into a volume 4 if, you know, we did something interesting. I know, war depends heavily on CCP fixing the economy so alliances are willing to put trillions of ISK on the line. Also, we need something to fight over and CCP’s scarcity plan has backfired completely in that regard. I don’t know. Maybe Gobbins will go on the forums and say “there are no goons” or something. Send Vily back for a rematch. Have Brisc and Merk defect to Fraternity. Let The Initiative start some shit now that they have no blues. Something. 20 – Some Solid Guild Wars 3 News I know, what we heard was a slip, an accident, but that makes it all the more interesting to find out what is really going on. I am also interested to hear what a dozen years of GW2 has taught the ANet team and how an third title might differ from the second. 21 – Enshrouded to Keep on their Roll The end of the year game for us was Enshrouded and Keen Games has done a great job with it so for. I’ll even give them a pass the missing in-game chat. Turns out I can live without it is the rest of the game is this good. And a co-op survival builder doesn’t *need* a done state, but it still feels like we should be progressing towards a final boss to cleanse the world or something. So get us going there, keep expanding, and maybe not so many jumping puzzles. 22 – Keep Extending Stars Reach Playable Worlds still feels like they are a couple years away from Stars Reach being a real, live service game. The big break through was homesteads and 4 hour play tests this year. But there was a lot promised in the design pillars that has yet to see the light of day. Personally, I am waiting for space ships and space travel. So that is my wish I guess, at least get us to space travel in a test galaxy. 23 – Pokemon Go to level 60 I may regret this wish. Also, I don’t want this until the end of 2025 so I have some time left to get to 50. Niantic pretty much has to do this at some point. There is only so much horizontal progress they can try to pile on. Anyway, I would consider this fulfilled if they even announced a plan for a level cap increase in 2025. There are a lot of hardcore fans who have been at level 50 for a long time now. 24 – That Pokemon Black & White Remake It is the next on the list of old Pokemon titles that have not been remade. It might get me to put my Switch Lite back on the charger and play with it now and then. I wasn’t keen on it as a title when it launched, but when I went back and played it on the 3DS one last time to complete all the pre-Switch titles, I found it had quite a bit to recommend it. 25 – Hope for the Hermit Kingdom Unchained I would like to see Unchained Entertainment… once City State Entertainment, but there was a name change due to unstated reasons… shit or get off the pot when it comes to Camelot Unchained. Mark Jacobs and his team have been running a propaganda mill about how wonderful things are and how much progress there has been for a decade now, to the point that I don’t think comparisons with the North Korean Central News Agency are unjust. Of course, I also want to know what horrible stain Marc Andreesen and his tainted, string laden cash has left on the company and the game. There was a promise of some sort of access in late 2025… but there was also a promise of access in 2014, so lies on top of lies seems to be the norm. So, you know, do something already? That is positive, right? 26 – Civilization VII to Not Be a Bloated Train Wreck There is a long standing tradition in the Civ series of shipping something that really requires the next generation of computers to run. Also bugs, crashes, and a game that really doesn’t settle down until we’ve been sold at least one post-launch expansion pack. I’d like a new Civ game… almost as much as I would like Civ II to be brought up to date… but I have also been there since the dawn of the original… roll that ancient magic quote about being there when they were written… and it has always been a bit of a nightmare on launch. So here is hoping that Sid’s likely final launch for the series is smoother than tradition seems to dictate. 27 – Grand Theft Auto VI Launch Look, it felt bad to see GTA V fall off of the Platinum tier on the Best of Steam 2024. I mean, Silver tier? Sure, not bad for an 11 year old game, but that probably also means we need a new version. I might not play it, but I feel like I need a couple more gimme wishes in here or my seasonal depression will really ramp up about 12 months from now. 28 – Fantastic Pixel Castle Early Access Reveal Then there is Greg “Ghostcrawler” Street and his company Fantastic Pixel Castle, which has been working on an MMO for a couple years now, though this might be my first time mentioning it here on the blog. They have some ideas for a new game, which includes private zones for you and your friends and public zones where you can come into conflict with others and a bunch of things, some of which is being play tested now. It is probably as far along as Stars Reach, maybe further, so it won’t launch in 2025 or even go early access in 2025, but if they had a target date for public access to the game along with a lot more information, I’d consider this wish fulfilled. 29 – Wild Card Indie Success Wish Some little indie studio that I have not heard of at the time of this writing will have a big break-out success and live the indie dev dream for a while. For measuring this I will look at the indie bracket nominations of The Game Awards for 2025 and will consider this granted if at least one of the nominated studios was completely unknown to me and yet I recognize the game nominates and has some headlines about its amazing success or something. Work with me on this. I am just going to let this ride until we get to the decision point in December. Why run my wishes any different than my projects at work? 30 – Half-Life 3 Announced for Real Why the hell not? They’re just wishes! Bonus Wishes All wishes are a bonus, that is why they are wishes, right? But in the event that I come up with some additional wish I want to add in, it will be injected here with a time stamp and the cosmos will not be graded down should the wish not be granted. The cosmos will, however, get full credit if the wish is granted. Wish Scoring Dare I score wishes? Like I said, if they don’t come true that is on the cosmos and not me. I am just the wisher, it is up to the wishee to see that wishes come to pass. Is the cosmos going to get pissed if I try to score it? We shall see! That said, some of this still has to play out like predictions. The cosmos will earn 10 points for each wish fulfilled, with partial credit available. Since I am not the one being scored I will tend to be inclined to give the cosmos credit for getting part way there if, say, Civ VII launches as a train wreck but is fixed before summer ends. Just an example. Also, I mentioned SMART above, which stands for “Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, and Time Related,” and you could certainly call me out for some of my wishes not hitting all five. But when it comes to time, if wishes are not fulfilled by December 15, 2025, they will be considered unfulfilled for the purposes of scoring. That is the drop dead date… though if, say, GTA VI launches on December 16th, because it is a Tuesday, then the cosmos will get full credit even if Rockstar will get some dubious looks for such a late in the year launch. The cosmos has 300 points on the table it can earn. We’ll be back in about a year to see how it does for 2025. Off we go. There are consequences to be borne and whirlwinds to be reaped. So that is what I have. What are your happy, positive, maybe slightly passive-aggressive video game wishes for 2025? Did I miss something important? Meanwhile, others have placed stakes in the ground with their own predictions. Here are a few I picked up: Stars Reach is weirdly much further along in development than I imagined it would be and yet wildly far from being anything remotely to close to the game it’s promoted as being. The fact that a game supposedly set in space has no actual space travel is confounding. I really don’t think the current Invisible Elevator To Orbit counts. I hadn’t thought until I read the post what a paradox No Man’s Sky is. These days the received wisdom seems absolutely to be that Early Access is the kiss of death and keeping your powder dry for Full Launch is the only way to go. And yet, as you point out, a premature launch wrecked NMS whereas Early Access could have seen the game lauded almost from the start as an in-development title that was living up to its promise. There would literally not need to be any other differences at all to the pace and content of development other than the labels that were attached to it at certain times. Maybe EA has its benefits after all. Speaking of which, I was waiting for Pantheon to come up in the wish list until it didn’t. Have you checked how EA is going for them? Very well, apparently. A Very Positve Steam rating from more than a thousand reviews and a Currently Playing total that’s still creeping up. I did not expect either of those. Still don’t want to play it but I guess we can wish that the people who do keep on enjoying themselves. LikeLiked by 1 person Like so many things, early access works, except when it doesn’t. You have to have something obviously good for it to work. It is not a shield against criticism. I didn’t have much in the way of thoughts about Pantheon. It does seem to be doing okay, hitting peak concurrent so far today and almost 80% positive reviews. But it also isn’t a buy once title, it is an MMO with a server and staff to maintain. We’ll have to see if what they have so far is enough or if they can grow it. LikeLike Meanwhile, Fantasy Critic just chimed in with this. Did it read my wishes? Fantasy Critic: Half-Life 3 [Available] Just added! Tags: New Game, Unannounced Game Release Date: Unannounced (Estimated) LikeLike The G-Man himself makes me think your Half-Life 3 wish is closer to being true than we might realize: https://x.com/mikeshapiroland/status/1874213952680607922 I don’t care about any cinematic or major announcement. Just let Valve show me a lambda symbol with a 3 on it and I’ll be pumped for *years*. (I mean, this is Valve we’re talking about. They are the only company that makes old-school Blizzard seem fast…) LikeLiked by 1 person My wishes on the computer game front are very modest. 1 – Paradox not to wreck HoI4/Stellaris/EU4 2 – Terra Invicta to continue to be developed. 3 – LOTRO to keep on going 4 – FF14 to remain a generally chill and friendly place, unlike some other fantasy worlds one could mention. For those where I actually have to do something myself: 5 – Complete at least one of the RPGs I love (but where I keep getting distracted) 6 – Complete base Endwalker in FF14 (currently in Shadowbringers, but I dawdle) 7 – Complete a play through on at least one currently unplayed game in my Steam Library. We shall see LikeLiked by 1 person I also really hope GOG sticks around. DRM-free games are always nice to have, and I appreciate how they try to keep the games they sell playable on modern operating systems. LikeLiked by 1 person FWIW, Valheim is still on my Steam Wishlist, but I’m one of those nuts who refuse to buy a game that is in Early Access. Once it leaves Early Access and I know the game has a complete storyline, I’m in. LikeLike I feel you. As I replied to Bhagpuss, early access is one of those things that works, except when it doesn’t. In the case of Valheim I think what is there when it does comes out of early access will be much better than what might have arrived had they insisted on waiting until it was “done” to launch it. Or not. The whole “must be annoyingly difficult” aspects of the last three biomes might have been skipped had they waited. Who knows? I will say, once again, that I got my money’s worth out of it with three big play-throughs. LikeLike Wishes do have a sort of ‘softness’ or positivity versus predictions that I like. Kudos for coming up with that. Half Life 3: I feel like I’m too out of touch with all of the ‘2+’ material now to be the proper audience for the game. Back in the day in the year or two after Half Life 2 launched I was desperate for the next episode. Now I’d probably need a full set of remakes of the intermediate content to get up to speed again. LikeLike The 20th Anniversary update might just be the thing for you, then: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220/view/6633333780228604001. Both episodes and the Lost Coast bit are now included with the main game. LikeLike The WoW roadmap you linked does show housing coming at the end of 2025… so we might get to find out about that wish sooner than you seem to think! LikeLike The roadmap shows a little icon, which could mean whatever Blizz decides it means. Given their history, I have trouble seeing Blizz launching housing outside of a full expansion release, and we aren’t even getting the next expansion reveal until late next year. I am skeptical like that. Anyway, my wish is that they don’t screw it up. We might know enough to register that before Dec. 15. LikeLike I knew you were gonna say that! 😄 It’s because of people like you (or possibly other reasons) that they actually changed the roadmap from the original image (which matches the one you uploaded) to one that simply shows a house at that point. LikeLike They changed the icon later? How rude! Still, it is just an icon, which lends itself to some level of ambiguity. It could mean housing starts for the holidays. It could mean the big housing reveal with a launch at a later date. It could mean an new trailer with no details. And, where it stands, it could mean nothing before Dec. 15th, so no wish granted.

Title: Databases in 2024: A Year in Review
URL: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2025/01/2024-databases-retrospective.html
Time Published: 2025-01-01T14:27:39Z
Full Content:
Like a shot to your dome piece, I'm back to hit you with my annual roundup of what happened in the rumble-tumble game of databases. Yes, I used to write this article on the OtterTune blog, but the company is dead (RIP). I'm doing this joint on my professor blog. There is much to cover from the past year, from 10-figure acquisitions, vendors running wild in the streets with license changes, and the most famous database octogenarian splashing cash to recruit a college quarterback to impress his new dimepiece. I promised my first wife that I would write more professionally this year. I have also been informed that some universities assign my annual blog articles as required reading in their database courses. Let's see how it goes. Previous entries: We live in the golden era of databases. There are many excellent (relational) choices for all types of application domains. Many are open-source despite being built by for-profit companies backed by VC money. But VCs want that money back and their trap full, so these companies turn out a hosted service for their DBMSs on the cloud. But the cloud makes open-source DBMSs a tricky business. If a system becomes too popular, then a cloud vendor (like Amazon) slaps it up as a service and makes more money than the company paying for the development of the software. This threat is why many database companies change to more restrictive source code licenses that protect against cloud vendors from reselling their products. MongoDB was among the first to do this in 2018 when they switched to their Server Side Public License (SSPL). This past year was a turbulent one for license changes, and the most prominent two were Redisâ¢ and Elasticsearch. Redis Ltd. (the company) is on an aggressive path towards its IPO. Originally starting as Redis Labs in 2011, they switched their name to Redis Ltd. in 2021 when they acquired the Redis trademark from its creator (Salvatore Sanfilippo), who Redis Labs had bankrolled. Over the last few years, Redis Ltd. has attempted to consolidate control over the Redis landscape. The company has also tried to cast off the perception that the system is primarily used as an in-memory cache by adding support for vectors and other data models. In March 2024, Redis Ltd. announced they were switching from the system's original (very permissive) BSD-3 license to a dual license comprising the proprietary Redis Source Available License and MongoDB's SSPL. The company announced this change the same day they announced the acquisition of Speedb, an open-source fork of RocksDB. The backlash to the Redis license move was quick. The same week the license changed, two forks were announced based on the original BSD-3 code line: Valkey and Redict. Valkey started at Amazon, but engineers at Google and Oracle quickly joined. In only one week, the Valkey project clapped back at Redis Ltd. when it became part of the Linux Foundation, and several major companies shifted their development efforts to it. Redis Ltd. did not help their perception of being up to no good when they got frisky with their beloved trademark and started taking over open-source Redis extensions. In an obvious homage to when Bushwick Bill (RIP), Scarface, and Willie D got back together in 2015, the Redis' creator announced in December 2024 that he is in touch with the Redis Ltd. management and is looking to make a comeback to reunite the Redis community. Elastic N.V. is the for-profit company backing the development of the leading text-search Elasticsearch DBMS. In 2021, they announced their switch to a dual-license model of the Elastic License and MongoDB's SSPL. Again, this was in response to the rising prominence of Amazon's Elasticsearch offering, even though the service had been out since 2015. Amazon didn't take this switch kindly and announced their OpenSearch fork. Three years later, Elastic N.V. announced in August 2024 that they reverted their license change and switched to the AGPL. Their blog article announcing this change references Kendrick Lamar's songs (e.g., Not Like Us). Amazon did not like being called the Drake of Databases and announced the following month that they were transferring ownership of the OpenSearch project to the Linux Foundation. This turmoil seems like a lot just over licenses, but remember, there is big money in databases. And this is just two systems! I didn't even discuss Greenplum quietly killing off their open-source repository after nine years and going proprietary. But people did not notice because nobody willingly runs Greenplum anymore. The only DBMS I know of that made the same open-source reversal is Altibase in 2023. I'll be blunt: I don't care for Redis. It is slow, it has fake transactions, and its query syntax is a freakshow. Our experiments at CMU found Dragonfly to have much more impressive performance numbers (even with a single CPU core). In my database course, I use the Redis query language as an example of what not to do. Nevertheless, I am sympathetic to Redis Ltd.'s plight of being overrun by Amazon. However, the company is overestimating the barrier of entry to build a simplistic system like Redis; it is much lower than building a full-featured DBMS (e.g., Postgres), so there are several alternatives to the OG Redis. They are not in position of strength where such posturing will be tolerated by the community. The Elasticsearch saga is the same story as Redis, except they are further along in the plot: the company announces license change, competitors create an open-source fork, and the company reverts to an open-source license to muted fanfare. Notice that Redis and Elasticsearch are receiving more backlash compared to other systems that made similar moves. There was no major effort to fork off MongoDB, Neo4j, Kafka, or CockroachDB when they announced their license changes. CockroachDB even changed its license again in 2024 to make larger enterprises start paying up. It cannot be because the Redis and Elasticsearch install base is so much larger than these other systems, and therefore, there were more people upset by the change since the number of MongoDB and Kafka installations was equally as large when they switched their licenses. In the case of Redis, I can only think that people perceive Redis Ltd. as unfairly profiting off others' work since the company's founders were not the system's original creators. An analysis of Redis' source code repository also shows that a sizable percentage of contributions to the DBMS comes from outside the company (e.g., Tencent, Alibaba). This "stolen valor" was the reason for the ire HashiCorp received when they changed Terraform's license in 2023. The overarching issue in these license shuffles is the long-term viability of open-source independent software vendors (ISVs) in the database market. The cloud vendors are behemoths with infinite money. If an open-source DBMS takes off, they will start hosting it and make more money than the ISV. Or they will add your DBMS's wire protocol as a front-end to an existing DBMS, like when AWS added InfluxDB v2 protocol support for their Timestream DBMS in March 2024. They can then be the girlfriend of the aforementioned Bushwick Bill and shoot you in the eye, like when AWS announced that their new Valkey-compatible services are 30% cheaper than their Redis-compatible services. There continues to be no love lost between Databricks and Snowflake. This fight is a classic database war that has spilled out into the streets. The two companiesâ previous feud over query performance has expanded to other areas of data management and become much more expensive. Databricks took the first shot in March 2024 when they announced they spent $10 million to build their DBRX open-source LLM with 132 billion parameters. The Mosaic team led the development of the DBRX model, which Databricks acquired in 2023 for $1.3 billion. One month later, Snowflake rolled up to the same corner and lit it up using their Arctic open-source LLM with 480 billion parameters. Snowflake boasted they only spent $2 million to train their model while outperforming DBRX for âenterpriseâ tasks like SQL generation. You can tell that Snowflake cares most about taking a shot at Databricks because their announcement shows other LLMs doing better than them (e.g., Llama3), but they highlight how they are better than DBRX. One AI researcher was confused about why Snowflake focused so much on DBRX in their analysis and not the other models; this person does not know how much blood these two database rivals have spilled. While the public LLM battle raged, another front in the war between Databricks and Snowflake opened up behind the scenes over catalogs. For most of the 2010s, Hiveâs HCatalog has been the de facto catalog system on data lakes. Iceberg and Hudi emerged as replacements in the late 2010s from Netflix and Uber, respectively, and both became top-level Apache projects backed by VC-funded startups. These systems provide a meta-data service to track files and support transactional ingestion of new data on an object store (e.g., S3). Databricks has a proprietary catalog service called Unity, which works with its DeltaLake platform. Snowflake announced their initial integration with Iceberg-backed tables in 2022. They then expanded their support for Iceberg over the next few years. Then, they looked into acquiring Tabular, the main company behind Iceberg, to compete against Databricks with Unity and DeltaLake. The story goes that Snowflake was about to close the deal for $600 million. But then Databricks crashed the party and splashed $2 billion to acquire Tabular. Databricks announced the acquisition the same day as the Snowflake CEOâs conference keynote address, where he was announcing their new open-source Polaris catalog service in June 2024. Databricks continued to kick Snowflake in the teeth when they announced they were open-sourcing their Unity catalog the following week. Straight murdergram. What is interesting about this database battle is that it is not just about raw performance numbers. It isnât like the old Oracle versus Informix shootout of the 1990s, where they were mostly boasting about faster query latencies. It is true that the battle also went beyond just benchmark shots when Informix sued Oracle (and later had to withdraw their suit) because Oracle poached some top Informix executives. Later, the world found out that the Informix CEO had cooked the companyâs books to inflate revenue numbers to look better against Oracle and had to do a two-month bid in the federal clink. Instead, the Snowflake versus Databricks battle has expanded to be about the ecosystem around the database. That is, it is about the infrastructure people use to get their data into a database and then the tools they use on that data. Vectorized execution engines for analytical queries are a commodity now. Databricks and every other OLAP vendor follow Snowflakeâs architecture design from 2013, originally based on one of the Snowflake co-foundersâ Ph.D. thesis. What matters now are quality-of-life facets (which are hard to monetize and compare with competitors), compatibility with other tools, and AI/LLM magic. At least the competition between Snowflake and Databricks has an upside for consumers. Such ferocity means better products and technology for data (e.g., Snowflakeâs Polaris is now an Apache project) and eventually (hopefully) lower prices. Itâs not like the previous pissing match between Oracle and SalesForce CEOs, where it was two rich guys taking pop shots at each other during their expensive conferences. In the same way that Postgres is the default choice for anyone starting a new operational database, DuckDB has entered the zeitgeist as the default choice for someone wanting to run analytical queries on their data. Pandas previously held DuckDB's crowned position. Given DuckDB's insane portability, there are several efforts to stick it inside existing DBMSs that do not have great support for OLAP workloads. This year, we saw the release of four different extensions to stick DuckDB up inside Postgres. The first announcement came in May 2024 when Crunchy Data revealed their proprietary bridge for rewiring Postgres to route OLAP queries to DuckDB. They later announced an expanded version of their extension to leverage DuckDB's geospatial capabilities to accelerate PostGIS queries. In June 2024, ParadeDB announced their open-source extension (pg_analytics) that uses Postgres' foreign data wrapper API to call into DuckDB; they previously were using DataFusion in an earlier version (pg_lakehouse) but switched to the Duck. Then, in August 2024, the next DuckDB-for-Postgres extension (pg_duck) came out. The source code for this extension is hosted under the DuckDB Labs GitHub organization. As such, this is the officially sanctioned DuckDB extension for Postgres. The original announcement touted this project as being a collaboration between MotherDuck, Hydra, Microsoft, and Neon. The latter two were (allegedly) kicked out of the mix over a dispute on development controls, similar to Arabian Prince leaving NWA. The repository now only lists it as a joint effort between MotherDuck and Hydra. The latest DuckDB extension dropped in November 2024 with pg_mooncake. Mooncake differs from the other three because it supports writing data through Postgres into Iceberg tables with full transaction support. Most OLAP queries do not access that much data. Fivetran analyzed traces from Snowflake and Redshift and showed that the median amount of data scanned by queries is only 100 MB. Such a small amount of data means a single DuckDB instance is enough for most to handle most queries. DuckDB's convenience and portability are the reasons for its proliferation in the Postgres community. Although ClickHouse has existed since 2016, it was not as easy to run as DuckDB until recently (see this blog article that discusses the steps to deploy ClickHouse in 2018). These DuckDB extensions are a single entry point to the broader data ecosystem. Users no longer need to install separate extensions to access data in Iceberg and separately for S3. DuckDB can handle all of that for you. It allows organizations to gain high-performance analytics without needing an expensive data warehouse. Postgres' support for extensions and plugins is impressive. One of the original design goals of Postgres from the 1980s was to be extensible. The intention was to easily support new access methods and new data types and operations on those data types (i.e., object-relational). Since 2006, Postgres' "hook" API. Our research shows that Postgres has the most expansive and diverse extension ecosystem compared to every other DBMS. We also found that the DBMS's lack of guard rails means that extensions can interfere with each other and cause incorrect behavior. Earlier projects that added columnar storage to Postgres (e.g., Citus, Timescale) only solved part of the problem. Columnar data formats improve retrieving data from storage. However, a DBMS cannot fully exploit those formats if it still uses a row-oriented query processing model (e.g., Postgres). Using DuckDB provides both columnar storage and vectorized query processing. There is likely a turducken joke here involving an elephant, but I will not make it because I do not want to get fired or put on probation by the university (again). Many one-off events happened with databases last year that you might have overlooked. Here is a quick summary of them: There isn't much public information yet about how AWS implemented their new "Spanner-like" DBMS (see Mark Brooker's discussion about the DBMS architecture). The key ideas are a distributed log service (rumors were it was going to be based on now-defunct QLDB) and timestamp ordering via Time Sync. But this announcement shows you how much brand recognition the name "Aurora" carries in the database world because AWS used it for this new DBMS that seemingly shares no code with their flagship Aurora Postgres RDS offering. Umbra is one of the most state-of-the-art DBMSs written by the world's greatest database systems researcher (Thomas Neumann). But Thomas is content with staying at his university to work on Umbra, remaining comfortably on top of the Clickbench leaderboard, and not worrying about pesky customers. That's why his top Ph.D. students forked his code and are commercializing it as CedarDB. The only interesting part of this announcement is that the former vanguard of the NoSQL movement in the late 2000s now supports SQL in 2024. Turso has been working on the libSQL fork of SQLite for a while, but they went all out in 2024 by announcing a complete rewrite of SQLite in Rust. In their announcement, they correctly point out that the value of SQLite is not just from its code, but also from the insane test engineering that ensures it runs correctly everywhere. That is why the Limbo developers are working with a deterministic testing startup by ex-FoundationDB people. See FoundationDB's 2020 CMU-DB talk for more information on what this testing means. This key-value store is the successor to the impressive FASTER system from Microsoft Research. It is compatible with Redis and supports inter-query parallelism, larger-than-memory databases, and real transactions. Redis should not be anybody's first choice these days. Six years after MySQL v8 went GA, the team turned v9 out on the streets. But people quickly found that it crashed if your database had more than 8000 tables. I am underwhelmed with the feature list in this new major version. Oracle is putting all its time and energy into its proprietary MySQL Heatwave service. MySQL is still widely used, but the excitement is not there anymore. Everyone has moved on to Postgres. It has been seven years since the latest major version of Prometheus. There are so many compatible alternatives now that the OG Prometheus may not be the best option for some organizations. I've never met anybody who uses Alteryx, and I don't have an opinion about them. Hopefully the PE people buying the MariaDB Corporation can clean up the mess. See my analysis from last year about the MariaDB dumpster fire. This purchase makes sense if you are one of the leading Postgres ISVs. Postgres has a great front-end but an outdated storage architecture. OrioleDB fixes that problem. Better ETL tooling to get data out of Postgres and into ClickHouse. This is a smart move by ClickHouse, Inc. They bought themselves a fancy SQL editor UI. It is a quality-of-life improvement. See the discussion above. They are likely going to use Speedb to allow Redis to spill data to disk. Speedb's developers never explained what changes and improvements they made in their RocksDB fork (or I could not find it?). See Mark Callaghan's recent comparison of Speedb vs. RocksDB. This is big news for the company, but unfortunately they had to shutdown the DBaaS in September 2024. Rockset had a great engineering team with some of the best database engineers from Facebook. I just never liked how their DBMS stored three copies of your data in its indexes. Again, see the discussion above. Iceberg is the standard (sorry Hudi); even Amazon S3 now supports it. It remains to be seen how the adoption of Polaris will evolve and whether they will be able to maintain compatibility in the long term. I guess Cloudera is still alive? Rewriting Kafka in golang but then making it spill to S3. I'm happy for the Warpstream team, but Confluent could have done this themselves. There are a few more raises from CedarDB, SpiralDB, and others but those amounts are not public yet. If Amazon can't figure out how to make money on a blockchain database, then nobody can. And yes, I know QLDB is not a true P2P blockchain, but it's close enough. Dana, Bohan, and I worked on this research project and startup for almost a decade. And now it is dead. I am disappointed at how a particular company treated us at the end, so they are forever banned from recruiting CMU-DB students. They know who they are and what they did. I want to also give special props to Andres Freund for discovering the xz backdoor in 2024 while working on Postgres at Microsoft. This attack was a two-year campaign to inject malicious code into an important compression library widely used in computing. Although the backdoor targeted SSH and not Postgres directly, it is another example of why database engineers are some of the best programmers in the world. Databricks has blown away all other fundraising in the world of databases for the second year in a row with a disgustingly brash $10 billion Series J round. This is after their $500 million Series I in 2023 and $1.6 billion Series H in 2021. What is different about this time is this funding was for buying stock from employees who were getting impatient about Databricks' inevitable IPO. CMU-DB has several alumni at Databricks, including a former #1 ranked Ph.D. student. I know some of them are anxiously awaiting the Databricks IPO before deciding what to do next. The upcoming year is going to be the test of strength for many database startups. Nobody wants to be the next MariaDB Corporation, and thus several are waiting to ride Databricks' wake before going IPO themselves. Declining interest rates in the upcoming year may open up additional funding for several database companies that have raised large amounts more than two years ago (e.g., CockroachDB, Starburst, Imply, DataStax, SingleStore, Firebolt). The one standout from this crowd is dbtLabs, which I have heard is comfortably crushing it. See also the Database of Databases list of new DBMSs released in 2024. Do you know who had their 80th birthday this year? The legendary Larry Ellison! Once again, we see that he is a man who refuses to settle down or be put into a box. First, Larry propelled himself up Forbes' Billionaires List to become the third richest person in the world. In March 2024, the Oracle stock rose so much that he made $15 billion in a single day. Flush with cash, Larry went shopping in July 2024 and signed a deal to purchase Paramount Studios at $6 billion for his only son (third wife). He then decided to relax by buying a Palm Beach resort for only $277 million. These moves happened in just one year, and databases paid for all of it. But these are mere trifles compared to Larry's most significant accomplishment in 2024. Everyone I know was surprised when our Larry Ellison news alerts woke us up in the middle of the night in November 2024. The headlines were touting how Larry helped the University of Michigan football program recruit the premiere college quarterback. The university had previously announced that this player was transferring from Louisiana State to Michigan. Their press release included a curious acknowledgement to "Larry and his wife Jolin" for helping with the recruiting effort. Reporters soon confirmed that this "Larry" was the one and only Larry Ellison! Larry contributed $12 million to the booster campaign to bankroll the best quarterback's move to Michigan. The bigger mystery in this story was the identity of this "Jolin" person. Investigators found older photos of Larry watching a tennis match with a woman wearing a Michigan hat. Then, two weeks later, a major news organization broke the story at 5:30 am (my alerts woke me up again) that the woman's identity was Jolin (Keren) Zhu and they confirmed that she was Larry's new wife. I am beaming with pride over what Larry accomplished in the past year. He famously did not graduate from any university and had no prior connection to the University of Michigan. And yet, because the love of his life went to Michigan about a decade ago, Larry made magic happen by writing a check for a measly $12 million (about 0.0055% of his net worth). I told Larry this especially means a lot to me because my former #1 ranked Ph.D. student is now a professor in Michigan's Computer Science department with their famous Database Group. What is even more fantastic about this story is that Larry is again in love! Too many people struggle in today's world to find that special somebody. Dating apps are a mess, speed dating events are awkward, and it is now considered uncouth to hang around a playground to meet single parents when you do not have kids of your own. Then, just when you think you finally found the right person, it all falls apart when you learn they do not wash their socks regularly or like to put hot sauce on cold cereal. That is why everyone was telling me that Larry would never get married again after his 2010 divorce from romance novelist Melanie Craft (fourth wife). Those people were telling me the same thing after his 2020 divorce from Nikita Kahn (fifth wife). But I knew better, and Larry proved me right with his surreptitious marriage to Keren Zhu (sixth wife)! I was planning on starting this article boasting how this is the first time in three years where I was celebrating NYE not sick. But then my biological daughter gave me COVID so I'm laid up with that. I got boosted back in September and they gave me Paxlovid, so I'll survive this. I am disappointed that OtterTune is dead. But I learned a lot and got to work with many brilliant people. I am a big fan of Intel Capital and Race Capital for sticking with us to the end. I hope to announce our next start-up soon (hint: itâs about databases). In the meantime, I am happy to be back full-time at Carnegie Mellon University. Jignesh Patel and I have some baller research projects that we hope to turn out this upcoming year. I am also looking forward to teaching a new course on query optimization this semester. I need to figure out to juice my stats because in September 2024, Wikipedia removed the article about me over not having enough citations. We are staying true to DJ Mooshoo while he is locked up in Cook County. We hope to free him in 2025. Lastly, I want to give a shout-out to ByteBase for their article Database Tools in 2024: A Year in Review. In previous years, they emailed me asking for permission to translate my end-of-year database articles into Chinese for their blog. This year, they could not wait for me to finish writing this one, so they jocked my flow and wrote their own off-brand article with the same title and premise.

Title: 2024 gaming report card: how did PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo fare?

Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? After a long and busy 12 months, 2024 is officially in the books. Players have a few weeks to rest before the video game release calendar picks up in February with a barrage of major releases. That’s a problem for next month, though. Until then, we’ve still got some time to reflect on what was a rollercoaster year for the gaming industry, full of surprise hits, total flops, and surprising no shows. At the center of all that was the three pillars of mainstream gaming: Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo. While their power may be waning in the age of portable PCs like the Steam Deck, these platform holders are still the watercooler conversation starters whose every move generates buzz. This year, all three companies found themselves in a strange spot. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X hit the awkward midpoint of their lifespans, while the Nintendo Switch was left to tread water after its much anticipated successor was pushed out of 2024. All three would have to get creative if they were going to end the year strong. The good news is that all three pulled that task off, even if no one excelled. Each company had an asterisk on its record that created an uneven year no matter which console you played on. Continuing last year’s tradition, we’re once again closing out the year by handing out final grades to Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo. All three passed, but they’ll all need to study harder if they’re going to become A students in 2025. If I were a tough grader, I’d have good reason to flunk the PS5 this year. Sony’s year was full of flops and disappointments that made its 2024 look dire in a vacuum. Its biggest hardship came in the form of Concord, a game that was meant to usher in PlayStation’s live service future. Instead, it was an immediate failure that was taken offline in weeks and the studio behind it was shuttered. That one costly disaster may have put years of planning in jeopardy, single-handedly changing what PlayStation’s future will look like. That bad news was coupled by some soft letdowns. The much anticipated PS5 Pro finally launched this year, but with underwhelming specs considering its eye-popping price tag. That made the system a slow starter, one that raised questions about how much incremental power is really necessary in a console. It didn’t help that the system’s AI upscaling tool, PSSR, was a bit buggy at launch, too. Elsewhere on the hardware front, Sony seemed to all but abandon its VR ambitions, offering very little software support for PlayStation VR2 (it’s biggest upgrade this year was PC support). At times, it felt like Sony’s hardware business had hit a brick wall. If I were only looking at those lowlights, though, it would be a reductive view of what was a strong year for PlayStation overall. Sony’s wins didn’t come from hyped up first-party exclusives like Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, but through unexpected surprises that helped expand the system to new audiences. The crown jewel of the crop was Astro Bot, which found Sony once again making the kind of all-ages platformer that helped build the original PlayStation. Helldivers 2 emerged as a live service success story that counter-balanced Concord‘s failure. Even Stellar Blade landed as a pleasant surprise, allowing a Korean developer to find international success. In between those peaks, we got a handful of third-party exclusives that gave the PS5 the best game lineup of any console this year. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth delivered the praise that Final Fantasy XVI couldn’t quite achieve in 2023, while Bloober Team’s Silent Hill 2 pulled off the impossible task of remaking one of the best games of all time in a satisfying manner. Those highs were enough to round out an uneven year where Sony leaned heavily on unnecessary double dips like Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. It may have been the PS5’s best and worst year in one. Grade: B Since the launch of the Xbox Series X in 2020, it was clear that Microsoft’s console was going to have an unusual lifespan. Microsoft made it clear early on that it wasn’t necessarily trying to pump out killer apps so much as it was trying to make Game Pass a lifestyle subscription service that every gamer needed. 2024 would take that experiment to some truly unpredictable places that left Xbox fans with whiplash; we seemingly alternated between terrible news and great games every month. The bad side was very bad. Xbox kicked the year off with mass layoffs, which shut down both Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. The latter was incredibly puzzling considering that the studio had developed perhaps the Series X’s best exclusive, Hi-Fi Rush, just one year prior. Later in the year, Microsoft rolled out a convoluted Game Pass price hike that turned the “best deal in gaming” into a pricey proposition. It didn’t help that some of the service’s biggest games didn’t exactly pan out as expected. Both Stalker 2 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 were buggy messes at launch, while Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 and Starfield: Shattered Space landed as underwhelming releases. It was a constant PR crisis for Xbox in 2024, even when it wasn’t warranted. Xbox’s decision to release certain exclusives on competing platforms should have been a cause for celebration as Microsoft eroded the annoying exclusivity wall that divides consoles. Instead, the move fueled console war outrage. Similar, Xbox made great strides to make its game more accessible than ever, bringing Game Pass to devices like Amazon Fire Stick. That too was criticized thanks to the company’s “This is an Xbox” ad campaign, which implied that any device that could run its games was essentially an Xbox. That move rubbed console purists the wrong way, but I see the underlying message as a positive step forward for video games. While it wasn’t a huge year for exclusives, Xbox delivered where it mattered. It ended the year strong with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, two of the best-received games of this Xbox generation. In route to those tentpole release, we got a steady stream of “day one” third-party releases that still sold the service’s value. Dungeons of Hinterberg and Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess are both sleeper hits that ended up on Digital Trends best 10 games of 2024 list. With that in mind, I’m willing to let Xbox out of 2024 with a perfectly good, if unremarkable grade. I expect to see some big improvement in 2025, though. Grade: B- After receiving a coveted A grade in last year’s report, Nintendo had a big task ahead of it — and it sounded like it would have no problem delivering. After all, 2024 was surely going to be the year we finally got the Nintendo Switch 2, bringing a bevy of heavy hitting exclusives like Mario Kart 9 or Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Well … that didn’t happen. After all the anticipation, Nintendo’s new console was a total no show. Nintendo would acknowledge its existence after years of speculation, but it stopped short of actually showing it off or announcing so much as a spec. That left Nintendo in a weird spot when it came to software. It was clear that the company’s most celebrated developers were quietly working on new games for the platform, leaving the B-squad to fill out the Switch’s final full year. To Nintendo’s credit, it delivered at least one exclusive a month from January to December, but the actually lineup was eclectic. Very few Switch exclusives released in 2024 were must-own library additions. The closest ones were Super Mario Party Jamboree and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, but nothing rose to the level of Super Mario Odyssey or Fire Emblem: Three Houses. Instead, we got a buffet of niche games and odd remakes. It’s not that games like Mario vs. Donkey Kong or Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition weren’t welcome on Switch; it’s just that these were the console’s primary games rather than quirky filler. Those games didn’t always deliver either, as games like Endless Ocean: Luminous and Princess Peach: Showtime! felt more like underdeveloped experiments than the kind of polished games we’ve come to expect in the Switch’s lifespan. Even if it was an underwhelming year overall, the experimental nature of Switch’s year occasionally led to the kind of highlights that can only happen when a publisher isn’t being precious. Emio — The Smiling Man is a fantastic revival of Famicom Detective Club that I don’t think we would ever get outside of a year like this. Splatoon 3‘s underappreciated Side Order DLC is a true hidden gem, and I can’t complain about a full remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. The peaks weren’t exactly high, but this is the kind of strange year that I imagine I’ll look back on with nostalgia in a few years when Nintendo is back in its usual rotation of predictable hits. Grade: C+ With all of the political turmoil right now, it can be hard to get in the festive spirit — but PowerWash Simulator wants to help with its latest free update, offering a Christmas-themed ice rink map to explore and clean up. You might think you've gotten your fill of that already, especially if you had to clean real-world decorations before bringing them in from the garage, but we promise that digital muck is a lot more fun to clean up than the real thing. And we'll take digital spiders over the real ones any day of the week. Grab a nice warm cup of hot chocolate, some comfortable shoes, and snuggle up for a night of the most fun cleaning you've ever done. The update introduces a new, free DLC that comes with the ice rink area, as well as winter weather gear so that you can bundle up while on the job. The clothing includes a cleaning suit emblazoned with snowflakes, a candy cane theme for the sprayer, and more. If you've never played the game before, now's the perfect chance. The update also comes with a free demo so you can get a taste of what makes this game so relaxing to play. If you find you enjoy it, there's plenty more free DLC to check out yourself, as well as paid DLC for fans of Shrek and Warhammer: 40,000. The MMO genre is overflowing with titles vying for the attention of anyone willing to invest significant portions of their time in a single game. There are no doubt plenty of killer choices you can make based on what type of combat, endgame, and payment model you prefer, ensuring that you'll almost certainly find one that fits you just right. I've been investing off and on in the genre for over two decades, with thousands of hours poured into everything from old, niche titles like Silkroad Online (which I just learned somehow still exists) to worldwide successes like World of Warcraft and Guild Wars. In recent years, though, I find myself disappointed in various aspects of many popular MMOs, whether it's an overwhelming focus on endgame raiding, too much PVP-centric content, or unfriendly communities that make me cringe when I even glance at the chat. None of that is a problem when I return to Final Fantasy XIV. I somehow feel at peace each time I load up Square Enix's long-running MMO, and it's becoming harder and harder for me to want to venture elsewhere. Sony could be following up the release of the PlayStation Portal with a new handheld PlayStation 5 console, according to a new report. Bloomberg claims that Sony is working on a portable PlayStation 5 and would be in direct competition with the Nintendo Switch successor or an Xbox handheld, which Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said is in early testing. However, the PlayStation handheld is likely years away from an announcement even if it makes it to production. So nothing is guaranteed.

Title: Bear Market Here? $0.14 Altcoin DTX Exchange (DTX) Grabs Attention While Altcoins Like Cardano and Polkadot Bleed
URL: https://zycrypto.com/bear-market-here-0-14-altcoin-dtx-exchange-dtx-grabs-attention-while-altcoins-like-cardano-and-polkadot-bleed/

In the ongoing correction, Bitcoin has dropped below $92,000 from its peak of $108,388. Many analysts are discussing whether this correction will end soon or continue as a bear market. Though well-known coins like Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) have experienced significant price drops, crypto experts believe this is just a profit booking from last month’s recent bull run. With the expectation of a bottom soon, savvy traders are searching for the next great opportunity, combining innovation, strong fundamentals, and exponential price rallies. The $0.14 altcoin DTX Exchange (DTX) has attracted crypto whales and institutions because of its massive upside potential and innovative leadership quality in the exchange market. Cardano (ADA) has been one of the leaders in the crypto market due to its strategic importance, standards, and rapid developments in the ecosystem. In November’s rally, it surged 216%, climbing above the $1 psychological mark. However, the profit booking has been severe as the Cardano (ADA) price has dropped 36% from the peak. It is currently trying to stabilize itself above the lower band of the descending wedge pattern. The wedge pattern is a historical formation. The previous leg could continue if Cardano (ADA) breaks the local resistance of the pattern. The recent decline in the ADA price results from shifting sentiment from large-cap to low-cap coins. To reverse the price action in Cardano (ADA), the project’s strategic partnership and interest should see growth in the coming months. Polkadot saw a sharp drop of over 25% in the last month of the year, settling around the $6.5 mark with a 19.34% loss. Despite this, several factors position DOT as one of the top cryptos to consider. Community sentiment on CoinMarketCap stands at an impressive 88% bullish, with analysts offering a positive outlook for its future. One potential driver for Polkadot’s price growth is its new ability to connect with other blockchain networks. This connection on Polkadot, powered by Hyperbridge, allows users to transfer assets seamlessly across chains without intermediaries. DTX Exchange (DTX) is making a mark in the DeFi world with its advanced and first hybrid trading platform, attracting users globally. By pioneering the integration of multi-asset trading, experts believe DTX could revolutionize the trading industry and take over major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. It offers 120,000+ asset classes and increased buying capacity up to 1,000x for larger market positions. This allows traders to diversify their portfolios and enhance their profitability efficiently. The platform has a no-KYC policy, enabling full platform access without revealing identity. With the platform’s advanced analytical tools, traders can analyze a large amount of data to identify potential market opportunities. Features like algorithmic trading help them automate any strategy to capture sudden price movements. Due to its unique capabilities, the recent Phoenix Wallet launch has skyrocketed in demand. This wallet provides a secure custody solution for stocks, cryptos, and forex and offers low interest rates and fees. In the 7th presale stage, DTX has over 380,000 active wallet addresses and raised over $11.2 million in record time. Analysts predict the price could surge from $0.14 to $14, presenting 100x gains. Industry experts predict that the DTX Exchange will soon hit the exchanges and will be a solid competitor to Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT), which have both seen tremendous profits in the past.
