Companies like Dell, Salesforce, and Bank of America have already established return-to-office (RTO) policies. Walmart recently joined the RTO mandate but is attempting to address concerns with a state-of-the-art, 350-acre campus designed to build community and make in-office work more appealing to employees accustomed to flexible arrangements. Amazon is the latest company to take a stricter stance on RTO. In a recent memo, CEO Andy Jassy announced that all employees will be required to return to the office five days a week starting January 2, 2025. Jassy aims to strengthen Amazon's culture and teams, aspiring to operate like "the world's largest startup." Like others before it, Amazon's decision has sparked debate, drawing both detractors and proponents. Detractors argue that remote work leads to happier, more productive employees. Some even suggest that RTO policies are thinly veiled cost-cutting measures, allowing companies to avoid traditional layoffs. Dropbox, for example, has fully embraced virtual work, reinforcing that remote setups can thrive. On the other side, proponents of in-office work emphasize benefits like mentorship and addressing isolation issues. Nearly 4 in 10 parents say they go days without leaving their house when working from home, and 33% report feeling "very isolated," according to the Modern Family Index conducted by The Harris Poll for Bright Horizons. This debate over the ideal work environment is unlikely to end soon. However, RTO policies offer advantages in two critical areas for companies looking to strengthen their culture and teams. A KPMG survey reveals that 79% of CEOs expect their hybrid employees to return full-time to the office by 2027, an abrupt rise from just 34% earlier this year. Jassy and other CEOs like Starbucks' Brian Niccol believe teams should be together as much as possible, as shared in Bloomberg. Jassy's memo emphasized that being in the office makes it "easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another." Amazon wants to act like a startup—agile, fast, and efficient. Reducing barriers to these goals is the bet Amazon and other companies are making with these policy reversals. Moreover, RTO could mitigate some of the negative aspects of remote work, such as isolation and loneliness, along with blurred work-life boundaries. According to a Wall Street Journal report, remote employees sometimes feel heavily isolated and akin to feeling more like mercenaries than part of a cohesive unit. As organizations grow, they often become mired in red tape and bureaucratic inefficiencies. These inefficiencies can frustrate employees and slow down operations, affecting overall performance. Jassy's memo hints at these challenges: "Do we have the right org structure to drive the level of ownership and speed we desire?" The frustration with unnecessary meetings, excessive layers of approval, and prolonged deliberation is widespread. Jassy's note echoes this sentiment: "pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings, a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward, owners of initiatives feeling less like they should make recommendations because the decision will be made elsewhere." Unfortunately, communication can suffer when teams disperse, and the company grows. By returning to the office, Amazon aims to streamline communication, reduce management layers, and empower individual contributors. The goal is to see improvements in performance, collaboration, and overall culture. With Amazon's latest RTO policy, companies are signaling that they view flexible work arrangements as a benefit, not a given right. Management and organizations are reverting back to pre-COVID business norms, where leaders can interact face-to-face with their teams rather than through a monitor. While remote work and hybrid arrangements have advantages, only time will tell which approach best supports the organization and its people in the modern business world. One Community. Many Voices.

September 22, 2024 12:21 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Class A common stock of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) between November 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased CrowdStrike Class A common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating its Falcon software platform, and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the CrowdStrike’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: CrowdStrike (CRWD), Press Reports Ex-Employees Say “‘Quality control was not part of our process,’” Securities Class Action Pending - Hagens Berman

September 22, 2024 12:03 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On September 12, 2024, SEMAFOR reported that software engineers at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike “complained about rushed deadlines, excessive workloads, and increasing technical problems to higher-ups for more than a year before a catastrophic failure of its software paralyzed airlines and knocked banking and other services offline for hours.” Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 29, 2023 – July 29, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Sept. 30, 2024Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/CRWD Contact the Firm Now: CRWD@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Securities Class Action Against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): According to the September 12, 2024 reporting by SEMAFOR, in the wake of CrowdStrike’s disastrous update to its flagship Falcon Sensor security product that contained a bug that caused a massive overnight outage affecting 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, a certain former employee said “‘[s]peed was the most important thing’” and “‘[q]uality control was not really part of our process or conversation.’” The SEMAFOR article, “CrowdStrike ex employees: ‘Quality control was not part of our process,’” states “[a]lmost two dozen former software engineers, managers, managers and other staff described a workplace where executives prioritized speed over quality, workers weren’t always sufficiently trained, and mistakes around coding and other tasks were rising.” SEMAFOR also reported that “[o]ne former senior manager said they sat in multiple meetings where staff warned company leaders that CrowdStrike would ‘fail’ its customers by releasing products that couldn’t be supported.” The pending litigation focuses on the propriety of CrowdStrike’s representations concerning the efficacy of its AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon platform, including assurances that its technology was “validated, certified, and tested.” The complaint alleges that CrowdStrike’s assurances were false and misleading because the company failed to disclose that: (1) it instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to the company. The company’s assurances came into question beginning on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called “the blue screen of death.” The news was accompanied by several analyst downgrades with one at Guggenheim downgrading CrowdStrike from buy to neutral, reportedly writing that “[t]he restoration of its reputation may take more time and will likely affect new business signings at least in the near-term.” Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike’s customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down $84.24 (-24%) since July 18, 2024.

Dirt Cheap Gold is a gold price comparison tool that helps you find the best deals on 1-ounce gold coins and bars from trusted vendors. Our bots search the internet for the lowest prices, so you donât have to waste time checking multiple sites. We donât use gimmicksâjust straightforward, unbiased data. If you're looking for the cheapest way to stack gold, this is your go-to resource. We automatically update deals every 30 minutes. The deals on this page are current as of 21:32 UTC on 2024-09-23. Email paydirt@dirtcheapgold.com Gold has historically been considered a strong store of value, especially during times of economic uncertainty or inflation. Over the long term, the price of gold has steadily increased, reflecting its role as a hedge against currency depreciation and market volatility. While gold may not offer the same short-term returns as stocks, it tends to retain its value over time, making it a popular choice for preserving wealth. However, like any investment, its performance can fluctuate, and it's important to consider it as part of a diversified portfolio. A stacker is someone who accumulates precious metals, like gold or silver, as a form of wealth preservation. Stackers typically prefer physical bullion such as coins or bars and focus on long-term investment strategies. The goal is often to "stack" as much metal as possible to protect against inflation or economic uncertainty. Most stackers aim to accumulate 5-10% of their net worth in metal. Stacking starts with choosing the right type of gold for your collection. Most beginners opt for popular 1 ounce coins or bars like the American Gold Eagle or Canadian Maple Leaf. Make sure to buy from reputable dealers, compare premiums over spot price, and consider storage options like a safe or bank vault. Diversify your purchases over time, and be mindful of your budget, ensuring that you buy when the price aligns with your goals. The premium on gold coins and bars is the additional cost above the spot price of gold. This premium covers manufacturing, minting, distribution, and dealer costs. Coins tend to have higher premiums than bars due to their intricate designs and collectible value, whereas bars are usually closer to the spot price because they are simpler to produce. We focus on 1-ounce gold bars and coins because they are the most popular and widely traded form of gold bullion. They offer a great balance between affordability and liquidity, making them ideal for both new investors and experienced stackers. Larger bars might offer lower premiums, but 1-ounce products are more flexible when it comes to buying, selling, or trading. Costco began selling gold to members in 2023, offering 1 oz gold bars primarily through its online store. Executive members can enjoy a 2% discount, and using the Costco Anywhere Visa card adds an additional 2% cashback â a combined 4% discount that you'll receive later in the form of a rebate. These savings make Costco a competitive option for purchasing gold, though stock is often limited and sells out quickly. Costco's products don't always appear in the main list on this page, but the table below shows all of the 1 ounce gold products currently available on Costco's website. The discounted prices of these products might make them competitive with products from other sellers. ð¢ Costco doesn't have any 1 ounce gold products for sale right now. Purchase from Costco or Walmart. Those sellers don't have higher prices or fees for credit cards. Storing your gold securely is crucial to protecting your investment. Many stackers choose to store their gold in a home safe, but itâs important to ensure it is fireproof and bolted down. Alternatively, you can store gold in a bank's safe deposit box or a specialized vault service, which offers additional layers of security and insurance. Whether you need to pay sales tax on gold depends on your location. In many states or countries, precious metals like gold are exempt from sales tax if purchased for investment purposes, especially above certain thresholds. Itâs important to check local tax laws to see if exemptions apply where you live. Selling gold is relatively straightforward. You can sell to local coin shops, bullion dealers, or on online platforms like r/Pmsforsale that specialize in precious metals. Itâs important to shop around for the best offer, as prices and premiums may vary. Ensure you understand any fees involved before making a transaction. The amount you can sell your gold for depends on the current spot price of gold and the type of gold you are selling. Dealers will typically offer you slightly below the spot price to cover their costs, and this is known as the buyback price. The condition and purity of your gold, as well as market demand, can also affect the price. Shop around for competit... (truncated)

Investors seeking stocks that can withstand short-term pressures and deliver over the long term should track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is game developer Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO). In August, the company reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Recently, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reiterated a buy rating on Take-Two Interactive stock with a price target of $172. The analyst is upbeat about the company's upcoming releases and expects its bookings to increase by at least 40% in the next fiscal year following mid-single-digit growth this year. Sebastian's robust bookings growth estimate is backed by the expected release of key titles – Civilization VII, Borderlands 4 and the much-anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA VI). Moreover, he expects the company's new console/PC releases to deliver about $2.25 billion in incremental bookings. He anticipates the mobile business will contribute around $3.1 billion, and catalog/live services will generate $2.5 billion in the full year. While management has expressed high confidence in its ability to release GTA VI next year, the analyst thinks that any potential delay between two fiscal years would have a limited impact on TTWO's two-year earnings path. He expects this vital release to generate about $3 billion of bookings in the first year, while enhancing the company's financial flexibility with over $2 billion in free cash flow. "Beyond the next 12-24 months, Take Two should benefit from the long-tail of live services/catalog sales and further depth in the pipeline with sequels to Red Dead, BioShock and Max Payne, and perhaps new 2K sports franchises," said Sebastian. Sebastian ranks No. 286 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.8%.

While the aggressive rate cut was a good start, whether it will prevent the economy from descending ... [+] into recession remain unknown. This article will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve delivered a larger-than-expected half percentage point (0.50%) decrease in short-term interest rates last week. While the rate cut was a virtual certainty, the path forward and whether it will prevent the economy from descending into recession remain unknown. This piece will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, the odds of an economic soft landing should be considered higher than before the move. Though the real (after-inflation) Federal Funds rate remains above 2023, there are likely more rate cuts in the pipeline. After-Inflation Federal Funds Rate Futures pricing assumes another cut to short-term interest rates of at least 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November Fed meeting and a 50% chance of a 50 (0.50%) basis point rate cut. The December meeting has expectations identical to those for November. Number Of Rate Cuts Expected In seven of the last nine easing cycles, the economy was either in recession when the rate cuts began or ended in recession. Still, stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 reacted positively to the outsized rate cut. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed the S&P 500 on the week but are now only 6.6% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 reached a new all-time high during the week, eclipsing the July 16 high. Stock Market Performance The U.S. economy remains resilient, with the Atlanta Fed’s estimate of third-quarter GDP at 2.9%. These estimates provide a real-time estimate of economic growth since quarterly GDP reports are provided with a significant lag. 3Q 2024 U.S. GDP Growth Estimate Other valuable high-frequency reports are the initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits. These claims have improved lately, but any significant softening in the labor market should be seen here first. Initial Jobless Claims The job market has softened. While the unemployment rate at 4.2% remains low on an absolute basis, it has risen off the lows enough to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. There are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some less dire outcomes in the labor market and the economy so far. The employment-to-population ratio is a monthly statistic updated in the monthly jobs report, and so is the unemployment rate. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average Separately, defensive stocks, less impacted by the economy, have often outperformed the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks during these easing cycles since they tend to correspond with periods of economic uncertainty or eventual contraction. Last week showed a better performance for economically sensitive stocks, bolstering the case that markets also viewed the Fed’s actions as supportive of better odds of avoiding recession. Cyclicals Versus Defensives Banks tend to underperform the S&P 500 before and often during recessions since their loan losses and profits are inexorably tied to the economy. Bank stocks significantly outperformed last week, adding to the optimistic view of the impacts of the more significant Fed rate cut on the economy. U.S. Banks Relative Performance Finally, the consumer is crucial for the health of the economy. Looking at the relative performance of the consumer discretionary sector can help indicate when the consumer and, by extension, the U.S. economy might be in trouble. The equal-weighted S&P 500 consumer discretionary index is used; otherwise, Amazon.com (AMZN) would dominate the analysis given its massive size in the capitalization-weighted index. Consistent with the other measures shown, consumer discretionary stocks outperformed. Consumer Discretionary Relative Strength Based on the indicators reviewed in this analysis and current economic data, the base case remains a soft landing. This COVID-related economic cycle is unlike any other, so our typically reliable yield curve and Sahm rule indicators should be viewed more skeptically than usual. The initial reaction to the larger-than-expected 50 basis point rate cut from the Fed has been positive across the soft landing checklist. It indicates that mar... (truncated)

Title: 5 big analyst AI moves: SK Hynix hit by double downgrade; ADI named Top Semis Pick

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! During the week, William Blair analysts have initiated coverage on Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) with an Outperform rating, voicing confidence in the company’s potential for strong earnings per share (EPS) growth and stock price appreciation over the coming years. The firm pointed to several growth drivers for Arm, including “1) higher Average Selling Prices (ASPs) driven by improved monetization and higher value IP; 2) share gains in newer markets like data center; 3) tailwinds from AI driving higher demand for overall compute; and 4) a new upgrade cycle in mobile/PCs.” While Arm’s stock trades at a premium compared to its peers, William Blair believes this is justified by the company’s robust growth outlook, which is expected to become clearer in the financial forecasts for 2026 and 2027. Their discounted cash flow analysis indicates around 35% upside potential for Arm’s shares, supported by sustained revenue growth and increasing profitability over the next decade. In a separate note, William Blair also assigned an Outperform rating to Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), noting the company's strategic expansion into software as a way to buffer against the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. The firm believes that the chipmaker is positioned for continued growth, driven by AI-related demand in networking and custom chip segments, along with the shift to subscription-based models in its VMware (NYSE:VMW) division. Analysts highlighted that nearly two-thirds of VMware customers have transitioned to subscriptions, a significant rise from the 30% seen prior to the acquisition. They also noted that AVGO is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 26x and an enterprise value to free cash flow ratio of 22x based on their 2025 projections, slightly below the median of its peers. “We see room for multiple expansion as the sustainability of growth in networking, customer AI chips, and software becomes clearer,” the note states. Shares of SK Hynix (KS:000660) dropped on Thursday following a double downgrade from Morgan Stanley, with analysts shifting their rating from Overweight to Underweight. In a note, analysts remarked that "the sun is still shining" for the company at the moment. They predict 2024 will be another strong year for SK Hynix, driven by increasing DRAM prices heading into the fourth quarter, which should lead to "exceptional near-term earnings." However, the outlook beyond the fourth quarter appears less favorable. While the long-term potential for DRAM, particularly due to AI-driven demand from data centers, is still promising, the firm noted that cyclical shortages are coming to an end. “Looking past 4Q24, we see sustained risks to the top line and EPS as growth slows, pricing falls, and rising competition in high-bandwith memory (HBM) challenges sustainable long-term margins,” the analysts added. In addition to downgrading the stock, Morgan Stanley also cut its price target for SK Hynix by more than half, lowering it from 260,000 to 120,000 Korean won. In a research note released Tuesday, Citi analysts named Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) as their new top pick in the semiconductor sector. The decision follows Citi's update to its semiconductor stock ranking table, which included a price target adjustment for Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and an upgrade of Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). The firm maintains a positive outlook on the semiconductor industry as a whole. Citi highlighted ADI's lower downside risk in the automotive sector compared to other analog semiconductor makers, particularly following the company’s recent earnings report. This reduced risk, according to Citi, makes ADI well-positioned amid ongoing market uncertainties, leading the firm to rank it at the top of its semiconductor stock table. "ADI is our top pick," Citi analysts stated, adding that they see "lower downside risk in Autos versus other analog names given they have just announced earnings." Broadcom and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), both key players in the AI sector, remain in Citi's second and third spots, respectively. Wedbush analysts said that they believe the AI revolution trade has gained momentum following the Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut, signaling a favorable environment for Big Tech and AI stocks. Wedbush views this aggressive rate cut, alongside a dovish dot plot extending into 2025, as creating a "very bullish backdrop" for the tech sector. The Fed’s move marks a momentous shift, as many investors had been waiting for this signal to fully engage with tech growth stocks leading into 2025. The firm pointed out that the broader technology sector has remained resilient, with recent earnings reports, such as those from Oracle, indicating that the AI revolution is entering its software and application phase.

September 21, 2024 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Sept. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD), DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC), and Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV) Class Period: February 22, 2024 - July 8, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants (1) grossly overstated their ability to forecast the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior products, which forecasting ability was far less capable and effective than Defendants had led investors and analysts to believe; (2) overstated the financial prospects of SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE, and thus overstated the Company's anticipated revenue and other financial metrics; (3) knew or recklessly disregarded that because of the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior's products, Indivior was unlikely to meet its own previously issued and repeatedly reaffirmed FY 2024 net revenue guidance, including its FY 2024 net revenue guidance for SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE; (4) knew or recklessly disregarded that Indivior was at a significant risk of, and/or was likely to, cease all sales and marketing activities related to PERSERIS; and (5) knew or recklessly disregarded that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Indivior class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/INDV CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) Class Period: November 29, 2023 - July 29, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike’s customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint.

Title: Elon Musk's X is the least-trusted Big Tech company, according to a survey — on par with the US government

Time Published: 2024-09-21T18:18:15Z

Americans think Elon Musk's X is as trustworthy as the US government. And that's not a compliment. A May survey published by All About Cookies, a company promoting digital security and online privacy, asked 1,000 US adults how much they trusted Big Tech and media companies compared to their government. EMARKETER, a market research company owned by Business Insider's parent company, shared the survey data on Friday. While companies like Amazon and Google topped the list, Musk's platform came in dead last. The survey's data showed that 70% of respondents trust Amazon, 65% trust Google, and 64% trust Netflix. Only 29% trusted TikTok, which ByteDance, a Chinese company, owns. US officials worry that ByteDance shares data with the Chinese government and have demanded it divest TikTok to an American-owned company or face a nationwide ban. Even fewer — only 28% of respondents — however, trusted X, the same percentage that trusted the US government. The survey showed that 43% of respondents distrusted the US government, while 44% distrusted X. Although the survey didn't clarify why respondents ranked X last on the list, the platform has been a magnet for controversy since Musk purchased Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, rebranded it, and overhauled how it moderates content. Musk conducted mass layoffs after taking control of Twitter, particularly among its trust and safety team, whose numbers dwindled from about 230 employees to about 20. More trust and safety staffers were laid off the following year. Yoel Roth, once the head of the trust and safety team, resigned from the company soon after Musk's arrival. Concerns about misinformation on the social media app grew quickly after Musk's purchase, so he launched Community Notes in 2022. A 2023 Bloomberg report said it analyzed almost 400 X posts that contained false information about the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza, however, and found that it typically took more than seven hours for a Community Note to appear, and some took 70 hours. Musk himself has faced backlash for his own questionable posts, including in 2023 when business leaders criticized him for amplifying an antisemitic post on X. He backtracked in January during a conference hosted by the European Jewish Association, saying he was "naive" about antisemitism and is "Jewish by association." Musk is now dealing with the fallout from another X post this month after former President Donald Trump survived a second apparent assassination attempt. Musk asked in the post why President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris haven't also faced similar threats. Musk's post immediately drew backlash for promoting political violence, prompting him to delete it and defend himself, calling it a "joke." The US Secret Service told Bloomberg News it is "aware" of Musk's post and is investigating the matter. Musk's X has also run afoul of multiple foreign governments, most recently in Brazil, where X lawyers on Friday finally capitulated to demands for stricter content moderation months after the country's Supreme Court ordered a nationwide ban of the platform. Representatives for X did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Jump to

Title: Market Lessons: 20 Companies With Dazzling Growth In Revenue Per Share
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2024/09/21/market-lessons-20-companies-with-dazzling-growth-in-revenue-per-share/
Time Published: 2024-09-21T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
Pornpimone Audkamkong/Getty Images W hat makes a growth stock? The first thing most investors look at is the earnings per share. But there’s a case to be made for giving equal attention to revenue growth. More precisely, you want companies whose revenue per share figure is growing at an impressive exponential rate. Winners on this score include such Wall Street favorites as Tesla, Block (the parent company of the Square payment network) and Meta Platforms (Facebook, that is). Ahead of them in the rankings are some less familiar names: Cheniere Energy, which exports liquified natural gas; Alnylam, a money-losing but very promising developer of RNA-based medicines, and MercadoLibre, a Latin American e-commerce platform whose shares see heavy trading on Nasdaq. Some smart investors have zeroed in on the top lines of companies. One was Charles Allmon (1921 – 2015), whose long-running Growth Stock Outlook newsletter included half a dozen stocks that appreciated more than 10,000% while on the recommended list. In an interview with Forbes on the occasion of his retirement at age 87, Allmon explained his philosophy. "In the long run a company cannot grow any faster than its sales," he said. "I look at sales first, earnings second and balance sheet third." Yes, earning growth matters a lot, and it’s scored in our review of earnings growers (see story list at bottom). But here we consider only revenue, not what companies get out of it. The sorting is by growth in revenue per share, since a boost in revenue made possible by a dilution of the share base doesn’t do much good for investors. Example: International Flavors & Fragrances, which makes chemicals for food and perfume aromas, looks pretty good in total revenue, better than tripling it over the past decade. But it has tripled its share count in that period. Its revenue per share growth comes in at an unimpressive 3% a year. Contrast that to Oracle Corporation, which sells software to maintain corporate databases. It is using its fount of profits to reduce the share count with buybacks. Thus, while Oracle’s total revenue has been growing at only a 3% rate, its revenue per share has been growing 10%. The analysis starts with 1,614 companies in the FactSet database that trade in the U.S., have market capitalizations over $1 billion and show revenue and shares outstanding numbers for at least 10 of the 12 years 2013-2024 (the last being a forecast). The long-term growth number is what comes out of an exponential fit to the revenue per share history. Predictability measures how closely that history tracks an exponential line (the statistician’s coefficient of determination), with a penalty for missing years. The top 10% of the group in predictability get the “Very High” label, the next 15% “High,” the next 15% “Above Average.” Among big companies with “Above Average” or better predictability, here are 20 standouts, with revenue per share growth between 22% and 58%: Not quite squeaking in are two names you expect to see: Amazon.com and Alphabet (i.e., Google). They both make the second ranking, however. This roster is limited to big companies with growth rates above 18% and Very High predictability: The final list is an assortment of revenue disappointments. It includes a woebegone utility (the former Pacific Gas & Electric), a good company in a shrinking industry (Artisan Partners, active management), a telephone company that wasn’t sure about diversifying into content (AT&T) and two greater-fool speculations (GameStop and AMC Entertainment). The revenue and share count statistics used as inputs come from FactSet, the price/earnings ratios from YCharts. Conclusions about growth rates are the author’s. The calculation uses a share count estimate for December 2024 that is an extrapolation of the recent trend in shares outstanding.

Title: Cory Doctorow at DEFCON: Disenshittify or Die

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Cory Doctorow, a renowned science fiction author and journalist, gave an enthralling speech at the recently concluded DEF CON. titled ‘DISENSHITTIFY OR DIE’. The word enshittification may seem alien to most people and it probably can’t be contained in a simpler definition. It is an entire process of exploiting end-users through a series of steps. Consider this: when the Internet first came into existence, the platforms were very simple. But is it the same now? A big NO, take Microsoft for example. Now, they allow you to use apps on the cloud, and track the features that are most important to you. They then take those features out of the basic package and sell them to you separately. This is called enshittification. The first step of this enshittification process starts with businesses appearing to be good to their end users. For example, Facebook shows you what you want to see, Uber charges less for cabs, and Amazon subsidizes goods and returns, and puts the best match of products at the top of the search results. However, there’s a hidden, more sinister part of stage one – locking in users. Now, there are several ways a platform can lock users in. Apple parts also use parts pairing, which is DRM handshakes between subcomponents and the main device, so that you cannot use third-party parts to fix a broken device. Plus, every part of the device has a microscopic Apple logo, so third-party parts are subject to trademark violation. Once businesses have locked users in, they start making things worse for users and better for themselves. For instance, platforms poison their search results with ads. Let’s take Amazon for example, who sells its search results, making $38 billion every year. And this costs a ton of money for businesses. Around 45% of the price of these products goes to Amazon. As a result, businesses have to increase the prices to make up for the lost margin. But that’s not the end. Amazon has a policy called the ‘Most Favoured Nation Status’ which means that the cheapest price they offer must be matched on Amazon. So what’s the solution? Businesses raise their prices everywhere – Target, Walmart, and your local shops. Similarly, Facebook poisons your feed too. It shows you less of the content from the people you follow and more of sponsored content and boosted posts. There’s an old adage that says “If you’re not paying for the product, then you’re the product”. However, Cory does not agree with this. Apple once offered a one-click option to opt out of app-based surveillance and 96% opted out. But now. Apple has turned on iOS spying, which collects users’ data for ad targeting with no option to opt out. So, even after paying $1,000 for the phone, you’re still the product. The same goes for Facebook’s ad business. This is the phase where businesses suck out all the utility from their products leaving users trapped. They do so through twiddling. With this, businesses alter the service backend to change its operations, costs, prices, search ranking, and other foundation aspects of the system. Digital platforms have made twiddling very easy. The same goes for YouTube videos. After spending thousands of dollars on a video, it is the algorithm that decides who watches them. In many cases, these videos don’t even reach the subscribers. However, there are some upsides to twiddling as well. Forbes’ Emily Baker White revealed that TikTok has a feature called the heating tool. When applied to a user’s account, this tool boosts videos from that particular creator, which reaches millions of users, irrespective of the recommendation algorithm. But why does TikTok do this? Let’s say TikTok wants more sports content on its platform. They randomly pick an account and heat it up so that the content gets a lot of traction. When other creators see this, they think that sports content is in trend and they start making similar content. And quite naturally, they do not get the traction similar to the first creator and they end up thinking that they’re missing something and doing TikTok wrong. The same thing goes for Uber drivers making $100,000 a year, sub-stackers rolling in dough, or Joe Rogan’s Spotify payout. The reason is pretty simple – the less value a business gives to suppliers, customers, and workers, the more value is left to be divided between the shareholders and executives. But, the real question is why NOW? Earlier there were consequences to enshittification. For example, companies like MySpace and Yahoo Search are down in the dumps, since they enshittified their products way too early. But now, there are no consequences of enshittification. Let’s explain the lack of consequences. There... (truncated)

Title: FedEx downgraded to hold, price target cut to $300
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/fedex-downgraded-to-hold-price-target-cut-to-300-93CH-3626211
Time Published: 2024-09-20T19:48:22Z
Full Content:
On Friday, HSBC adjusted its stance on FedEx (NYSE:FDX), shifting the rating from Buy to Hold and lowering the price target to $300 from the previous $350. The decision was influenced by revised earnings expectations, with the firm's forecast for fiscal year 2025 non-GAAP EBIT dropping by 8% to $6.8 billion. This figure falls 3% short of the company's guidance midpoint of $7.0 billion and is 4% below the consensus. The analyst from HSBC highlighted a decrease in projected volumes and yields as the primary reasons for the downgrade. Alongside the EBIT revision, the firm's forecast for non-GAAP EPS for fiscal year 2025 was also reduced by 6% to $20.09, which is 2% below the midpoint of guidance and consensus estimates. The target price adjustment reflects a lower target PE multiple of 15.1x, down from 16.6x. FedEx's stock performance was part of the evaluation, with a notable 21% rally year-to-date, mirroring the S&P 500's performance but outperforming its competitors. UPS's shares fell by 13%, and DHL's by 7% in the same period. The analyst pointed out that over the past two years, FedEx's share price has nearly doubled, increasing by 92.5% compared to a 20% decline for UPS and a 51% increase for the S&P 500. This surge in FedEx's stock was attributed to the success of its restructuring plan, which the analyst believes is now largely factored into the current share price. In other recent news, FedEx has experienced a series of adjustments following its first-quarter financial results for fiscal year 2025. The delivery giant reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.60, falling short of market expectations due to a shift in the types of shipments it handled. Despite these challenges, FedEx management has maintained a positive outlook, citing cost-saving measures and revenue management initiatives expected to increase sequentially throughout the year. Raymond James reduced its price target for FedEx to $310, while maintaining an Outperform rating, citing ongoing strategic initiatives such as the DRIVE program. TD Cowen reduced its price target to $328, but maintained a Buy rating, reflecting cautious optimism about FedEx's long-term potential. Jefferies, on the other hand, reduced its price target to $275, maintaining a Hold rating due to weaker than anticipated margins. Susquehanna lowered its price target for FedEx to $330, but maintained a Positive rating, expressing optimism for the company's potential rebound. Stifel also adjusted its price target for FedEx to $321, retaining a Buy rating despite the company's underperformance. As FedEx (NYSE:FDX) navigates through a period of recalibrated expectations, it's essential to consider the broader financial landscape and performance indicators that InvestingPro offers. The company boasts a market capitalization of $73.58 billion and trades at a P/E ratio of 17.26, which is noteworthy given the recent analyst downgrades and the high P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth. Despite the downward revisions, FedEx has a strong track record of maintaining dividend payments for 23 consecutive years, with a dividend yield of 1.85% as of the last twelve months leading up to Q4 2024. InvestingPro Tips highlight that FedEx has raised its dividend for three consecutive years and analysts predict the company will remain profitable this year, reinforcing its status as a prominent player in the Air Freight & Logistics industry. The company's stock has also shown resilience with a strong return over the last three months, boasting a 19.31% total return, and a solid performance over the last five years.

Title: Rates to plunge to 2.75pc next year, says HSBC
URL: https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/rates-plunge-2-75pc-next-172625383.html
Time Published: 2024-09-20T17:26:25Z
Full Content:
The Bank of England could cut interest rates to 2.75pc next year, analysts have suggested, amid growing confidence that the worst of Britain’s inflationary crisis is over. Policymakers are likely to cut interest rates at November’s meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and then again at every meeting next year from February, according to analysts from HSBC. It follows a decision by the Bank of England’s MPC earlier this week to keep rates on hold at 5pc. The Bank Rate had surged as high as 5.25pc following a series of rises over the past few years to try keep a lid on inflation. Last month, the Bank of England cut interest rates for the first time in four years. The analysts at HSBC said: “Part of the slightly better medium-term growth outlook reflects monetary policy. “With most indicators pointing to a cooling in the labour market, we and BoE have become more confident that the worst of the inflation pressures - and the risk of them becoming entrenched - is behind us. Given this, the current policy rate looks some way above neutral.” They said the latest statement from the Monetary Policy Committee suggested that rate setters were not in “the mood to move quickly”. However, the analysts said: “Given our own forecast that CPI inflation will rise back to 2.9pc by January next year (perhaps a touch above the Bank of England’s expectation), it might be February before the MPC has sufficient confidence for back-to-back rate cuts taking Bank Rate to 2.75pc in December next year.” HSBC suggested rates would then remain on hold throughout 2026.

You go to Sweden or to the Netherlands and you can hardly pay with a banknote - they send you off, bring your phone, don’t you have another way to pay?” The ECB President is looking into creating a central bank digital currency, but said citizens are worried about the privacy of the system. “The main concern people have is privacy - Big Brother is going to see where I spend my money,” she told an audience at the International Monetary Fund in Washington. “You know what, there are a few Big Brothers when you use your bank account or when you use other devices who know where you are spending your money, know what you are interested in and will send you instantly all those ads and nice proposals. “But the concern about the state - the assumption is the central bank will communicate all information collected to the state - will be privy to how you spend your money is something that is very very critical for citizens.” In her lecture to the IMF, Ms Lagarde warned that the inflation shock may not be a one-off. “If we enter an era where inflation is more volatile and monetary policy transmission more uncertain, maintaining this deep anchor for price formation will be essential,” she said, referring to the expectation among households and businesses that central banks will always raise interest rates to crush inflation. She also compared the 2020s to the 1920s, citing similarities including pandemics, a reversal of globalisation, and rapid technological progress. But she also raised the hope that central banks have learned their lesson from that era and should be able to avoid the “series of wrong turns” which tipped much of the world into the Great Depression. The Federal Reserve’s big interest rate cut this week is not a sign that the US economy is “falling behind,” Fed governor Christopher Waller said in an interview this afternoon. He told CNBC: It’s not about reacting to, or falling behind or anything like that. I do not believe we’re behind. Mr Waller was responding to arguments that the central bank should not do a half percentage point rate cut - instead opting for a smaller reduction - as this would be a sign of economic weakness. Citing a speech he made earlier this year, Mr Waller stressed that the Fed could cut rates even if the economy was doing fine. “And that’s the position we’re in,” he said, noting that inflation is cooling while the labour market remains solid. Central banks face a “difficult balancing act” as they start lowering interest rates around the world in the face of falling inflation, the head of the IMF said at an event this afternoon. Central banks on both sides of the Atlantic have cut rates this year, with the US Federal Reserve reducing its key lending rate by half a percentage point earlier this week in a bid to boost demand, following in the footsteps of the European Ce...

You can save as much as 50% on a fresh pair of sneakers with this week's best Hoka deals. In addition to landing a spot on our list of the best trail running shoes, we also named a Hoka style one of the best shoes for standing all day. Whether you’re a walker, runner or simply looking for a colorful pair of sneakers to complement your athleisure, these are the best Hoka deals available right now. Hoka This sneaker is our gear team’s pick for the best trail running shoe overall. It’s comfortable with tons of cushion and lighter than the previous iteration. This discount is only available in three colorways, but a solid range of sizes. Hoka If you’re not sold on the Speedgoat 5, check out the Torrent 3, on sale for 20% off. The style is also designed for trail running, featuring a durable outsole, low-profile cushioning and neutral support. You can shop three colors at the moment, but sizing is limited. REI Avid hikers will appreciate this boot’s ample cushioning and Hubble heel design (for smoother heel-to-toe movement). The shoe is also waterproof and has a more streamlined aesthetic than your classic hiking boot. This discount is currently available in the color pictured above. Hoka We named the Hoka Arahi 7, which is designed to keep your feet from overpronating, the best cushioned sneaker for arch support (as well as the best stability running shoe for men). This discount is only available in the pictured colorway, but most sizes are still in stock. Dick's Sporting Goods Designed to balance cushion with a streamlined silhouette, this lightweight shoe is great for racing and daily runs. Four colors are currently on sale—some for even less—but the pictured colorway has the widest range of sizes available.

Dick's Sporting Goods The sneaker has a thick lug sole that’s extra grippy on the pavement and great for trail running. If you like the blue-and-yellow colorway above, it’s currently on sale for 25% off when you add the shoe to your cart. (This style is also on sale in two other colorways directly from Hoka for a slightly lesser discount. ) Nordstrom Rack Designed for racers, the Carbon X 3 has a meta-rocker sole for extra propulsion and a neutral, streamlined fit. This deal is currently available in two colors, both with a solid array of sizes to choose from. Hoka rarely offers sitewide sales. That said, its sale section is often stocked with older designs for as much as 40% off. You can also typically find deals on Hoka sneakers from third-party retailers like REI and Dick’s Sporting Goods. Yes, select Hoka styles have been awarded the podiatric APMA Seal of Acceptance. This means podiatrists have reviewed the shoes and agreed that a number of Hoka’s cushioned designs are beneficial to overall foot health. Our editors named the Hoka Clifton 9 sneaker the best cushioned walking shoe for women and the best men’s walking shoe for flat feet. The style is plush and supportive without feeling overly bulky. But they won’t work for everyone—the best walking shoe for you depends on a variety of factors, including how high your arches are and how you walk. For instance, we recommend skipping the Hoka Clifton 9 if you have especially narrow feet. The brand recommends replacing your Hokas between 250 and 500 miles, depending on individual wear. Pay attention to signs like increased muscle fatigue, uneven wear patterns and discomfort to identify when it’s time to trade in an older pair. Hokas have been popularized online for their outstanding comfort and support. They have a super-plush midsole that helps with shock ab... (truncated)

Title: Amazon's return-to-office order bucks job flexibility trend
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/news/366611269/Amazons-return-to-office-order-bucks-job-flexibility-trend
Time Published: 2024-09-20T16:33:00Z
Full Content:
Getty Images/iStockphoto Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's recent return-to-office order might be more about staff reductions than improving watercooler brainstorming. His letter to employees talks about flattening the organization and having fewer managers. But that language raises suspicion among recruiting experts that the company wants to reduce headcount through attrition. If Amazon wants to reduce headcount, "this is an easy way to do it," said Julia Pollak, chief economist at online job marketplace ZipRecruiter, of the return-to-office mandate. It might cause natural attrition from workers unhappy with the order and help the company avoid mass layoffs, she said. "At the same time, you can always retain your superstar performers by negotiating exceptions for them on a one-on-one basis," Pollak said. But she also said it's possible Amazon had trouble running an effective remote work program. Despite Amazon's return-to-work order, flexible work arrangements have remained constant, according to ZipRecruiter's quarterly analysis of labor market changes. The current share of remote and hybrid job postings in the tech industry is above 20%, similar to 2021 data, Pollak said. "We don't see much pullback," she said. Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics, a telecommuting research and consulting firm, said she sees return-to-office mandates as being connected to staff reduction goals. "There's no doubt that AI will replace many of the types of jobs people do at places like Amazon," Lister said. "Even prior to the pandemic, hybrid work reversals were often a thinly disguised attempt to get people to quit, rather than having to lay them off." For employers, remote and hybrid work options will produce three times as many job applications compared with non-remote positions, Pollak said. When companies offer these options, attrition falls around 35%, she said. "Workers who work remotely are prepared to take an 8% pay cut because they value it so much," she said. There is little in job ad data that suggests Amazon's return-to-office order is a future of work trend. While there has been some pullback on fully remote jobs, at least in job listings, hybrid job ads are on the rise. Employer preference is shifting to hybrid work, according to data from WilsonHCG, a recruitment processing outsourcing provider. It has found that remote job postings account for 3.4% of all job postings in the U.S., or about 220,000 jobs, a decline ranging from 5% to 6% a year ago. But there has been a shift to hybrid ads, which is nearing 2% of all job postings, nearly double that from 18 to 24 months ago, according to the firm. What employers want is the ability to have workers on-site when needed, said Charles Faigle, executive vice president of talent solutions in the Americas at WilsonHCG. "It's all about flexibility within their workforce," he said. The workforce is also shifting in other ways. TalentNeuron, a labor market intelligence firm, said it is seeing a rise in the 40-hour, four-day workweek, according to an analysis of job postings. The job areas with the highest rise for this trend are medical and health, engineering, quality assurance, IT, administrative and clerical, and operations and logistics. "Many employees cite the four-day workweek as a primary incentive -- even over salary -- for the considerations around a role," said Erica Lee, a senior consultant at TalentNeuron. The firm identified, for instance, 103,000 job postings in the medical and health care field that explicitly mentioned a four-day workweek. These job ads represented less than 5% of the total current job ads, but the overall trend of the four-day workweek has increased more than 50% over the last several years. Dan Schwabel, managing partner at Workplace Intelligence, a research firm, said he sees a trend to tech employees losing remote work options, although it varies by companies. "Some tech companies continue to offer flexible or fully remote options to attract and retain talent," Schawbel said. "Smaller startups and certain tech roles may still provide more flexibility."

Title: Novo Nordisk stock tumbled over the latest results for its experimental weight loss pill
URL: https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-stock-monlunabant-weight-loss-trial-1851653608
Time Published: 2024-09-20T14:59:00Z
Full Content:
Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) announced mixed results today for a phase 2 trial of an experimental weight loss pill that works differently than its already-popular weight loss drug Wegovy. Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 6% during Friday morning trading after it posted the results. The Danish pharma giant tested monlunabant, a drug it acquired in 2023 with its $1 billion purchase of Inversago Pharma, in a phase 2 trial involving 243 participants with obesity and other related health complications. Monlunabant works by blocking CB1 receptors, which are found in the brain and nervous system and have an effect on appetite. Conversely, Wegovy works by mimicking a gut hormone that regulates blood sugar levels and reduces appetite. The new drug was tested in once-daily doses of 10mg, 20mg, and 50mg. Starting from an average weight of 110.1 kg (242.7 lbs), participants taking any dose of monlunabant lost significantly more weight than those on a placebo. After 16 weeks, people taking a daily 10 mg dose of monlunabant lost an average of 7.1 kg (15.6 lbs), or about 6% of their weight, while the placebo group only lost about 0.7 kg (1.5 lbs). Higher doses didn’t result in much more weight loss beyond that. In the trial, the most common side effects were digestive issues, which were generally mild to moderate and depended on the dose. People taking monlunabant also reported more mild-to-moderate mood-related side effects, including anxiety, irritability, and sleep problems, compared to those on a placebo. However, Novo Nordisk reported no severe neuropsychiatric side effects. “The phase 2a results indicate the weight-lowering potential of monlunabant and that further work is needed to determine the optimal dosing to balance safety and efficacy,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president and head of development at Novo Nordisk, in a statement. “Obesity is a complex disease with a significant unmet need, and as an oral small molecule having a new mechanism of action, monlunabant is one of the novel projects in our pipeline with the potential of treating obesity.” Novo Nordisk said it is plans to start a larger phase 2 trial of the drug in 2025.

Alliance Entertainment (AENT), a leader in direct-to-consumer and e-commerce in the entertainment sector, disclosed its financial outcomes for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 on [date]. The company reported a decrease in net revenue for Q4 to $236.9 million from $247.1 million the previous year, with a gross profit of $26.9 million. Despite the revenue dip, they saw an improvement in net income and a significant reduction in operating expenses, debt, and inventory levels. Management remains optimistic about future growth, highlighting strategies for cost savings, operational efficiencies, and revenue expansion through acquisitions and exclusive distribution deals. Alliance Entertainment's earnings call revealed a mixed financial performance with declines in revenue but improvements in net income and operational efficiencies. The company's management is confident in their growth strategy, which includes leveraging exclusive distribution rights and pursuing strategic acquisitions to boost revenue. They also anticipate cost savings from operational consolidations and technological investments. With these measures, Alliance Entertainment is positioning itself for a stronger performance in the coming fiscal years. Alliance Entertainment, with a market capitalization of $103.91 million, has been navigating a challenging fiscal period, as reflected in its latest financial results. The company's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q3 2024 stands at $1.11 billion, marking a decline of 5.62% from the previous year. Despite the dip in revenue, the firm's gross profit margin has remained relatively stable at 11.9%. InvestingPro Tips suggest that Alliance Entertainment has had a significant return over the last week, with a 12.83% price total return, and even more impressively, a 44.53% return over the last month. This indicates a recent surge in investor confidence, which may be tied to the company's strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions and exclusive distribution deals as outlined in their recent earnings call. Moreover, the company's valuation implies a strong free cash flow yield, which could be a sign of underlying financial health and potential for future profitability, as analysts predict the company will be profitable this year. Investors considering Alliance Entertainment should note that the stock generally trades with high price volatility, which could present opportunities for high-reward investments but also carries a greater risk. For those interested in a deeper analysis, there are 10 additional InvestingPro Tips available, offering further insights into the company's performance and investment potential. In summary, while Alliance Entertainment has faced revenue challenges, the company's recent price performance and the potential for improved profitability present an interesting case for investors.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: Monlunabant phase 2a trial in obesity successfully completed

Time Published: 2024-09-20T12:43:00Z
Full Content:
September 20, 2024 08:43 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 20 September 2024 – Novo Nordisk today announced headline results from a phase 2a clinical trial with monlunabant, a small molecule oral cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) inverse agonist. Monlunabant, formerly INV-202, was part of the acquisition of Inversago Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced in August 2023 [Link]. The trial investigated the efficacy and safety of a once-daily 10 mg, 20 mg and 50 mg dose of monlunabant compared to placebo on body weight after 16 weeks in 243 people with obesity and metabolic syndrome1. People were equally randomised among the four treatment arms. From a baseline body weight of 110.1 kg, all doses of monlunabant achieved a statistically significant weight loss compared to placebo. After 16 weeks of treatment, people treated with a once-daily 10 mg dose of monlunabant achieved a weight loss of 7.1 kg compared to a reduction of 0.7 kg with placebo2. Limited additional weight loss was seen at higher doses of monlunabant. In the trial, the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, with the vast majority being mild to moderate and dose dependent. Reporting of mild to moderate neuropsychiatric side effects, primarily anxiety, irritability, and sleep disturbances, was more frequent and dose dependent with monlunabant compared to placebo. No serious adverse events were reported in relation to neuropsychiatric side effects. “The phase 2a results indicate the weight-lowering potential of monlunabant and that further work is needed to determine the optimal dosing to balance safety and efficacy,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president and head of Development at Novo Nordisk. “Obesity is a complex disease with a significant unmet need, and as an oral small molecule having a new mechanism of action, monlunabant is one of the novel projects in our pipeline with the potential of treating obesity.” Based on the results, Novo Nordisk expects to initiate a larger phase 2b trial in obesity to further investigate dosing and the safety profile of monlunabant over a longer duration in a global population. The phase 2b trial is expected to be initiated in 2025. About monlunabant and CB1Monlunabant is an inverse agonist of the CB1 receptor which plays an important role in metabolism and appetite regulation in the central nervous system as well as in peripheral tissues such as adipose tissues, the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, pancreas, muscles and lungs. CB1 plays an important role in appetite regulation and cardiometabolic pathways. About Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark.

Title: FedEx stock target cut, retains hold rating on 1Q results

On Friday, Jefferies made an adjustment to its outlook on FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares, reducing the price target on the company's shares to $275 from the previous $300, while keeping a Hold rating on the stock. The adjustment follows FedEx's recent earnings report, which revealed first-quarter earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal year 2025 that fell more than 25% below market expectations. This shortfall was attributed to weaker than anticipated margins in both the Federal Express and Freight segments. According to the financial firm, FedEx's adjusted operating profit saw a year-over-year decline of $380 million, or 24%. This significant drop was noted even though FedEx had realized $1.8 billion in cost savings last year from its DRIVE initiative. The DRIVE program was designed to increase efficiency and reduce operational costs across the company's various business units. The analysis further highlighted that the margin for the Federal Express segment was at its lowest since the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. The anticipated pressure on the second quarter's performance and a 20% downward revision of first-half EPS estimates have led to skepticism about FedEx's ability to meet the lower end of its EPS guidance for the year. The report from Jefferies suggests caution, indicating that the upcoming second quarter could present additional challenges for FedEx. The company's financial performance in the first half of the fiscal year has prompted a reassessment of its earnings potential, leading to the revised price target. Despite the cost-saving measures implemented by FedEx, the current financial results have not met the expectations set by previous forecasts. In other recent news, FedEx's financial performance has been the subject of various adjustments by financial firms. Susquehanna cut its price target for FedEx to $330, while maintaining a positive rating, following the company's first-quarter results for fiscal year 2025, which missed expectations with an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.60. Similarly, Stifel revised its price target for FedEx to $321 from $327, maintaining a buy rating despite the company's underperformance. Baird also adjusted its price target for FedEx, reducing it to $320 from $340, but retained an outperform rating. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley downgraded FedEx stock from Equalweight to Underweight, reducing the price target to $200, citing FedEx's forecasted EPS for fiscal year 2025 as significantly below the guidance provided by FedEx's management. FedEx's first-quarter results showed a shift in the types of shipments it handled, impacting the company's blended yield and leading to higher costs associated with purchased transportation. However, the company's management indicated that cost savings are expected to increase sequentially throughout the year, with revenue management initiatives in place to mitigate the pressure on yields. FedEx is implementing the 'DRIVE' initiative as part of its restructuring plan, aimed at reducing costs and enhancing operational efficiency. These are all recent developments for FedEx, providing insights into the company's performance and strategic initiatives. Following Jefferies' revision of FedEx's price target, it's pertinent to consider additional insights from InvestingPro to gauge the company's financial health and market position. According to InvestingPro data, FedEx's market capitalization stands at $73.58 billion, with a P/E ratio of 17.26, indicating investor sentiment on its earnings potential. The company has experienced a revenue decline over the last twelve months as of Q4 2024, with a -2.73% change, yet it maintains a strong gross profit margin of 27.32%. InvestingPro Tips highlight that FedEx has consistently raised its dividend for the last three years and has maintained dividend payments for 23 consecutive years, showcasing its commitment to returning value to shareholders. Moreover, FedEx has shown a strong return over the last three months, with a price total return of 19.31%, and analysts predict the company will remain profitable this year. These factors underscore FedEx's resilience and the potential for long-term investor confidence. For those seeking further insights, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available, which provide deeper analysis into FedEx's performance and future outlook (https://www.investing.com/pro/FDX). These tips may offer valuable perspectives for investors considering FedEx's stock amidst the current market conditions. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Title: Why Did FedEx Stock Fall 13%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/20/why-did-fedex-stock-fall-13/

FedEx truck is seen in New York City, United States on July 16, 2024. (Photo by Jakub ... [+] Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) FedEx stock (NYSE: FDX) saw a 13% fall in after-market hours on Thursday, September 19, after it reported Q1’25 results (fiscal ends in May) far worse than the street estimates. FDX stock is up 7% year-to-date, compared to -15% returns for its peer – UPS stock. FedEx reported revenue of $21.6 billion and adjusted earnings of $3.60 per share, well below our estimates of $22.1 billion, and $4.90, respectively. The company’s results were also lower than the consensus estimates of $22.0 billion and $4.83, respectively. Not only did FedEx report a downbeat quarter, it cut its full-year outlook, weighing on its stock. Overall, the performance of FDX stock with respect to the index has been quite volatile in recent years. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could FDX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? We now estimate FedEx’s Valuation to be $285 per share, reflecting just 9% upside from its levels of around $260. Our forecast is based on a 14x forward expected adjusted earnings of $20.85, broadly aligning with the stock’s average P/E ratio over the last five years. FedEx’s Revenue fell 0.5% y-o-y to $21.6 billion in Q1, due to lower express and freight segment sales. The average daily volume was flat y-o-y for the express segment, but the average daily shipments were down 3% for the freight segment. FedEx also saw its adjusted operating margin contract by 170 bps to 5.6% in Q1’25. This resulted in its bottom line of $3.60 on an adjusted basis, down 21% y-o-y. This dismal performance by FedEx can be attributed to continued weakness in shipping demand. With continued price increases, consumers have become more cautious and are opting for lower priced services. FedEx will also lose the U.S. Postal Service as its client, likely resulting in around a $500 million headwind for the company. Looking forward, FedEx expects a low single-digit rise in total revenues for fiscal 2025, slightly more cautious than its prior outlook of a low to mid-single-digit rise. Although, its focus on cost-cutting initiatives should bode well for the bottom-line growth. FedEx is in the midst of its $4 billion cost-saving efforts by the end of fiscal 2025. Still, it lowered its earnings outlook to now be in the range of $20 and $21 per share, versus $20 and $22 per share earlier. We now forecast the 2025 revenue to be around $89.7 billion, reflecting a 2% y-o-y rise, and adjusted earnings to be $20.85, versus $17.80 in fiscal 2024. While FedEx will likely benefit from its focus on improving margins, the company faces headwinds amid soft demand, which may continue to weigh on its stock performance in the near term. While FDX stock posted a downbeat Q1, it is helpful to see how FedEx’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Title: Tech job seekers face hard times as industry resets

The big picture: For decades, having a job in tech meant stability, regular raises, and lucrative perks. However, that has changed, perhaps permanently. The tech labor market is currently in upheaval, with firms letting go of employees by the thousands and tightening hiring requirements when they are looking to fill positions. The only safe space appears to be in AI. Since the start of the year, more than 137,500 employees have been laid off from 438 tech companies, according to Layoffs.fyi. Meanwhile, postings for software development jobs have declined by over 30 percent since February 2020, according to Indeed.com. Companies across the industry spectrum are cutting tech positions, including some of the largest names in the game. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have all downsized this year, along with eBay, Unity Software, SAP, Intel, PayPal, and Cisco. Furthermore, employees who still have jobs are experiencing stagnant wage growth, according to Pequity, a compensation-planning startup. Wages have increased by an average of just 0.95 percent in 2024 compared to last year. This is not new information for those in the industry seeking employment. Last year, over 260,000 workers across nearly 1,200 tech companies lost their jobs, making 2023 the second-largest year of layoffs on record in the technology sector, behind only the dot-com crash in 2001, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. "The market isn't what it once was," Roger Lee, creator of Layoffs.fyi, told CNBC. "To secure a new position, many salespeople and recruiters are leaving tech entirely. Even engineers are compromising – accepting roles with less stability, a tougher work environment, or lower pay and benefits." The trend doesn't appear to be part of the typical cyclical fluctuations that characterize tech employment, either. The Wall Street Journal recently referred to it as a fundamental reset in an industry that is readjusting its labor needs. Instead of focusing on growth at all costs, companies are now zeroing in on revenue-generating products and services in their hiring strategies. This shift means that sectors that weren't very profitable, such as virtual reality and devices, are facing significant cuts. Tech firms are also scaling back on entry-level hires and eliminating recruiting teams. Companies that are hiring are now looking for engineers with a broader skill set, including collaboration abilities and a working knowledge of the company's AI strategy. Ryan Sutton, executive director of the technology practice group at staffing firm Robert Half, told The Wall Street Journal, "They want to see people who are more versatile." AI is one of the few areas experiencing growth, perhaps not surprisingly. Individuals who have worked on large language models can easily find jobs with salaries reaching $1 million a year. AI engineers are being offered two to four times the salary of a regular engineer, according to Pequity CEO Kaitlyn Knopp. "That's an extreme investment of an unknown technology," she said. "They cannot afford to invest in other talent because of that." Tech workers may understandably feel a sense of whiplash from these changes. During the pandemic, firms went on a hiring spree as much of everyday life moved online. Employees were offered generous salaries and significant flexibility as companies competed for talent. Then the economy cooled amid higher interest rates and inflation, leading to large-scale layoffs as companies jettisoned tens of thousands of jobs. However, the current hiring trends are not as closely correlated to the economy as one might think. Nela Richardson, head of ADP Research, told The Wall Street Journal that the past few years represent the natural trajectory of an industry grounded in innovation. "You're not breaking as much new ground in terms of the digital space as in earlier time periods," she said. TECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, Gamers TechSpot is a registered trademark.

Title: Are Europe’s Too-Big-To-Fail Banks About to Get Even Bigger?
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2024/09/are-europes-too-big-to-fail-banks-about-to-get-even-bigger.html
Time Published: 2024-09-20T10:45:44Z
Full Content:
As two potential big bank mergers — both hostile, one cross-border — hang in the balance, Mario Draghi and the editorial boards of the FT and Bloomberg call for a fresh round of European bank consolidation. The last time two large banks merged in Europe was in March 2023, when a reluctant UBS took over its failing domestic rival, Credit Suisse. The fast-moving fallout from the bank collapses in the US had tipped the chronically mismanaged Credit Suisse over the edge. The resulting shotgun merger was Europe’s first ever tie-up between two officially Too-Big-to-Fail lenders, and while it may have steadied the ship, for now, it also served as a timely reminder that, to quote Satyajit Das, strong capital and liquidity ratios count for little when panicked depositors take flight. Fast forward to today, two proposed bank mergers — both hostile, one cross-border — hang in the balance. In the first, Italy’s second largest bank, Unicredit, is looking to take over Germany’s second largest, Commerzbank. Both lenders were in dire straits just a few years ago, with Unicredit even losing its status as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), but appear to have more or less stabilised since then. In the second, Spain’s second largest bank, BBVA, seeks to buy out its domestic rival, Banco Sabadell. Thinning the Herd Both mergers have been tried before, with no success, but that doesn’t prevent them from being tried again. In the case of BBVA’s proposed takeover of Sabadell, it faces strong opposition from the national government in Madrid, but it has received the blessing of the European Central Bank, which has long favoured thinning the herd of banking players in the Euro Area. For its part, Unicredit has solicited ECB approval to own up to 30% of Commerzbank, potentially triggering a full buyout deal. The answer from the ECB is likely to be “yes”. Senior ECB representatives have persistently sought to reduce the number of small and mid-sized banks in the Euro Area. In September 2017, Daniele Nouy, the then-Chair of the ECB’s Supervisory Board, partly blamed the low profitability of large lenders on the fierce competition from smaller banks. Rather than lots of competition between domestic banks, what Europe needs, Nouy said, are “brave banks” that are willing to traverse borders and conquer new territory. Current ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos recently reiterated this position: “We are looking for an integrated European market, we lack the single deposit guarantee fund, which we are in favour of. And I think that the less cracked and fragmented the system is, in terms of national barriers, the more economies of scale can increase, boosting competition. Having large European banks is a fundamental part of this. European integration is stagnant and I think this would help spur it along.” It may just do that, but the consequences are likely to be dire for Europe’s sclerotic economies. As the German economist and small bank activist Richard Werner warns, economies with fewer and bigger banks will lend less and less to small firms, which tends to mean that productive credit creation that produces jobs, prosperity and no inflation, also declines, and credit creation for asset purchases, causing asset bubbles, or credit creation for consumption, causing inflation, become more dominant.” In other words, more financialisation, less productive activity. In the eurozone, more than 5,000 banks have already disappeared since the ECB started business a little over two decades ago, according to Werner. And the central bank is determined to continue, if not intensify, this process. In his recent report for the Commission on the state of EU competitiveness, former ECB Governor Mario Draghi blames European banks’ lower profitability and lending capacity vis-a-vis their US counterparts on their lack of scale. And the main reason for that lack of scale, he says, is “the [EU’s] incomplete Banking Union.” The document argues that “a minimal step towards completing the Banking Union would be to create a separate jurisdiction for European banks with substantial cross-border operations that would be ‘country blind’ from the regulatory, supervisory and crisis management viewpoints.” In other words, a partial banking union for the EU’s largest cross-border lenders. According to Bloomberg columnist Paul j Davies, “It’s a minimal reform that would need single, EU-level deposit insurance and resolution schemes for just the top 20 or so lenders”. The idea already enjoys the full-throated support of Bloomberg and the FT. In an op-ed on Wednesday, Bloomberg‘s editorial board averred that “UniCredit’s Takeover Bid Should Be Welcomed by Europe.” Such a merger, they claim, could pave the way to “the financial union both Germany and Europe desperately need,” creating a bank that will be among the largest on the continent, with a bigger balance sheet and domestic revenues than Deutsche bank. Faced with such a threat, Deutsche Bank has threatened to ... (truncated)

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / SEPTEMBER 20 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroecono... (truncated)

Amazon's prestige push, China's slowdown and the rise of TikTok are all factors at play. Senior Editor, Beauty As the beauty landscape shape shifts around the world — Amazon ascendant, China decelerating, TikTok dominating and new consumers emerging — the beauty jobs market is evolving accordingly. Companies both established and emerging are reconfiguring their workforces to better meet the demands of these fast-changing times, whether reshaping certain departments, opting for more agility with a fractional model or restructuring. “The bottom line is simplify to amplify,” said Oliver Chen, an analyst at TD Cowen. “Part of that is managing for speed and agility.” Related Articles Beauty Features Literary Manicures? Meditative Manicures? Kure Bazaar Will Host Them in Its Paris 'Home' Beauty The 40 Best TikTok Beauty Products, Tested by Editors For many larger players, this changing landscape involves some component of restructuring, with layoffs in certain areas of the business even as others are enhanced. “The intention is to maximize profitability, given the China slowdown, and also even just a touch of overall slowdown in this market as well,” said Cassie Cowman, a cofounder of View From 32, a beauty consultancy that works with both founders and investors. “Companies are figuring out how to structure these teams to maximize that,” she added. “I have some clients that are still seeing decent traffic, for example, but the conversion is very low or maybe the dot-com channel is suffering. So, how are they investing more in the brick-and-mortar business to maximize that channel while it’s seeing strong momentum?” Unilever has unveiled a “comprehensive productivity program,” involving 7,500 office-based layoffs globally to achieve total cost savings of around 800 million euros over the next three years. British media outlets have reported that, as part of the layoff plan, it is set to cut a third of all office roles in Europe by the end of 2025, or around 3,200 roles. In February, The Estée Lauder Cos. revealed a restructuring plan, including layoffs, as it continues to tread water amid struggles in Asia and at home. It’s part of the wider Profit Recovery and Growth Plan, designed to make the company more agile. The owner of Clinique, Mac, Tom Ford and others will reduce its 62,000-strong global workforce by between 3 and 5 percent as part of the plan, the equivalent of as many as 3,100 jobs. This will be carried out over the next two-and-a-half years. That same month, Shiseido introduced a new business plan within which it is offering an early retirement plan to approximately 1,500 employees in Japan to help bolster group growth and profitability. The move is part of an overarching vision. “To achieve sustainable growth, Shiseido Japan will concentrate its activities on brands, products and touchpoints with high growth potential and profitability, strengthening brand and touchpoint strategy,” the company said. Dyson is also cutting around 1,000 jobs in the U.K., roughly one-third of its U.K. workforce, due to what the company has described as “fierce” global competition. At L’Oréal U.S., WWD understands that there has been some restructuring in the consumer products division, resulting in around 40 job losses. These are omni shopper roles, the link between the marketing and sales teams. Sales leads for brands are also being moved to retail leads. In a WARN notice filed in New York last month, No7 Beauty company said that 64 workers at its Manhattan office would be affected by an office closure. “To enhance our ability to invest in the growth of No7 Beauty Company in the U.S., we are restructuring our organization to work more closely within our own retail partners,” said a spokesman. “Moving forward, we will no longer occupy a small number of desks in a shared office space in New York, and most of our team members are being relocated.” Its parent company Walgreens Boots Alliance has made several rounds of layoffs. Most recently, LVMH-owed Sephora announced plans to cut its workforce in China by 3 percent, the equivalent to around 120 roles, “in response to the challenging market environment” there. As for what roles companies are hiring, Lisa Mare Ringus, executive vice president of global client strategy and growth at 24 Seven Inc, noted that there has been interest in specific sales roles such as supporting Amazon, social and content, finance and marketing. “We’ve seen more hiring in finance this year than ever before within beauty,” Ringus said. Others have seen a spike in searches for brand chief merchandising officers, as well as sales chiefs and chief commercial officers, also sometimes called chief revenue officers. And of course, those with knowledge of AI and TikTok are increasingly in demand. “It’s also about the new skill set,” said Chen. “When you hire someone they’re going to be much better at AI and use TikTok regularly. You need new people who can engage new customers.” In addition to the strateg... (truncated)

Title: Amazon’s RTO mandate likely to boomerang, other companies ‘should not follow suit’

Beginning with the new year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wants his employees back in the office five days a week, returning to an office routine that was common before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the workplace. The backlash from employees was nearly instantaneous, as they berated Jassy — and the return-to-work policy — and vowed to quit. Others demanded raises in exchange for in-office work requirements. Industry analysts were not surprised by the reaction, and said back-to-office mandates more often than not have the exact opposite effect as intended. According to the employee memo released this week, Jassy believes being back in the office will help boost employee training, bolster collaboration, and strengthen culture. “If anything, the last 15 months we’ve been back in the office at least three days a week has strengthened our conviction about the benefits,” Jassy wrote. “We understand that some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments. To help ensure a smooth transition, we’re going to make this new expectation active on January 2, 2025.” In fact, a study performed in May indicated mandatory return-to-office (RTO) policies could lead to higher quit rates compared with companies that allow remote or hybrid work. The study by the University of Michigan and University of Chicago found that three large US tech companies — Microsoft, Apple and SpaceX — saw substantially increased attrition, particularly among more senior personnel, when they implemented strict return-to-work policies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Forcing employees to quit, however, might be exactly what Amazon wants, according to J. P. Gownder, a vice president analyst with Forrester Research. “There is a chance that Amazon is hoping to induce a level of voluntary attrition with this move in lieu of layoffs. Unfortunately, the best talent often has choices, and most don’t want to work in an office five days a week,” Gownder said. In his memo, Jassy also outlined a plan to reduce managers, saying that “will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today. If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership,” he wrote. Amazon’s mandate puts the company in the minority, according to recent research. Among employees with jobs that can be done remotely, 43% work hybrid, 22% work fully remote, and 35% work in the office full time. “Amazon’s decision may just compromise its promise to be ‘Earth’s best employer,’” said Gownder. “The macro data shows that pre-pandemic nostalgia is not a post-pandemic reality. Other companies should not follow suit.” Abandoning hybrid work policies will negatively affect employee experience — particularly recruiting, retention, and diversity — impacting productivity and, potentially, the bottom line, according to Gownder. A Gartner Research study released this month showed 47% of HR leaders are concerned about employee resentment toward their organization. They see change fatigue (70%), return to office mandates (62%), and lack of career growth opportunities (58%) as the biggest drivers of employee unhappiness. Two other Gartner studies this year showed high-performing employees, women and millennials would be the greatest flight risks when strict RTO policies are implemented. (One in three executives handed a RTO mandate would quit, one of those studies showed.) “Mandated on-site requirements can carry very steep costs for talent attraction and retention. This is especially true for high-performers, women and millennials — three employee segments who greatly value flexibility,” said Caitlin Duffy, a director in the Gartner HR practice. “Often, these costs far outweigh the moderate benefits to employee engagement and effort.” Instead of office mandates, flexible hybrid work policies are the gold standard, research has shown. According to a Stanford University study, only 17.6% of employees who can work from home say they want to work in an office five days a week. A June study by McKinsey & Co. showed organizations where employees work in multiple locations (at home, in the office, or at client sites) are more likely to see 10% or greater revenue growth than companies where employees work from a single location. Another McKinsey study revealed that employees consistently point to greater productivity and reduced burnout as primary benefits of flexible work policies. Flexibility is especially important to women, who report having more focused time to work when working remotely, the study showed. William Hatcher, a professor of public administration and chair of social sciences at Augusta University in Georgia, said research is clear that “individuals are more productive at their jobs when they have more control over their schedules.” “Workplaces that empower employees with flexible scheduling policies and te...

September 19, 2024 12:43 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On September 12, 2024, SEMAFOR reported that software engineers at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike “complained about rushed deadlines, excessive workloads, and increasing technical problems to higher-ups for more than a year before a catastrophic failure of its software paralyzed airlines and knocked banking and other services offline for hours.” Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 29, 2023 – July 29, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Sept. 30, 2024Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/CRWD Contact the Firm Now: CRWD@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Securities Class Action Against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): According to the September 12, 2024 reporting by SEMAFOR, in the wake of CrowdStrike’s disastrous update to its flagship Falcon Sensor security product that contained a bug that caused a massive overnight outage affecting 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, a certain former employee said “‘[s]peed was the most important thing’” and “‘[q]uality control was not really part of our process or conversation.’” The SEMAFOR article, “CrowdStrike ex employees: ‘Quality control was not part of our process,’” states “[a]lmost two dozen former software engineers, managers, managers and other staff described a workplace where executives prioritized speed over quality, workers weren’t always sufficiently trained, and mistakes around coding and other tasks were rising.” SEMAFOR also reported that “[o]ne former senior manager said they sat in multiple meetings where staff warned company leaders that CrowdStrike would ‘fail’ its customers by releasing products that couldn’t be supported.” The pending litigation focuses on the propriety of CrowdStrike’s representations concerning the efficacy of its AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon platform, including assurances that its technology was “validated, certified, and tested.” The complaint alleges that CrowdStrike’s assurances were false and misleading because the company failed to disclose that: (1) it instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to the company. The company’s assurances came into question beginning on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called “the blue screen of death.” The news was accompanied by several analyst downgrades with one at Guggenheim downgrading CrowdStrike from buy to neutral, reportedly writing that “[t]he restoration of its reputation may take more time and will likely affect new business signings at least in the near-term.” Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike’s customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down $84.24 (-24%) since July 18, 2024.

Title: Forget Amazon, This Stock Has 85% Market Share And 2x Upside

06 February 2024, Rhineland-Palatinate, Mainz: A police commissioner holds a Taser on the sidelines ... [+] of the presentation of the new police law in the courtyard of the Ministry of the Interior. Photo: Arne Dedert/dpa (Photo by Arne Dedert/picture alliance via Getty Images) Axon Enterprise stock (NASDAQ: AXON) has had a solid run, rising by almost 3x over the past two years from levels of about $124 per share in September 2022 to about $380 presently. There is a high probability that this run is unlikely to lose steam anytime soon, for this run is backed by solid business performance. For context, Axon Enterprise is a tech company and it has 85% market share in one of its products viz. body cameras that the company sells to police departments in all the major American cities. While market share in only one product should not be the only focus, the fact that the company has witnessed surging demand across its services/product lines, right from cloud services, to solutions for drones and body cameras, indicates that the company must be doing something special. For context, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) has that kind of market share in search, while Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) does not have that in e-commerce. Consequently, barring small fluctuations, Axon’s stock price movement has largely been one-sided since reaching a temporary low below $100 back in June 2022. The stock has gained a solid 48% YTD and has comfortably outperformed its peers in the aerospace and defense industry, viz. Textron (NYSE: TXT), up 8%, Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE: HII), down 1%, and Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: SPR), up 10%, in this period. Has the peak been reached? At the current price level, Axon Enterprise stock trades at about 100x trailing earnings and 16x its trailing revenues. Is this a reasonable multiple? Possibly yes! Especially if you consider the fact that the company’s revenues have the potential to grow by more than 30% annually in the next few years. Over the last few years, the company has consistently reported strong revenue growth with an average growth of 30% in the last 5 years and the trend is not likely to reverse anytime soon. Moreover, the company’s net margin has witnessed a significant improvement in the last couple of years to reach over 10%. We outline a path for the stock to rise to levels of about $1000 per share in the next few years by looking at the company’s potential revenue growth, net margins, and its price-to-earnings multiple on the back of a strong sales pipeline, which has grown across product categories and customer verticals. AXON Has Done It In The Past AXON stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 28% in 2021, 6% in 2022, and 56% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could AXON see a strong jump? Revenue growth coupled with margin expansion is the key Axon reports its revenues under two segments – TASER, which includes sales of its conducted energy devices (CEDs), batteries, accessories and extended warranties, and Software & Sensors – which includes integrated hardware and cloud-based software solutions for law enforcement. These segments accounted for 39% and 61% of the company’s total sales last year. While the TASER segment sales have risen 40% between 2021 and 2023, the Software & Sensors segment sales have surged over 2x over this period. Now, the company is focused on improving its recurring revenues from its cloud-based solutions. The recurring revenues have been rising at a fast pace from $327 million in 2021 to $732 million in 2023, and $850 million as of June 30, 2024. The overall increase in public safety spending clubbed with the increasing reliance on recurring revenues will likely propel the company to see meaningful growth in sales over the next few years. With an increasing scale of operations, AXON is also expected to steadily improve its business margins due to higher absorption of its fixed overheads, which in turn would result in net income increasing by a steady rate. Consequently, if AXON’s revenues grow by about 2.5x between FY’24 and FY’27, with margins expanding by about 1.5x over the same period, this would imply that earnings can grow by around 3.8x. Now if earnings grow 3.8x, the P/E multiple will shrink to less than a third of its current level, assuming the stock price stays the same. But that’s exactly what Axon Enterprise’s investors are betting will not happen! If earnings expand 3.8x over the next few years, instead of the P/E shrinking from around 100x presentl... (truncated)

Title: China Giving Musk A Bloody Nose?

BEIJING, CHINA - SEPTEMBER 16, 2024 - Visitors visit the booth of Tesla at the 2024 China Beijing ... [+] International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) in Beijing, China, September 16, 2024. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) China has emerged as the biggest growth market for electric vehicles (EVs), with nearly a third of all vehicles sold in the country being electric, compared to less than 10% in the U.S. However, EV bellwether Tesla faces considerable challenges from Chinese EV makers who are rapidly gaining ground. Although China remains Tesla’s largest market outside the U.S., Tesla’s recent performance in the country has been underwhelming. From January to August, Tesla delivered about 388,000 vehicles in China, largely flat compared to the previous year. This contrasts sharply with the broader Chinese EV market, which is expected to grow by close to 30% this year, suggesting that Tesla is losing market share. Tesla’s share of the Chinese New Energy Vehicles market—which includes plug-in hybrids, fuel cell vehicles, and battery electric vehicles—fell from 9% to 6.5% in the first seven months of this year, according to Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility. More broadly, the rise of Chinese EV makers threatens Tesla’s position not only in China but globally. With a mixed performance in China and the overall slowdown in the global EV market, the performance of TSLA stock with respect to the index over the last 3-year period has been quite volatile. Returns for the stock were 50% in 2021, -65% in 2022, and 102% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. There are over 100 EV brands in China that cover a broad range of the EV spectrum. Several premium models from the likes of Nio and Li Auto - which offer high-tech interiors and range extender generators - go head to head with Tesla’s offerings such as the Model Y and 3. Moreover, Chinese automakers have also been able to churn out compelling vehicles priced at as low as $10,000 to 15,000. In essence, they’ve done what Musk and Tesla have only dreamed about but have been unable to deliver. China has the advantage of having a massive EV ecosystem- that spans from motors and drivetrains to battery manufacturing and increasingly compelling software engineering and semiconductor competence. Given the rising competitive pressures in the EV market, should you Drop Tesla and pick these AI and auto component stocks As Chinese competitors strengthen, another question arises: Could they not only surpass Tesla in EV sales but also dominate the future of autonomous driving? Tesla has thus far been viewed as a leader in developing self-driving technology. The company’s vehicles have logged a total of 1.6 billion miles with its full-self driving software engaged, giving its machine-learning algorithms considerable strength. However, this may not be enough given that Tesla is losing out in the Chinese autonomous driving market. Tesla is facing delays in rolling out its Full Self-Driving software in China as local regulators have not authorized the technology yet, citing worries about accidents involving Tesla’s software in the U.S. and also due to potential data security issues. Separately, Tesla hasn’t been permitted to transfer driving data from China to the U.S. to train its self-driving models. Chinese carmakers, on the other hand, have government approval and offer more advanced driver-assistance features compared to what Tesla is presently allowed to equip its vehicles within the Chinese market. This could put the company at a handicap. On the other hand, with their low prices, innovative designs, and luxury features, the Chinese could put more cars on the road and potentially improve their competence in the autonomous vehicle space where data is king. More cars on the road means more self-driving miles, more data, and more learning - could that help Chinese EV makers open an insurmountable lead in driverless cars that would mean they’d gain even more share over the auto industry much as the Japanese - Toyota, and Honda - did 40 years ago. In addition, more scale will mean even more economies of scale and that is just how the automotive industry has been. Did you know that Tesla has a fast-growing Clean Energy business. Could It help derisk the company’s auto business? Despite the growing dominance of Chinese EV makers, Tesla has a couple of advantages that could help it navigate these challenges. Tesla continues to benefit from its manufacturing footprint in China. Tesla’s Shanghai is the largest, boasting the capacity to produce over 950,000 Model 3 and Model Y cars annually. By comparison, Tes... (truncated)

Title: BofA bullish on CrowdStrike stock despite near-term nnARR and cash flow pressures

Time Published: 2024-09-19T10:23:35Z
Full Content:
On Thursday, BofA Securities expressed a continued positive outlook on CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock, maintaining a Buy rating and a price target of $365.00. The firm highlighted CrowdStrike's strategic initiatives aimed at accelerating growth, including the Falcon Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) program and newly introduced vendor financing options. The company's efforts to drive growth through product and go-to-market strategies were acknowledged, with the expectation that these would sustain the company's growth momentum. Despite potential short-term impacts, such as pressure on Net-new Annual Recurring Revenue (nnARR) growth and cash flow due to incentives like discounting and extended contract terms, BofA Securities anticipates these measures to foster broader platform adoption and enhance customer retention over time. The analyst noted that the impact of vendor financing on free cash flow (FCF) is anticipated to diminish as the financing programs reach their one-year mark. The firm's endorsement of the Buy rating is rooted in CrowdStrike's product leadership, attractive growth prospects, and the potential for total addressable market (TAM) expansion. CrowdStrike's strategic actions, including discounting and contract elongation, are seen as incentives that could potentially affect nnARR growth and cash flow in the near term. However, these initiatives are also viewed as catalysts for long-term platform adoption and customer loyalty. In summary, BofA Securities reaffirms its confidence in CrowdStrike's market position and future prospects, emphasizing the company's strong product offerings and the opportunities for market growth. The firm's maintained Buy rating and price target reflect a steady belief in CrowdStrike's continued success in its sector. In other recent news, CrowdStrike Holdings has been making notable strides in its operational and financial performance. The cybersecurity firm exceeded expectations in its second fiscal quarter with annual recurring revenue, revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share. However, guidance for the third fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2025 fell short of consensus estimates, leading to adjustments from various analyst firms including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and Deutsche Bank. CrowdStrike has also announced several strategic initiatives, such as the launch of a new Financial Services arm to facilitate easier terms and access to its Falcon platform. Additionally, it has established partnerships with Dazz and 1Password to enhance cloud security measures and simplify security for small and midsize businesses. The company also appointed Kartik Shahani as the Vice President of India and SAARC to expand its reach in the region. Mizuho Securities, DA Davidson, and Citi have all maintained positive ratings on CrowdStrike, citing the company's unique cloud security platform, superior go-to-market strategy, and success in expanding beyond traditional endpoint security markets. These recent developments reflect CrowdStrike's commitment to maintaining healthy financials and robust security offerings. In light of BofA Securities' optimistic stance on CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD), recent data from InvestingPro shows that the company holds a substantial market capitalization of $65.48 billion, signaling strong investor confidence. This is further bolstered by a significant revenue growth rate over the last twelve months, coming in at 33.07%, which underscores the company's robust growth trajectory as highlighted by BofA Securities. While the company's P/E ratio stands at a high 382.02, indicating a premium valuation, this is reflective of CrowdStrike's strong market position and growth potential. The high price/book ratio of 22.95 also suggests that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's assets and future growth prospects. An InvestingPro Tip to note is that CrowdStrike is expected to be profitable this year, aligning with the positive outlook presented by BofA Securities. For investors seeking a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers additional insights, including 39 analysts having revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, potentially providing a more conservative outlook on the company's near-term performance. Moreover, there are 15 more InvestingPro Tips available for CrowdStrike, which can be accessed for those looking for a comprehensive investment analysis. Overall, the InvestingPro data supports BofA Securities' view on CrowdStrike's growth initiatives and market potential, while also providing a nuanced perspective on the company's valuation and analysts' expectations.

Title: Former AWS Employee: “Most of the Hot Takes on Amazon’s New Strict Return-to-Office Policy Are Wrong”
URL: https://www.webpronews.com/former-aws-employee-most-of-the-hot-takes-on-amazons-new-strict-return-to-office-policy-are-wrong/
Time Published: 2024-09-18T20:45:54Z

Amazon’s recent shift toward a strict return-to-office (RTO) policy has sparked heated debates across the tech industry. For some, the mandate represents a regression, particularly in a sector that largely embraced remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, according to a former AWS employee, John McBride, the driving force behind Amazon’s controversial policy shift is not about collaboration or innovation—it’s about something much simpler: economics and taxes. “Anyone who’s been paying attention saw this coming years ago,” McBride said in a series of posts on social media, pointing to a multi-phased strategy that Amazon has rolled out over time. According to McBride, the company’s approach was carefully designed, with the ultimate goal of reducing headcount while avoiding massive tax liabilities that could significantly affect profitability. Listen to a podcast conversation on the ‘real’ reasons for Amazon’s return to the office: McBride, who left AWS in 2023 during what he referred to as “Phase 3” of Amazon’s plan, outlined the following five phases: McBride explained that while Amazon executives publicly framed these moves as necessary for “innovation” and “customer obsession,” the reality, in his view, is far less inspirational. “It’s all about reducing headcount and avoiding tax liabilities,” he asserted. The most significant factor driving this return-to-office push appears to be the economics of headcount management. During the pandemic, Amazon—along with many other tech giants—dramatically expanded its workforce. “They didn’t really have any other option,” McBride noted, citing the unprecedented demand for AWS cloud services and the need to continue scaling as more companies embraced remote work. I’m a former AWS employee: most of the hot takes on Amazon's new strict return-to-office policy are wrong. Anyone who’s been paying attention saw this coming years ago. And ultimately, it comes down to taxes and economics. Here's their plan: Phase 1: layoff over 30k people.… — John McBride (@johncodezzz) September 18, 2024 However, that growth came with significant costs. As McBride explained, AWS operates on “razor-thin margins,” despite being one of Amazon’s most profitable arms. “AWS offers incredible services at excellent usage cost pricing,” he said, pointing to the platform’s ability to enable small disruptors to enter the cloud market. This model has worked well for AWS, but in times of economic uncertainty, even small disruptions in customer spending can have outsize effects on profit margins. Now, with the broader tech sector scaling back due to rising interest rates and shrinking corporate budgets, AWS’s profitability is being squeezed. “Anyone who leaves AWS or meaningfully reduces their cloud spend can impact AWS’s razor-thin profit margins,” McBride explained. This, he argued, has created intense pressure to cut costs, and for a company like Amazon, “the most expensive cost is headcount.” Yet headcount reduction is only one part of the equation. McBride pointed out that the return-to-office mandate is also deeply rooted in tax considerations. “Amazon gets massive tax breaks from cities and states where they have offices,” he said. These breaks are contingent on Amazon bringing jobs to specific locations, like Seattle or Denver. However, those incentives can disappear if offices remain underutilized. “If Amazon continued to enable a remote workforce,” McBride explained, “the tax man would come knocking, and they’d be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars.” In other words, for Amazon, filling physical offices is not just about fostering collaboration—it’s about protecting its bottom line. This aligns with the broader economic realities facing Amazon. In 2023, the company’s overall operating margin was a mere 4.7%, and while AWS’s margins are higher—recently reported as close to 40%—those numbers still reflect the company’s general approach of operating with very thin margins at scale. McBride pointed out that Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, famously operated under the mantra “Your margin is my opportunity,” focusing on generating significant profits by operating with minimal margins across large-scale services. But as AWS faces increasing competition and clients seek ways to reduce cloud spending, maintaining profit margins becomes more difficult. “Amazon has to keep profit up by reducing headcount,” McBride summarized. The return-to-office policy is a strategic move to ensure that they maximize tax incentives while minimizing staffing costs. For many employees, however, the return-to-office policy feels more like a veiled attempt to force them out. “Phase 4: the Silent Sacking,” McBride described, is particularly brutal. Employees who resist relocation or fail to comply with the return-to-office directives often find themselves marginalized within the company. “You’d be left out of in-person meetings, stiff-armed by management, and wouldn’t be given meaningful work,” McBride said, add...

Full Content:
On Wednesday, Citi expressed continued confidence in CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD), maintaining a Buy rating and a price target of $300.00. The firm anticipates gathering firsthand accounts and evidence at the fully booked Fal.Con conference, which will shed light on various aspects of CrowdStrike's operations and market position. The insights sought to include the level of competition, particularly from a key competitor identified only as 'S', and customer and partner feedback on pricing and discounting strategies. Additionally, Citi is interested in the reception of CrowdStrike's post-outage customer commitment packages and initial reactions to the newly announced CRWD Financial Services. Citi analysts are also looking forward to the investor briefing scheduled for September 18, 2024, where they expect CrowdStrike to reaffirm its goal of reaching a $10 billion annual recurring revenue (ARR). This comes amid considerations of discounting, pricing power, and the financial implications of CRWD Financial Services. Moreover, Citi is seeking detailed updates on the uptake of customer commitment packages two months following an outage, as well as specific information on profitability and free cash flow. These factors are crucial to short-term model estimates, with investors potentially unprepared for discussions on net retention rate compression and the recalibration of costs associated with doing business. While Citi maintains its Buy rating on CrowdStrike, it anticipates that the shares may experience volatility as the market digests new information and adjusts to the evolving competitive landscape and financial metrics. In other recent news, CrowdStrike, a leader in cloud-delivered cybersecurity, has been making significant strides in both operational and financial aspects. The company recently announced a strategic partnership with Dazz to enhance cloud security measures. Additionally, CrowdStrike unveiled a fully-owned subsidiary, CrowdStrike Financial Services, aiming to simplify procurement and accelerate the consolidation of cybersecurity technologies for organizations. CrowdStrike also expanded its collaboration with 1Password to bolster cybersecurity for small and midsize businesses. The company appointed Kartik Shahani as the Vice President of India and SAARC, to boost the adoption of the CrowdStrike Falcon cybersecurity platform in the region. Financially, CrowdStrike's second fiscal quarter results surpassed expectations in terms of annual recurring revenue, revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share. However, the guidance for the third fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2025 fell short of consensus estimates, leading to various adjustments from analyst firms. Goldman Sachs reaffirmed its Buy rating on CrowdStrike's shares, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan maintained their Overweight ratings, and Deutsche Bank increased its price target due to revised revenue forecasts for FY25 and FY26. As CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) continues to capture the attention of investors and analysts alike, recent data from InvestingPro underscores some of the key financial metrics and trends that may influence investment decisions. CrowdStrike's market capitalization stands robust at approximately $65.87 billion, reflecting the market's valuation of the company. Despite trading at a high earnings multiple with a P/E ratio of 384.18, which suggests a premium on its earnings, the company's revenue growth remains strong. Over the last twelve months leading up to Q2 2025, CrowdStrike has experienced a significant revenue growth of 33.07%, underscoring its expanding market presence and business scale. Furthermore, the gross profit margin is notably high at 75.37%, indicating the company's efficiency in maintaining profitability while scaling its operations. An interesting point to consider is that CrowdStrike has been trading at a high Price / Book multiple of 23.09, which can be indicative of investor confidence in the company's future growth prospects. Additionally, the company's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, as highlighted by one of the InvestingPro Tips, providing a cushion for operational flexibility. With 39 analysts having revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, it suggests a cautious outlook on the company's immediate earnings potential. For investors seeking a deeper analysis, there are more than 15 additional InvestingPro Tips available, which can provide further insights into CrowdStrike's financial health and market position.

Title: Eating My Own Cooking: Navigating Buy, Hold And Sell Decisions - ORCL

Ringing the Register on a Portion of my ORCL At The Prudent Speculator, we believe in “eating our own cooking”—aligning our portfolio strategy with the very advice we give to readers. In a recent article, I explored three undervalued stocks recommended to readers of The Prudent Speculator that I added to my personal portfolio, demonstrating my putting my money where my mouth is conviction. Money Where My Mouth Is: 3 Undervalued Stocks For Buckingham Portfolio (forbes.com) This time, I want to expand on the strategy of not just buying undervalued stocks but knowing when to hold or even trim positions when necessary. While our philosophy encourages long-term investing, part of prudent portfolio management involves recognizing when a position has become overweight or when market conditions warrant a reassessment. We aren’t simply passive holders; we continuously evaluate the risk-reward ratio of every stock in our portfolio, ensuring it aligns with our overarching investment goals. Even as I am fond of the Mae West quip that "Too much of a good thing can be wonderful," a ballooning stock position can introduce unnecessary risk. This is why trimming positions—particularly in stocks that have outperformed and attracted more-growth-oriented investors—remains an essential part of our risk management process. Balancing conviction with discipline is key to successful long-term investing in stocks. Oracle (ORCL) is an excellent example of how I navigate the delicate balance between holding a high-performing stock and managing risk. Following Oracle’s 2024 Financial Analyst Day, the company continues to make significant strides, with leadership expressing confidence in exceeding the fiscal 2026 revenue target of $66 billion and suggesting that more than $100 billion in revenue is in the cards in fiscal 2029. With the cloud business growing at a rapid pace, contributing substantially to both top-line and bottom-line growth, it’s no surprise that shares have rallied over 50% this year. Oracle's ability to transition from a product-based model to a cloud-centric one is driving this performance, with gross profit from the cloud outpacing losses from legacy license and support revenue. As EVP Doug Kehring highlighted, Oracle’s impressive 5:1 ratio of cloud profit growth to license decline underscores the company’s lucrative shift to cloud services, positioning the company for strong long-term gains. However, despite our bullish outlook on Oracle’s long-term prospects, our risk management practices, not to mention our penchant for value-investing, dictate taking a little money off the table. After all, ORCL now trades for more than 25 times projected earnings and for more than 8 times sales. True, those numbers are not excessive, but I think they argue for a little caution. As I like to say, the hardest part about market timing is getting the timing right. So, we must be prepared for stocks to continue their upward trajectory once we have placed our sell orders, which has been the case since my ORCL trim. Still, we are reminded of similar occurrences following the trims of Broadcom (AVGO), Lam Research (LRCX) and Qualcomm (QCOM), as those stocks continued higher after our paring of our stake but are now trading well below our sale prices. Even after trimming our Oracle position, I maintain a modestly overweight allocation in both my personal account and for clients, so I would love to see the stock price move higher. My team and I continue to believe the company’s fundamentals remain strong, but caution is warranted in the current environment, where tech stocks have been subject to both quick near-term rallies as well as significant pullbacks. Through careful portfolio adjustments like these, I endeavor to stay aligned with both the long-term growth potential of our investments and the risk thresholds that protect our clients' wealth.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA - JUNE 26: In this handout photo provided by Intel, Tom Kilroy, vice president of ... [+] Intel?s Digital Enterprise Group, displays Intel's new Dual-Core Xeon Processor 5100 on June 26, 2006 at an event in San Francisco. Available for high-volume servers, workstation and communications markets, the 64-bit processor is based on the Intel Core Microarchitecture for increased performance with reduced energy consumption. (Photo by Court Mast/Intel via Getty Images) Intel stock (NASDAQ: INTC) rallied by close to 6% in Monday’s trading and gained by another 8% in after-hours trading, taking the stock to levels of about $22 per share. Intel stock still remains down by over 50% year-to-date. Now the recent surge comes following news that Intel has secured a manufacturing contract from Amazon for its foundry business, where it will design and produce custom AI chipsets for Amazon’s cloud division, AWS. Intel will produce the specialized “AI fabric chip” for Amazon, using its 18A manufacturing process, which is the company’s most advanced chip manufacturing technology. Intel also indicated that more chip designs from AWS could be coming, including versions that will leverage Intel’s upcoming 18AP and 14A processes. Separately, Bloomberg reported last Friday that Intel has received $3.5 billion in grants from the Pentagon to manufacture chips for the U.S. military, although Intel declined to comment on the Pentagon grants. The new wins present a big opportunity for Intel. If the company executes well on its foundry plans and delivers compelling new CPU and GPU chips, Intel could see almost 3x upside. On the other hand, if it fails to execute, Intel stock could see a downside to $10 Now INTC stock has declined over the last 3-year period and the fall has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 6% in 2021, -47% in 2022, and 95% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could INTC face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery? For years, Intel has faced growing frustration from investors as it lost market share to AMD in the PC and server sectors. Adding to this, the industry has been shifting from CPUs to GPUs, particularly in the generative AI era, where GPUs are better suited for the intensive computational tasks that AI demands. The recent wins with Amazon and the Pentagon could mark a turning point for Intel, as generative artificial intelligence dominates the narrative in the computing and semiconductor markets. The Amazon deal, in particular, is seen as a strong vote of confidence in Intel’s improving chip-making capabilities given AWS’s position as the largest public cloud services provider. Intel’s foundry business which has been at the heart of the company’s struggles, has lagged behind competitors like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Samsung. Intel’s attempts to reclaim leadership in chip fabrication have been very capital-intensive and have been hampered by the company’s manufacturing and design missteps. In fact, Intel has had to outsource production of some of its latest CPUs to TSMC. In 2023, Intel’s foundry business reported a $7 billion operating loss on $18.9 billion in revenue, highlighting the scale of the challenges it has faced. Much of the future of Intel’s manufacturing roadmap hinges on the success of the new 18A process. While production on this process is expected to begin in 2025, Intel announced in early August that it had reached critical milestones, noting that the chips made with this process had powered on, booted Windows, and were operational within Intel. Once Intel transitions its latest server and PC chips to this process node, ending its outsourcing of chips to TSMC, we could see higher utilization rates, which would help reduce costs. Additionally, Intel indicated that the first external foundry customer was expected to tape out (move from design to foundry for manufacturing) on the 18A node in the first half of 2025. This could also boost Intel revenues to a certain extent. A key challenge for Intel will lie in meeting production yield expectations at a large scale. However, there have been encouraging signs here as well. Intel recently indicated that the production process was seeing a defect density of 0.4. Defect density refers to the number of defects present per unit area on a wafer and a metric of under 0.5 defects per square centimeter is considered favorable. Intel s... (truncated)

Title: Big Tech companies are getting flatter. Mark Zuckerberg explained why over a year ago.

Time Published: 2024-09-18T10:02:02Z

Amazon is putting middle managers under the microscope as it seeks to thin out the layers of the sprawling company. The move furthers the Big Tech trend of flattening org charts that Mark Zuckerberg and others like Elon Musk have talked about in recent years while preaching the need for efficiency. CEO Andy Jassy announced the changes on Monday alongside an RTO mandate that will require Amazon employees to return to the office 5 days a week starting in January. The Amazon CEO wrote that he's also asking senior leadership teams "to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025." "Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today," Jassy wrote in a memo to staff. "If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates' ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations' ability to make customers' lives better and easier every day," Jassy added. You can bet that somewhere in Silicon Valley, Mark Zuckerberg nodded his head when he heard the news — after all, he's been speaking out in favor of flattening org charts both publicly and in private for a while now. "I don't think you want a management structure that's just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work," the Meta CEO reportedly said in an internal meeting in January 2023. In an earnings call a month later, Zuckerberg said the company was "working on flattening our org structure and removing some layers of middle management to make decisions faster." Zuckerberg also proclaimed a "year of efficiency" at Meta last year, following two rounds of layoffs that cumulatively cost roughly 21,000 people their jobs. The Meta CEO said in a podcast interview that same year that he believed "a lot" in the need for managers, pointing to how managers help younger people "grow and learn in their career." But he said there was "a mathematical way" to think about the ratio of employees to managers. Before Meta's layoffs, Zuckerberg said he inquired about the average number of direct reports each manager had at Meta and learned it was around three to four. He felt it should be more like seven to eight. But, at the time, the lower numbers made sense as Meta was hiring a ton and helping newcomers ramp up. "So in a world where we're not adding so many people as quickly, is it as valuable to have a lot of managers who have extra capacity waiting for new people? No, right?" Zuckerberg said. "So, now we could sort of defragment the organization and get to a place where the average is closer to that seven or eight," he added. "It just ends up being a somewhat more kind of compact management structure, which, you know, decreases the latency on information going up and down the chain and I think empowers people more." Meta's emphasis on leanness paid off and was rewarded by Wall Street and investors: Meta hit a $1 trillion market cap earlier this year. The broader industry has followed suit in trimming management. Middle-managers made up 31.5% of layoffs in 2023, up from 19.7% in 2018, according to analysis. Shopify announced last year that it would flatten its organization by grouping employees into either individual contributors or managers and incentivizing more of them to become the former. Under pressure from activist investors to become more efficient, Salesforce last year aimed to reduce "layers of control" by giving managers a specific number of direct reports in order to trim management layers, people familiar with the matter previously told Business Insider. At Airbnb, CEO Brian Chesky has said the company "got rid of the classic product management function" and instead changed it into an "Apple-style product marketing function." As for Amazon, the company hasn't yet said publicly if layoffs are part of its strategy to increase the number of individual contributors to managers. But if Amazon is following Meta and other Big Tech companies' lead — don't be surprised if a middle-management culling is on the horizon. Just look at what Amazon's internal document said about potential job cuts, as first reported by Business Insider's Ashley Stewart. "It's possible that organizations may identify roles that are no longer required." Jump to

Title: It's a tough time to be a manager in tech

Managers may just have the toughest job in tech right now. In the latest blow to middle managers, Amazon announced it planned to reduce the number of supervisors within its organization. CEO Andy Jassy said in a message to employees posted to Amazon News that the company plans to flatten departments and ask senior leadership teams to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Jassy said the move was part of an effort to get the company operating "like the world's largest startup," allowing employees to "move fast" and not waste time with "unnecessary processes." A copy of an internal document obtained by Business Insider indicates the new plan could result in role eliminations as "organizations may identify roles that are no longer required." It's the latest hit to tech's wearied middle managers amid a rough few years. Many have found themselves in the firing line of sweeping layoffs as Big Tech companies scramble to cut costs. Those who kept their jobs have complained of being left with more work amid hiring slowdowns. Lynda Gratton, a professor of management practice at London Business School, told BI that middle managers had steadily been asked to do more post-pandemic. "Manager overwork and burnout is a real issue," she said. "The pandemic meant that many are also managing complex hybrid teams." Amazon is not the first tech company to balk at its own corporate structure. At Meta, Mark Zuckerberg has been gradually eliminating layers of middle management. The tech boss said he doesn't like seeing "managers managing managers" and has been "flattening" his company ever since. The reorg has seen many Meta supervisors demoted with the aim of having more people on the ground doing things like coding, designing, or selling. Shopify has also been flattening its structure to have fewer managers. At X, Elon Musk has ordered engineering managers to get back into the coding trenches with their direct reports. The reduction of middle managers is, in part, a reaction to overhiring during the COVID-19 pandemic and a backlash against so-called "fake work" within the tech sector. But significantly reducing the number of managers could also backfire on companies. "Tech firms have worked out that the most productive technologists are well managed, feel secure, are mentored and supported, and feel listened to," Gratton said. "That's one of the reasons why they have invested more in managers — when management is done well — they are the golden thread." When asked to comment, representatives for Amazon referred BI back to Jassy's online statement. Jump to

Title: AI could take thousands of call centre jobs at ASB’s Australian parent. How about here?

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. CBA - which owns ASB - is experimenting with advanced AI chatbots running on a new Amazon and Nvidia-powered system. Image / 123RF Commonwealth Bank of Australia - owner of ASB - is exploring the possibility of replacing thousands of its call centre staff with AI, according to an AFR report. The bank, which has some 2400 local call centre staff, announced on Tuesday it’s conducting trials with a generative AI chatbot called “Hey CommBank”, testing the technology on employees of the bank who are also customers. Could it happen on this side of the ditch? “We believe it’s our people that set us apart at ASB and they’ll always be integral to our customer offering,” an ASB spokeswoman told the Herald. “We continue to explore how advancements in tech, including AI, can support our people to do their jobs efficiently but have no plans to replace a large number of roles any time soon. “We’re already using a range of technology, including AI, alongside our team, to enhance the experience we offer our customers. For example, our chatbot Josie has been supporting customers using our digital channels since 2018.” “There’s emerging evidence that AI-driven voice and chatbot interfaces, powered by frontier LLMs [large language models] such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude are approaching human-level capability interacting with human callers and resolving customer service inquiries first time,” said Ben Reid, the founding executive director of AI Forum NZ, who’s now running his own future technology consultancy, Memia. “Clearly if this removes the need to wait on hold listening to muzak for hours then most people will welcome this as a positive development,” he says. “But in reality, as with all AI solutions, the reliability and accuracy of these AI voice solutions is still not quite good enough for prime-time.” “It is inevitable that AI will replace aspects of customer service,” Victoria University senior lecturer in artificial intelligence Andrew Lensen said. “And for some customers, that’s a positive thing. Many ‘digital natives’ would much prefer a high-quality chatbot than talking to a person. But we need to manage the transition fairly and justly.” CommBank’s announcement of its AI trial earlier this week drew fire from Australia’s Finance Sector Union, which said it was not consulted before the launch. Finance Sector Union assistant secretary Nicole McPherson told the AFR the rollout of the new technology was “disrespectful and tricky”. “I’ve been concerned about AI replacing jobs for a few years now – and it looks like it’s finally being publicly acknowledged. Salaries are some of the biggest costs to businesses, so I am not surprised to see a bank moving forward with replacing customer service with AI,” Lensen said. “We can be sure that if the Aussie banks are exploring this, then it will affect Kiwis as well. After all, our banks are nearly all Australian-owned. “What is the plan for workers who are being made redundant by AI? Will the banks help them to re/upskill? Are the Australian and New Zealand Governments prepared for what could be significant layoffs in the workforce (on top of the existing government cuts)? I don’t see anyone answering these questions – we need to take this very seriously as a society and the coalition Government needs to show leadership in addressing these real issues, rather than just promoting AI as being good for productivity and economic growth.” Technology Minister Judith Collins sent a strategy paper to Cabinet centred on light policing of AI, saying new rules would stifle innovation at a time when New Zealand needed to catch up with other countries. Lensen said that by “all but ruling out AI regulation”, Collins was taking a different path to most of our trading partners. He wanted to see the Government at the very least map the lay of the land, surveying which industries and jobs would be affected by AI - and when and how. “Beyond job losses, we should also be concerned about the automation of financial advice and services. Even the very best-designed chatbots can fail – for example, we saw Air Canada in the news a few months ago when their AI chatbot hallucinated a new bereavement policy,” Lensen said. “Air Canada had to pay out in court – so there’s a risk for businesses, too. What happens when a bank AI chatbot gives somebody the wrong advice on their mortgage? Will the bank put aside some of its profits to self-insurance against these mistakes?” AI is already being used to augment helpdesk operations. One NZ’s Jason Paris recently noted that’s been the case for years, well before ChatGPT’s public release threw artificial intelligence into the mainstream. Paris has also been among those who have argued that many customers prefer a smooth, quick digital experience to talking to a human for the likes of simple queries and account changes. CBA is ramping up its artificial intelligence efforts. On T... (truncated)
