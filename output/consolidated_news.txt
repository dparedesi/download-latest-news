Title: Rich like Bill Gates: Meet the Saudi sisters wielding $75 billion in a man’s world

When President Donald Trump feted Saudi Arabia’s crown prince at a state dinner last month, invitees included heavyweights like Apple boss Tim Cook and Citigroup’s Jane Fraser. Seated next to Elon Musk was Lubna Olayan, whose deep connections to both Wall Street and the kingdom marked her out as one of the most influential people in a room packed with luminaries. That White House banquet underscored the growing influence of the Olayan Group, a sprawling and secretive Saudi empire that Lubna and her sister Hutham have helmed for decades. The duo came of age at a time when women weren’t permitted to drive and needed a male guardian’s permission to even get a passport in the kingdom. Yet they’ve managed to steer the family conglomerate into a behemoth that operates at the scale of a sovereign wealth fund. Described as frank and outgoing, Saudi businesswoman Lubna Olayan has a reputation for being deeply involved with her family’s investments.Credit: Bloomberg The group controls a nearly $US13 billion ($19.6 billion) stock portfolio in the US, with stakes worth almost $US1 billion in BlackRock and $US1.5 billion in JPMorgan Chase, filings show. A large investor in Credit Suisse before its collapse, the conglomerate boasts a prime property portfolio that spans from Madison Avenue to central London. It has forged a large Dubai real-estate deal with Brookfield, and makes vast investments in private equity and fixed income. At home, it bottles Coca-Cola, runs Burger King outlets and services oilfields. Those bets have transformed the Olayan clan into one of the world’s richest families. Their fortune is valued at more than $US50 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which is including them in its annual list for the first time. That figure doesn’t fully reflect the magnitude of their riches, according to people familiar with the matter, as the group discloses limited financial information. Many of them pegged the Olayans’ net worth well above $US100 billion, putting them in the same league as Bill Gates, Carlos Slim and Mukesh Ambani. ‘Normally we don’t seek the limelight…especially anything splashy. We avoid excess, and we are pretty frugal.’ That makes the Olayans richer than Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the royal known as Saudi Arabia’s Warren Buffett. Their influence extends well beyond that financial firepower, aided in part by a loyalty to Saudi Arabia during tough times that’s made the group an indispensable national fixture, people familiar with the matter said. The extent of the Olayans’ reach often has Wall Street bosses reaching out for advice as they race to expand in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s nearly $US1.3 trillion economy. “MBS continues to be drawn to the US as preferred partner in security and economic development,” said Steffen Hertog, a professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science. “Having private interlocutors with close links to US finance is useful.” A US-based representative for the Olayan Group didn’t comment and directed all requests to a Saudi-based spokesperson, who didn’t respond to a detailed list of questions. Most global executives are reluctant to speak about the family for fear of offending the sisters, who are known to fiercely guard their privacy. This story is based on an analysis of the family’s investments, operating companies and filings of family-owned entities, as well as interviews with more than half a dozen people familiar with the group, who asked not to be named discussing information that isn’t public. Hutham and Lubna, both in their early seventies, were born in Saudi Arabia to Suliman Olayan. The patriarch was orphaned at a young age and started out working as a dispatcher for the predecessor company of Saudi Aramco, leveraging his fluent English. He mortgaged his house for $US8000 to win a pipeline contract, according to a profile in Time magazine, eventually launching the Olayan Group in 1947. From there, Suliman diversified aggressively, and the group went on to strike partnerships to sell Colgate toothpaste, Oreos and Coca-Cola in the kingdom. He bought US equities to use as credit with American banks and by 1980, his conglomerate brought in more than $US300 million in annual revenue, according to the Time profile. His globalist bent created a uniquely bi-national empire that the daughters were immersed in early. Both studied in the US and were given significant jobs in the family business on their return. After Suliman’s death in 2002, his son Khaled was named chairman of Olayan Group, but Lubna and Hutham helped run much of the family’s vast operations. Lubna led the Mideast-focused division and Hutham took charge of Olayan America. The sisters married foreigners and took on prominent roles — Lubna was the first woman elected to the board of a public company in Saudi Arabia in 2004. Even then, women’s rights were severely limited in the kingdom. Only in 2018 were women finally given the right to drive. In an interview with NPR in 2018, Lubna recalled the difficulty finding a ladies room in factories and boardrooms because there were usually no women. She began approaching government officials and executives for help boosting the female workforce — all the while being reminded to tread carefully and attempting to avoid confrontation. “So, you negotiate, you deal, you do this, you take and give,” she said in the interview about those early efforts. Along the way, the sisters developed reputations for being steely negotiators. Their ascent was aided by an ability to keep a low profile and the duo ensured their business was seen as supportive of the government’s aims. The group is now officially headquartered in Liechtenstein, with offices around the world, including in Athens, where Lubna’s lawyer husband has deep ties. Over the years, the family has gained a reputation for running a stringently professional organisation that’s sophisticated in its dealmaking at a level not typically seen at family offices. The Olayans are deemed richer than Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the royal known as Saudi Arabia’s Warren Buffett.Credit: AP “The family was very conscious of incorporating corporate governance frameworks into their business, and they did it with a high level of professionalism,” said Josiane Fahed-Sreih, director of the Institute of Family and Entrepreneurial Business at Lebanese American University. In one sign of their influence, the Olayan family was untouched in 2017 when dozens of Saudi royals, former officials and businessmen, including Alwaleed, were detained at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh as the crown prince consolidated power and conducted an unprecedented national shakeup. Alwaleed, worth about $US17 billion these days, has made a comeback of sorts in recent years and his investment group has benefited from the kingdom’s construction frenzy. In the 1990s, the businessman was known for a flamboyant lifestyle, frequently pictured on a private yacht purchased from Donald Trump. The Olayans do things differently. “Normally we don’t seek the limelight…especially anything splashy,” Hutham said about the Olayan family in a speech to the Arab Bankers Association of North America in 2013. “We avoid excess, and we are pretty frugal.” Even so, there have been investing missteps. A longtime investor in Credit Suisse, they stuck by the bank even through its downturn, ultimately becoming one of the big losers in the turmoil that culminated with UBS Group’s discount purchase of the troubled lender. The losses were at a scale that could roil large financial firms, but one international executive recalls the collapse being treated as a relative non-event within the Olayan Group. The conglomerate continued to execute transactions and payments as normal during the period, the person said. Saudi National Bank, the Swiss lender’s top shareholder, was among firms that lost money on its investment and its chairman resigned in the aftermath. Meanwhile, the Olayans’ profile has only grown in the years since. Key to that are their relationships on Wall Street and within the kingdom, particularly as Riyadh has started to intensify pressure on foreign firms to invest more locally and help diversify the economy. Despite recent fiscal pressures, Saudi Arabia remains a lucrative market for the titans of global finance: Riyadh ranks as one of the biggest issuers of debt in recent years, while the kingdom’s wealth fund has shown an appetite for blockbuster deals like the recent $US55 billion transaction to take Electronic Arts Inc private. Lubna has close connections to BlackRock co-founder Larry Fink, among others, and was recently named co-chair of the US-Saudi Business Council alongside Citi’s Fraser. Hutham sits on the board of Brookfield, which ranks as one of the biggest private equity investors in the Middle East. This year, during Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative conference, often called Davos in the Desert, Lubna hosted a party in Riyadh that had top global financial executives and officials mingling over canapés and rice and lamb, according to one attendee. Their links run broader than just finance. The US equity investments their father started to amass in the 1960s have grown to $US12.7 billion. These days, the portfolio includes stakes in Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. By comparison, Saudi Arabia’s $US1 trillion wealth fund owns just over $US19 billion in US stocks. The group’s private equity portfolio forms another large chunk, and is estimated to run into the tens of billions of dollars, according to people familiar with the matter. Compounded annual growth rate for direct investments has exceeded 30 per cent over a 10-year period, according to its website. The firm’s real-estate holdings span more than 40 million square feet and 40,000 apartments under management. At home, the Olayans have backed the kingdom’s biggest efforts. When Saudi Aramco’s $US25 billion IPO struggled to attract international investors in 2019, the Olayan family was among those tapped locally by the administration of MBS — as the de facto ruler is called — to shore up demand. Lubna Olayan has successfully navigated the obstacles for women in the Saudi business world. “You negotiate, you deal, you do this, you take and give,” she says.Credit: Bloomberg At the same time, the sisters have managed a careful balancing act with their public comments. In 2018, as much of Wall Street avoided the kingdom’s FII conference after Saudi agents murdered columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Lubna used the start of a panel discussion to mourn his death, saying that the act ran counter to Saudi values. “We are very grateful that the terrible acts reported in recent weeks are alien to our culture and our DNA,” Lubna said in her address. These days, Lubna is chair of the Olayan Group’s corporate board, according to a recent press release from the US-Saudi Business Council. Hutham chairs the shareholders’ board, the group’s website says. Day-to-day operations are mostly managed by the likes of Chief Executive Officer Hani Lazkani and Chief Operating Officer Samer Yaghnam, people familiar with the matter said, though the sisters remain the public face of the group and helm broad strategy with family members. Multiple people described Lubna as frank and outgoing, with a reputation for being deeply involved with her investments. Like her father, she’s worldly and warm but also incisive, said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute and a friend of the late Suliman. “If you talk with her about current events, it’s not just, ‘This happened.’ She understands why things are moving the way they are.” Hutham, meanwhile, appears soft-spoken and grandmotherly in conversation, but her line of gentle questioning can elicit small details that can serve as fodder for the negotiating table, according to one international executive. The sisters are among the few people who understand the true extent of their sprawling business in its entirety, and tightly control its financial details. There have been moments in past years when a listing of an operating business seemed imminent, but deals haven’t materialised. Meanwhile, much has changed for Saudi women in the workforce. In the past seven years, the kingdom has announced reforms allowing women to set up businesses without male consent and travel independently, and many now run private equity funds, trade stocks and work in factories. “We look for opportunities, even in adversity,” said Hutham in her 2013 speech about her family. “We see silver linings.” Bloomberg The Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day’s trading.

Why Solana, Zcash, and the Trump Administration defined 2025, and what their dominance means for 2026. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. If 2024 was the year of the crypto reawakening, 2025 was the year the plumbing finally got permitted. This year, the emerging industry entered January with tentative optimism and exited December with federal statutes. As a result, the narrative shifted definitively from “crypto as a casino” to “crypto as capital markets infrastructure.” During this period, volumes moved on-chain, policy moved into the White House, and major asset managers moved past their hesitation, as evidenced most starkly by Vanguard’s reversal earlier this month, which allowed crypto ETFs on its platform. However, in a year defined by record-breaking flows and legislative victories, not everyone shared the spoils equally. The winners of 2025 weren’t just the assets that went up; they were the protocols, people, and products that fundamentally secured their place in the future of finance. Based on CryptoSlate's analysis, here are the 12 definitive winners of the year and why they mattered: There is no discussion of the crypto landscape in 2025 without acknowledging the sheer force of the US pivot. For years, the industry operated with one foot out the door, eyeing Dubai or Singapore. In 2025, the US slammed that door shut and locked everyone inside—happily. Considering this, the victory is shared between the jurisdiction itself and the catalyst at the top. The 47th President’s administration delivered on the industry's longest-held wish list in under 12 months, effectively re-onshoring the digital asset economy. Several Executive Orders backing digital assets set the tone, but the strategic victories were tactical. The signing of the GENIUS Act on July 18 provided the first federal definition for stablecoins, while the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” Executive Order in March signaled to sovereign wealth funds globally that digital assets were a matter of national security. Crucially, by pushing a leadership change at the SEC and the CFTC, the administration cleared the “regulation by enforcement” fog. Essentially, Trump's actions have set the tone to make the US “the crypto capital of the world.” The premier vehicle for institutional access didn't just survive its sophomore year; it thrived despite BTC's poor performance. This was evidenced by BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) emerging as one of the top 10 US ETFs by inflows, outpacing traditional heavyweights such as the Invesco QQQ Trust and the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). Away from the flagship digital asset, Ethereum spot ETFs cemented their status as the default on-ramp for wealth managers, rendering the “not your keys, not your coins” debate irrelevant for the suit-and-tie crowd. The pivotal moment came in September when the SEC approved **generic listing standards**. This technical but crucial policy win slashed the red tape for future products, removing the need for 19b-4 filings for every single new ticker. As a result, the market welcomed an avalanche of new products focused on other digital assets, such as Solana and XRP, which also delivered strong performance this year. Solana effectively shed its “beta” reputation in 2025, as the “fast but breaks” narrative is dead. At the same time, Solana pulled off the most difficult pivot in crypto this year by going from the “memecoin casino” to the “liquidity layer” of the global market. While it maintained its cultural dominance, CoinGecko reported that Solana was the most-followed blockchain ecosystem globally in 2025 for the second consecutive year. The network is no longer just about speculative tokens; it is now where efficient capital lives. According to Artemis data, Solana has emerged as a fundamental liquidity layer, with on-chain SOL-USD trading volume exceeding the combined SOL spot volume on Binance and Bybit, two of the top three centralized exchanges by trading volume, for three consecutive months. Essentially, Solana has differentiated itself as the primary venue for execution-sensitive activity. It is no longer just competing with Ethereum; it is competing with Nasdaq. If Solana won on speed, Coinbase’s Layer-2 network, Base, won on distribution. By leveraging the US-based exchange's massive existing user base, Base became the sticky default for consumer apps and stablecoin experimentation. Base proved that in 2025, distribution matters more than novel cryptography. It became the launchpad for “normie” crypto—consumer fintech apps that use crypto rails on the backend without the user ever knowing. It is the bridge between the chaotic on-chain world and the regulated safety of Coinbase. After years of legal purgatory, 2025 was the year Ripple and XRP were finally set free. The long-running battle between the firm and the SEC officially concluded with a final judgment that cleared the runway for institutional adoption. As a result, XRP's narrative shifted overnight from “litigation risk” to “liquidity engine,” driving its value upward and paving the way for the launch of the first Spot XRP ETFs in November. At the same time, the company behind it, Ripple, spent the year aggressively buying the plumbing of traditional finance. Ripple deployed over $4 billion in strategic acquisitions this year alone, most notably the purchase of prime broker Hidden Road, treasury management firm GTreasury, and stablecoin infrastructure provider Rail. These moves have effectively transformed Ripple from a “payments company” into a full-stack institutional powerhouse. The surprise comeback of the year was Zcash and the privacy sector as a whole. Emerging as the undisputed best-performing sector of 2025, privacy coins shed their “illicit” stigma to become the darlings of the post-surveillance economy. While Zcash led the charge, the momentum was sector-wide. Ethereum developers accelerated their privacy initiatives, while other privacy solutions finally gained mainnet traction. Moreover, the regulatory thaw was palpable as the SEC held formal meetings with privacy protocol leaders to discuss compliant architecture. Notably, that would have been unthinkable a year ago. Real World Assets (RWAs) moved from “pilot programs” to “critical plumbing,” heavily aided by a friendly SEC. The Commission’s shift away from hostile enforcement allowed major players to integrate these assets without fear of a Wells Notice. The watershed moment was BlackRock’s BUIDL fund being accepted as off-exchange collateral on Binance. This blurred the lines between TradFi and the crypto market structure. By December, tokenized money market funds and T-bills had surpassed $8 billion in AUM, while the broader RWA market is around $20 billion. Moreover, traditional financial giants like BlackRock, JPMorgan, Fidelity, Nasdaq, and Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) are heavily banking on the sector to make the traditional financial sector more transparent and efficient. Like Paul Atkins, the SEC Chair, said: “On-chain markets will bring greater predictability, transparency, and efficiency for investors.” The “killer app” debate is over. Stablecoins are the rail. The sector's market cap breached $300 billion in October, while Ethereum-based stablecoin supply hit an all-time high of $166 billion in September. In fact, Token Terminal stated that the total number of stablecoin holders is at an all-time high of around 200 million. This shows that the sector's growth was driven by these assets' ability to settle instantly, 24/7, across borders. Meanwhile, legislative progress in the US, especially the passage of the GENIUS Act, provided the legal clarity for banks to enter the fray. Essentially, stablecoins are no longer just trading chips; they are becoming the settlement layer for global fintech. Jeremy NG, the founder of Open Eden, captured it best, saying: “Stablecoins have crossed the line from crypto plumbing to financial infrastructure.” On-chain derivatives crossed the credibility chasm as monthly volumes hit a record $1.2 trillion in October. This sector won because it successfully siphoned volume from centralized exchanges (CEXs) by offering self-custody and, frankly, better incentives. The rise of perp DEXs like Hyperliquid and Aster signals a maturity in DeFi market structure. Traders are increasingly comfortable leaving billions in smart contract risk to avoid counterparty risk. 2025 was the year event contracts entered the US mainstream as Kalshi and Polymarket, the two dominant platforms in the sector, printed record numbers this year. However, the headline winner is that several traditional financial institutions and crypto-native firms like Gemini and Coinbase have also thrown their hats into the nascent sector. This sector won because it bridged the gap between “gambling” and “finance.” With Polymarket also receiving a path forward via an amended CFTC framework, event contracts are moving from niche internet curiosities to regulated hedging instruments. While the US focused on legislation, Hong Kong focused on execution supremacy—and the data proves it. In Q3 2025, Hong Kong's ETP market officially overtook South Korea and Japan to become the third largest globally by turnover, with average daily turnover hitting HK$37.8 billion (+150% YoY). The city's strategy of regulatory clarity paid off in tangible exchange milestones. The VATP (Virtual Asset Trading Platform) regime matured from a “deemed-to-be-licensed” purgatory into a robust ecosystem. By mid-2025, the SFC granted full licenses to additional major global exchanges, bringing the total number of licensed exchanges to 11. This effectively funneled regional institutional liquidity into a compliant, bank-connected net, isolating unregulated players. At the same time, the city's Stablecoins Ordinance that came into force on Aug. 1, created a pristine sandbox that attracted over 30 applicants by the September deadline. The final spot on this list belongs to you—the cohort that stayed. Over the past grueling years, early believers were told that crypto was a fraud, a bubble, or a dead end. They endured the collapse of 2022, the regulatory chokehold of the Gensler years, and the boredom of 2024. In 2025, they were vindicated. This year wasn't just about “numbers go up”; it was about “thesis proved right.” As a result, the early believers successfully front-ran the most prominent institutions on earth. When BlackRock, Vanguard, and Sovereign Wealth Funds finally entered the arena in force this year, they were buying bags from individuals who had high-conviction foresight when the outlook was bleakest. The 2026 Outlook: As this cohort realizes generational wealth, they are not exiting the ecosystem—they are becoming its bankers.

Title: Ethereum price under pressure as $6B options expiry nears

ETH options data shows investors increasing downside protection as the year-end $6 billion options expry approaches, signaling caution. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ether (ETH) has been unable to sustain prices above $3,400 for the past 40 days, raising concerns among traders that bears may remain in control longer. Key takeaways: $6B in Ether options will expire on Friday, with call (buy) bets outnumbering put (sell) instruments by 2.2 times. Bears hold the advantage unless ETH price breaks $3,100. The $6 billion ETH options expiry on Friday may add further pressure, as bulls had anticipated year-end prices of $4,000 or higher before the 28% crash in November. Ether’s price at 8:00 am UTC on Friday will determine whether bears retain control, despite call options outnumbering put instruments by a factor of 2.2. Deribit accounts for 70% of total open interest, followed by the Chicago-based CME with 20%. However, most of the $4.1 billion in call options are set to expire worthless on Friday, as traders concentrated bullish bets on year-end Ether prices between $3,500 and $5,000. Less than 15% of aggregate call options were positioned at $3,000 or lower. Related: Trend Research quietly becomes one of Ethereum’s largest whales with 46K ETH buy Even excluding overly optimistic calls at $5,000 and above, which likely carried limited cost to buyers, data shows that fewer than 25% of these instruments were placed below $3,200. Traders often sell covered calls at $8,000 and $10,000 year-end strikes with no realistic expectation of reaching those levels. While bulls were overly confident that Ether would reclaim $3,400 by year-end, bearish strategies may also have gone too far by clustering bets between $2,200 and $2,900. If Ether trades above $2,950 on Friday, more than 60% of the $1.9 billion in aggregate put options will expire worthless. Even so, bearish positions remain better placed as long as ETH stays below $3,200.

According to Bloomberg, Nvidia (NVDA US) halted production tests that relied on Intel’s manufacturing processes. As traders priced in weaker prospects for the economic impact of artificial intelligence in the US, many moved to hedge their ETH positions. Demand for bearish ETH options strategies increased, including the “bear diagonal put spread,” “bear put spread” and “bear call spread,” particularly after multiple failed attempts to reclaim the $3,400 level over the past five weeks. Below are four probable scenarios for the year-end ETH aggregate options expiry based on current price trends: $2,700 to $2,900: The net result favors the put instruments by $580 million. $2,901 to $3,000: The net result favors the put instruments by $440 million. $3,101 to $3,200: Balanced outcome between call and put options. $3,201 to $3,300: The net result favors the call instruments by $150 million. A Friday expiry below $2,900 could further weaken Ether investor sentiment. However, Ether bulls still have an opportunity to push prices toward $3,100 on Friday, which would help balance positioning and distance Ether’s price from the $2,775 December lows.

Fifteen months after seeing its first five commercial mobile-broadband satellites reach orbit, AST SpaceMobile now has a sixth circling the Earth. The first of the company’s second-generation BlueBird Block 2 satellites lifted off at 10:25 p.m. EST Tuesday from India’s Satish Dhawan Space Centre atop an LVM3 (Launch Vehicle Mark III) rocket. About 15 minutes later, mission controllers confirmed the satellite’s deployment into a 323-mile-high orbit from the upper stage of that expendable launch vehicle. “This launch validates years of US innovation and American manufacturing, executed by our team, and marks the transition to scaled deployment,” AST’s press release quotes Abel Avellan, its founder, chairman, and CEO. “With BlueBird 6 now in orbit, we are firmly on the path to delivering true space-based cellular broadband directly to everyday smartphones, at a global scale.” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated the launch in a post on X, saying it featured “the heaviest satellite ever launched from Indian soil” and advanced India’s self-reliance agenda. The country is working toward inaugurating its own human spaceflight program with an upgraded version of the LVM3 rocket. BlueBird 6 is a much larger spacecraft than AST’s first five production satellites, launched in September 2024 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla. The Midland, Tex., company’s press release touts the new spacecraft as “the largest commercial communications array ever deployed in low Earth orbit,” at almost 2,400 square feet. AST says this design’s massive antenna and processing capability will allow it to support more than 2,000 cells per satellite, with 120Mbps of bandwidth per cell for messaging, voice, and data service to unmodified phones on the ground. Achieving that full capacity, however, will require an upgraded ASIC that a November earnings release reported is not set for “first integration” with a satellite until Q1 2026. AST’s Tuesday announcement predicted that the company will launch 45 to 60 satellites by the end of the year, which company executives have said would be more than enough to provide commercial coverage across the US for its partners AT&T and Verizon. The company aims for its next launch in January from Cape Canaveral and plans to step up its delivery cadence by using higher-capacity launch vehicles. In its November earnings call, executives said the Falcon 9 can loft three next-gen BlueBirds at a time, while Blue Origin’s New Glenn can carry eight at a time. AST, however, is now years and hundreds of satellites behind SpaceX’s Starlink, which has been providing messaging and, more recently, app-specific data roaming service to T-Mobile and other partner carriers with 650-plus direct-to-cell Starlinks. Many industry analysts, having seen AST repeatedly fall behind its own forecasts, now predict that AST won’t be able to provide substantial competition to Starlink in direct-to-device service until 2027. This company does, however, hold one non-trivial advantage in what looks like an extremely one-sided contest so far: It’s the one firm somewhat reasonably positioned to provide a commercial direct-to-cell alternative to SpaceX and its mercurial CEO, Elon Musk.

Title: U.S. unemployment claims dropped again last week, remaining at a historically healthy level

Support our journalism by making your most generous year-end gift now. All gifts doubled until midnight, December 31. Matt Ott, Associated Press Matt Ott, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week and remain at historically healthy levels despite some signs that the labor market is weakening. U.S. applications for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 20 fell by 10,000 to 214,000 from the previous week's 224,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. That's below the 232,000 new applications forecast of analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet. The weekly report was released a day early due to the Christmas holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market.

Last week, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk's purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls. Hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March. WATCH: Jobs report reveals cooling labor market and 'uneven economy,' analyst says Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon, but those workforce reductions can take months to show up in the government's data. The Labor Department's report Wednesday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 750 to 216,750. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 13 rose by 38,000 to 1.92 million, the government said. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

Title: How XRP Is Approaching A Structural Break That Could Change Everything
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-nearing-a-structural-break/
Time Published: 2025-12-24T16:00:11Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. After years of compression, XRP is quietly approaching a moment where the market will see a true structural break. This breakout is about a high-timeframe setup where market structure is on the verge of shifting. It is also the potential resolution of a multi-year structure that has compressed prices, absorbed supply, and conditioned participants to underestimate what comes next. At the least expected time, XRP will print a legendary candle that will set a structural foundation and never move down. A crypto investor known as 24HRSCRYPTO noted on X that this move that is coming won’t be powered by retail hype, but by real economic activity on the XRP Ledger. When the altcoin begins to function as a settlement asset, volatility will become a liability, rather than a feature. Additionally, the payment rails, liquidity provisioning, and institutional settlement system will require price stability. A bridge asset referred to as a vehicle currency cannot swing 30-40% and still clear trillions in value. As volume and utility increase, XRP begins to transition from a speculative instrument into market infrastructure. Liquidity depth would be key to absorb shocks, while the price becomes anchored by demand. This is why the first candle isn’t a top, but the market repricing XRP’s role from a tradeable asset into a financial primitive. With new initiatives, XRP’s adoption is set to increase. Analyst X Finance Bull has revealed that RLUSD is the first US trust-regulated stablecoin launched by Ripple, issued natively on the XRP Ledger and extending across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains for broader institutional access. Any banks that would integrate with RLUSD will be automatically onboarded into the XRP rails. This isn’t just about stable payments, but about demand generation for the altcoin as the default bridge asset. From BlackRock funds flow to global repo markets, that’s where the real volume begins to flow. This flips the game, allowing RLUSD to provide the liquidity, while XRP captures the movement. For the first time, XRP Ledger has now processed over 4 billion transactions since its launch in 2012. Co-founder of Tedlabsio, a crypto trader and investor, Niels, has pointed out that the real-world usage across the network has sustained more than 13 years of uninterrupted operation. The XRPL consistently handles around 1.5 million transactions per day, with regular peaks exceeding 5 million, and settles in 3 to 5 seconds. All of this happens at fractions of a cent per transaction. Over time, more than 13 million XRP have been burned in transaction fees, a metric that reflects continuous demand in network activity. This is why institutions pay attention to XRPL. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: BlackRock strategists expect limited rate cuts in 2026 unless labor market cracks

Time Published: 2025-12-24T15:11:11Z
Full Content:
Share this article The Federal Reserve is expected to deliver limited rate cuts in 2026 unless there is a sharp deterioration in the labor market, according to BlackRock senior strategists Amanda Lynam and Dominique Bly. Their outlook reflects recent US labor market data, which point to modest softening but no sharp downturn. Although the unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November, the highest since 2021, analysts noted that part of the increase was driven by higher labor force participation and government job losses rather than a fundamental weakening in labor conditions. From a policy standpoint, the Fed continues to view labor risks as balanced, according to BlackRock’s strategists. Recent data echo some downside concerns flagged by Chair Jerome Powell, but do not signal a major breakdown in employment conditions, they stated. With 175 basis points of cuts already implemented since September 2024 and policy rates approaching neutral, BlackRock sees limited room for aggressive easing in 2026. Further cuts would depend on a sharp labor market decline, which they do not expect. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

Title: Here’s How High Bitcoin Price Would Be At Gold’s ATH Market Cap
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/how-high-bitcoin-price-gold/
Time Published: 2025-12-24T14:30:47Z
Full Content:
Gold has reached unprecedented price levels at the end of 2025, breaking above $4,525 per ounce and setting fresh all-time highs as Bitcoin price continues to struggle. That surge has pushed gold’s total market capitalization to levels that dwarf the value of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. This difference between gold, the established safe-haven asset and Bitcoin, a growing digital store of value, invites a provocative question: if BTC’s total valuation equaled gold’s peak market cap, what price would BTC have to reach? Gold’s rally in 2025 captured global attention as prices climbed past $4,500 per ounce for the first time, setting a new record that reflects more than just short-term speculation. Gold’s strength this year is not just about price per ounce. In market-cap terms, gold has added about $12 trillion in value since the start of 2025 alone. That single-year increase in gold’s market capitalization is around seven times larger than the entire Bitcoin market cap. This recent all-time high price has helped boost gold’s total market capitalization to an estimated $31.1 trillion, based on the total value of above-ground gold stocks multiplied by the elevated price per ounce. Bitcoin’s market capitalization currently stands at $1.736 trillion, based on a circulating supply of just under 20 million BTC. Unlike gold, BTC’S total valuation has not increased this year. Instead, it has shrunk by roughly $100 billion since January 1, with its price now struggling in the mid-$80,000s. Market Cap Of Gold And Bitcoin. Source: Companiemarketcap.com Put simply, Bitcoin is only a small slice of gold’s valuation. At today’s levels, gold’s $31 trillion market cap means that Bitcoin fits into gold roughly 18 times over. This ratio is a good reference point for Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential, given its reputation as a digital version of gold. If Bitcoin were to match gold’s $31 trillion market capitalization, the corresponding price per BTC would be considerably higher than current levels. Using a circulating supply of about 19.96 million BTC, BTC would need to push to approximately $1.55 million per coin to reach parity with gold’s current all-time-high market cap. The amount of capital inflow needed for BTC to reach this price level is massive and unprecedented. Still, many Bitcoin maximalists believe this scenario is not unrealistic over an extended timeframe. Michael Saylor, one of Bitcoin’s most vocal advocates, has proposed that BTC will eventually surpass gold in total market value within the next 10 years. In a November interview, Saylor said he has “no doubt” that BTC will become a larger asset class than gold by 2035. It is obvious that 2025 is about to be a red year for Bitcoin and the entire crypto market. However, 2026 could play out as a recovery and normalization year. Recovery in this context does not imply explosive upside, but a period where bearish price action is worked off and confidence in BTC is rebuilt gradually.

Title: US unemployment claims fall again last week, remain at historically healthy level

By MATT OTT, Associated Press Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week and remain at historically healthy levels despite some signs that the labor market is weakening. U.S. applications for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 20 fell by 10,000 to 214,000 from the previous week’s 224,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. That’s below the 232,000 new applications forecast of analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet. The weekly report was released a day early due to the Christmas holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Last week, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls. Hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon, but those workforce reductions can take months to show up in the government’s data. The Labor Department’s report Wednesday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 750 to 216,750. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 13 rose by 38,000 to 1.92 million, the government said.

Applicants line up at a job fair at the Ocean Casino Resort in Atlantic City N.J., on April 11, 2022. (AP Photo/Wayne Parry, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week and remain at historically healthy levels despite some signs that the labor market is weakening. U.S. applications for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 20 fell by 10,000 to 214,000 from the previous week’s 224,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. That’s below the 232,000 new applications forecast of analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet. The weekly report was released a day early due to the Christmas holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Last week, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of U.S. government payrolls.

AIBiggest DisappointmentsKotaku 2025LayoffsMindsEyeTariffsTrump I’d hoped 2025 would be a better year than 2024. And in some personal ways, it was. But it was also yet another year filled with layoffs, AI slop, greedy execs, price increases, and more signs that the entire game industry is collapsing. So, like we’ve done in years past, Kotaku has rounded up a collection of some of the worst, most disappointing video game news and events from 2025 and catalogued it in a handy dandy list. Take breaks as you scroll through this, and let’s all hope 2026 is better. It can’t be worse, right? Please, tell me it can’t be worse. Please… This was the year in which, more than ever before, a lot of big games got canned, or we learned about projects that were binned not long ago. Perfect Dark, the slick-looking reboot of Rare’s sci-fi shooter series? Canned, and the studio behind it shuttered. A Wonder Woman game from Monolith? Canceled taking the beloved studio behind No One Lives Forever and Shadow of Mordor down with it. An EA-published Black Panther game from some former Monolith devs that would have reportedly featured a version of Mordor’s popular Nemesis System? Dead and the studio behind it closed, too. EA also shelved a Titanfall extraction shooter spin-off; Sony killed a few live-service games, including a God of War multiplayer project; and a cool-looking Transformers game from Splash Damage got the axe this year, leading to, you guessed it, layoffs. And these are just the ones that we know about. I’d bet a lot more games were canceled in 2025 as publishers continue to focus more and more on fewer franchises that can be reliably counted on to turn a profit. And as noted, many of these cancellations led to layoffs and studios being closed, a problem worth talking about separately, because in 2025, these cuts and closings happened a lot.Â 2025 wasnât as bad for industry layoffs as 2024, but it was still pretty terrible. Nearly 10,000 developers lost jobs, according to layoff tracker Amir Satvat. Thatâs down from the over 15,000 pink-slips peak of 2025, but still up from 2022. The big cutbacks were once again at Microsoft, which shaved hundreds of jobs across its gaming division, including at Rare, Zenimax, and King.Â But those were hardly the only ones. Notable teams like Cloud Chamber, working on BioShock 4, lost dozens of staff, Amazon Gaming cut over 100 positions, and Square Enix made cuts across its international publishing business. Indies were also still hit hard. Heart Machine had to lay people off and end Hyper Light Breaker Early Access development early, while Wreckreation maker Three Fields Entertainment turned to Patreon as it looks for new funding.Â Randomly looking up the developer behind Floppy Knights to see what they were working on next, only to find a shutdown notice on their homepage, pretty much summed up the ongoing industry vibe.Â – Ethan Gach Generative AI isn’t new tech. It’s been floating around for a few years now. But in 2025, it felt like AI popped up more than ever across different games and studios. Swen Vincke, the head ofÂ Baldur’s Gate 3Â maker Larian Studios, stepped into it big time in December after he sounded shockingly bullish on AI generation tools. And Vincke wasn’t alone. Plenty of other video game executives and bosses had lots of positive things to say about AI generation tools. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II director Daniel VÃ¡vra is all for AI usage if it lets his studio make games faster. Chris Cocks, the CEO of D&D parent company Hasbro, said AI is “supercharging fandom.” Nexon CEO Junghun Lee, whose company owns the studio behind Arc Raiders, said in an interview that it’s “important to assume that every game company is now using AI,â and that other companies needed to rely on the tech to “increase [their] competitiveness.” Helldivers 2 boss Shams Jorjani thinks people are being too quick to dismiss AI and called Arc Raiders‘ use of the tech interesting, adding that in his view the tech “actually makes gaming better.â Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino reportedly said that it’s “becoming common sense in the creative world to rely on the power of AI to boost work efficiency.” Level-5 is the studio behind Professor Layton and Ni No Kuni.Â The gung-ho attitude so many gaming execs and bosses have toward gen AI tools likely explains how ugly, wonky AI slop keeps ending up in big video games, including Battlefield 6, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7,Â Anno 117: Pax Romana,Â and others. And despite players almost universally being against AI art and other slop, this trend isn’t going away in 2026. PUBG publisher Krafton plans to spend nearly $70 million on becoming an “AI-first” company. Ubisoft, meanwhile, is investing a lot into leveraging the controversial tech into its future video games, even showing off an FPS that was built entirely around AI tech. The shit has even worked its way into stuff like GZDoom and television show recaps. This is our future. It fucking sucks, and until the AI bubble pops, we all will have to put up with more slop in 2026, so greedy execs can make the line go up more by replacing devs and artists with AI chatbots and hoping gamers eventually get over it. It’s never been cheap to play video games. But in 2025, this already expensive hobby became even more pricey. As noted by Stephen Totilo over at Game File, since April, there have been eight price hikes total from Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft on consoles, accessories, and subscriptions. This is likely one big reason why console sales were in the gutter in November. And even if you tried to buy a used Xbox or PS5 to save money, it would still likely be more expensive than that same console would have cost at launch in 2020. Meanwhile, Nintendo became the first publisher to break a shocking price barrier when it announced that Switch 2 launch title Mario Kart World would be priced at $80. Later, Xbox announced that The Outer Worlds 2 would also be $80, but the backlash was so strong that it relented and lowered the price to $70. However, Xbox didn’t back down on raising prices on Game Pass and turned the service, once called the best deal in gaming by many, intoÂ a more complicated and expensive subscription service. Sony raised prices on PlayStation Plus as well. Perhaps you decide to skip consoles entirely, build a PC, and take advantage of all the great deals on stores like Steam and GOG. Well, thanks to a number of factors, including tech companies gobbling up parts for AI usage and President Trump’s idiotic tariffs, RAM and other PC parts are becoming more and more expensive. And this also means that PC handhelds, like the Steam Deck and ROG Ally, will likely cost more when newer versions are announced, and prices on existing models will probably increase. Valve has also announced that it is done making the cheapest version of the Steam Deck, which isn’t good news for folks looking for an affordable and accessible entry into PC gaming. I mean, none of this is good news, and with rumors swirling that next-gen machines will be expensive behemoths, I’d recommend gamers start saving up money as we enter 2026. Itâs been five months since Steam and itch.io began purging certain NSFW games from their storefronts following pressure from payment processors like Mastercard. Despite an immediate backlash and ongoing calls not to let banks censor art, tons of games remain unavailable to purchase on the worldâs biggest PC gaming storefronts. The worst part of all is that itâs still not even clear who the corporate partners are trying to appease with the crackdown. The message to potential censorship advocates is that if you make enough noise, controversy-averse companies will back down. – Ethan Gach Electronic Arts is probably not anyoneâs favorite publisher, given itâs responsible for turning some beloved IPs into live-service slop and gutting certain teams under its umbrella after undermining them for decades, but nobody wants to see a company bought out by the Saudi government. Though EA claims it will maintain creative freedom after the $55 billion deal is signed, sealed, and delivered, all it takes is one person from on high to say that BioWare canât include queer relationships in Mass Effect 5 or that The Sims is now going to focus exclusively on the nuclear family for all of that independence to go away. EA can put on a brave face all it wants, but this is bleak, and a lot of good developers and stories are likely going to suffer for it.Â – Kenneth Shepard There was a lot of buzz around Mindseye, the first game from longtime Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies’ indie video game studio. It was going to be a GTA-like semi-open-world action game that tied into a larger suite of online game creation tools that people could use to build their own experiences, ala Roblox or Fortnite. Instead, what Mindseye ended up being when it launched earlier this year was a complete disaster. It was extremely buggy, ran like crap, was filled with boring missions, and felt sterile and empty. It was easily one of the worst games of the year, and it likely jeopardizes the future of Benzies’ studio and other projects. The Trump administration turning fascist propaganda into the stuff of memes isnât terribly surprising, but itâs disappointing that some of the biggest companies in video games just let him use their IP to do it. Microsoft and The PokÃ©mon Company both saw their creations used in posts from the Trump administration trying to recruit nerds to join ICE, and while The PokÃ©mon Company said it hadn’t given permission for the use of its work, it stopped short of condemning the video post of ICE agents âcatchingâ immigrants set to the iconic anime theme song from the â90s. Microsoft, meanwhile, didnât say a goddamn word. With the current administration being this brain-rotted and online, I imagine most people want to just keep their heads down and not put the spotlight on themselves for longer than they have to. But if Sabrina Carpenter can tell Trump to eat shit, so can you, Master Chief. – Kenneth Shepard 2024 was a bad year for physical media, and 2025 just brought more bad news on that front. Some physical game releases on the Switch 2, the hottest new console around, make use of Game Key Cards, which are basically little pieces of plastic that don’t contain the game, but instead a digital DRM key that lets you download and play a specific game. They rely on the internet and Nintendo’s servers, and that should make everyone nervous. Meanwhile, I walked into a Target to do some Christmas shopping and discovered that my local store has just stopped selling Xbox games. The Outer Worlds 2 skipped a physical Xbox release entirely. And PlayStation made only 3 percent of its total profits in 2024 from physical game sales. Yikes. While physical games aren’t going away entirely in 2026, it does seem like the era of stores filled with aisles of games to buy is long gone. Grand Theft Auto 6, possibly the most highly anticipated video game release in a decade, suffered two more delays in 2025. Originally, Rockstar’s long-awaited open-world crime sim was supposed to launch this year, with many anticipating a fall arrival. But in the spring, the game was delayed until May 2026. Fans were given a second trailer to make up for the delay and marked the new date on their calendars. And then, about six months later, Rockstar announced another delay, pushing GTA 6 back all the way until November 2026. Of course, this wasn’t the most disappointing news to come from Rockstar Games in 2025. No, that would be the union-busting accusations leveled against the company after it fired over two dozen employees for allegedly sharing confidential information on Discord. The staff who were fired deny these allegations and, with the support of the Independent Workersâ Union of Great Britain, continued to protest at Rockstar’s offices. This whole situation has blown up so much that the UK’s Prime Minister has openly called out Rockstar Games and demanded further investigation. It’s clear this isn’t going away like Rockstar Games likely hoped, and when (if?) GTA 6 finally launches in 2026, the company’s firing of these employees will likely be a hot topic among the press and fans. Donât miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

Title: Timothée Chalamet, a Neil Diamond tribute band and more in theaters for Christmas

By Bob Mondello , Stephen Thompson Timothée Chalamet in Marty Supreme. A24 hide caption A ping pong hustler for the ages, a Neil Diamond interpreter for the '80s, choral music both comic and spiritual, plus tormented teens, twisted families, and a giant snake on the loose. It's quite the jolly holiday at your local cineplex. They join a new Avatar sequel, a Bradley Cooper-directed drama, and more in theaters. In theaters Thursday I feel as if I should tell you to speed-read this review, preferably with Fats Domino's "The Fat Man" blaring in your ear. Josh Safdie's adrenaline-fueled, screwball comedy about a table tennis hustler who dreams of world domination — in a sport that hasn't registered yet with the American public — is a mesmerizing cinematic tour de force. Timothée Chalamet plays Marty Mauser (loosely based on real-life 1940s and '50s U.S. ping pong champ and petty criminal Marty Reisman), graduating from determined kid-with-a-passion to aggrieved also-ran-in-full-melt-down mode, attracting and then alienating everyone he comes across. We meet him as a New York shoe salesman having storeroom trysts with his married childhood sweetheart (Odessa A'zion) and prepping for a bout in England for which he can't even afford plane fare. Marty establishes with a series of heists and scams that he's got no problem cheating or stealing to get there, then regales the press with a pugnacious racist routine that lands him on front pages before his first serve. Chalamet's live-wire approach is neatly countered by a serenely sensual turn by Gwyneth Paltrow as an aging movie star who finds Marty amusing and alarming in about equal measure. And the film's just getting started at that point, careening towards a championship in Japan with the propulsive, harrowing, rush-to-judgment feel of Safdie's Uncut Gems mixed up with dizzying comedy. It's a thrill ride, pure and simple. — Bob Mondello In theaters Thursday Mike and Claire Sardina, the real-life, blue-collar Milwaukee couple who formed a Neil Diamond tribute act in the 1980s, get the sequin-and-spangle treatment in this Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson love-fest. Writer and director Craig Brewer keeps the music central and the sentiment tolerable as the couple meets cute, bonds quick, and forms a musical act known professionally as Lightning and Thunder. The stars are well-matched and appealing — Hudson does a winning Patsy Cline impersonation, and Jackman completely nails Neil Diamond's sound and bearing. The couple's story, which has more downs than ups, doesn't quite match the mood of a movie determined to be ever-and-always-up. Still, the stars are engaging, the supporting cast great fun, and the music rousing. — Bob Mondello Whether you plan to head out to the theater or binge from the couch, our critics have gathered together their favorite films and TV shows of 2025. In theaters Thursday The original Anaconda movie came out almost 30 years ago, sending an assortment of '90s movie stars down the Amazon, where they were menaced and occasionally crushed and/or devoured by giant deadly snakes. That film, starring Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube, was a hit that spawned a handful of lightly regarded sequels. Heavy on meta references to the original film, the new Anaconda is not quite a reboot, it's not quite a sequel, and it's played for laughs. Jack Black and Paul Rudd star as lifelong friends who grew up wanting to be filmmakers. But they've followed different career paths — Paul Rudd's character is a struggling actor whose biggest role was a bit part on the TV show S.W.A.T., while Jack Black's character makes wedding videos while yearning to shoot something more creative. They gather their old friends and collaborators — played by Thandiwe Newton and Steve Zahn — and head to the Amazon to shoot a meta reimagining of Anaconda. As you can imagine, this proves harder than it sounds. — Stephen Thompson In limited theaters Wednesday The first image is an eerie, underwater shot — sun-dappled blues, greens, and greys — its peace suddenly exploded as bodies plunge into the pool. Middle school boys, limbs all akimbo, almost literally at sea, as they struggle for equilibrium. It's an apt beginning for the story of a youngster trying to figure out where he fits in among the cliques at a summer water polo camp. Ben (Everett Blunck) is the camp newbie, Jake (Kayo Martin) its smirking cool kid who picks up on his fellow campers' idiosyncrasies and exploits them. He tells Ben that Eli (Kenny Rasmussen), a withdrawn boy with a rash, has the "plague" and must be avoided. Ben, seeing the obvious pain the outcast is in, can't square that with his own sense of decency, but also doesn't want to be ostracized, and his attempt to split the difference leads the film into Lord of the Flies territory. Charlie Polinger's directorial debut looks breathtaking, feels unnerving, and traffics cleverly in body-horror tropes as it basically establishes that 12-year-old boys are savages who should never be without adult supervision. — Bob Mondello In limited theaters Wednesday You might expect Jim Jarmusch to look at family relationships with a certain eccentricity, but not necessarily in the elegantly framed way he does in this triptych about adult children and the parents they don't begin to understand. The Father segment casts Adam Driver and Mayim Bialik as siblings who are stiff with each other, and even less comfortable with their garrulous con man of a dad (Tom Waits). Driver's come with provisions and cash, Bialik's come armed with an arched eyebrow, and Waits is ready for them both. The second part, Mother, finds a sublimely chilly Charlotte Rampling hosting an awkward once-a-year tea for her daughters, one primly nervous (Cate Blanchett), the other pink-haired and boisterous (Vicky Krieps). And the final third, Sister Brother, finds Indya Moore and Luka Sabbat bonding in their recently deceased parents' now-empty Paris apartment. This segment seems less about estrangement, until you realize how little they actually know about their dear departed folks. There are running jokes about Rolexes, the expression "Bob's your uncle," and toasts to tie things together, along with a sweet, reflective tone that makes this one of the year's most compassionate films. — Bob Mondello In limited theaters Thursday Director Nicholas Hytner and screenwriter Alan Bennett, who previously teamed up on The Madness of King George, The History Boys, and The Lady in the Van, are plumbing shallower depths in this gentle dramedy about an amateur chorus in 1916. When their choirmaster leaves to fight in World War I, grieving mill owner Roger Allam, who funds the chorus, reluctantly hires Dr. Guthrie (Ralph Fiennes), a gifted choirmaster but a divisive choice in this intensely nationalistic moment — because he's spent the last few years in Germany. He also exhibits "peculiarities" (code for being gay) but this seems less important to the locals. Fiennes is briskly dismissive of local traditions, snippy about English appreciation for the arts, and celebrated enough in music circles to persuade composer Edward Elgar (Simon Russell Beale) to let them perform his oratorio "The Dream of Gerontius." Elgar is less thrilled when he discovers the chorus is turning the oratorio into a story about the war, casting its elderly hero as a young soldier and generally making it what later generations would call "relevant." It's all sweet and sentimental, and though it's being released during awards seasons, feels as if it really wants to be considered for best picture of 1933. — Bob Mondello In select theaters Thursday "I've got it all," says paper factory supervisor Man-su as he hugs his family at a barbecue in the backyard of his elegant Korean home. He's grilling some eels given to him by the paper company's new American owners, secure in the knowledge that this must mean they value him. This being a social satire by director Park Chan-wook, it's reasonable to expect he will shortly be dealt a blow, and one day later, he's been axed. (The film is based on Donald E. Westlake's 1997 horror-thriller novel The Ax). He's distraught but can't express, or even really understand, that he feels he has lost his manhood, his mojo, and his reason for being. On top of that, his industry is consolidating, so finding another job before his severance pay runs out and he loses his house (his childhood home) will be tricky. Asked if he'd consider a job outside the paper industry, Man-su (Lee Byung-hun) says that for him there is "no other choice," echoing the words his American bosses uttered about bringing down costs as they did layoffs. But with the end of severance payments looming, he hatches a plan to knock off his job market competition one by one. Isn't this mass murder? Well, he has "no other choice." At first it seems as if we're in serial-killer comedy territory, but the filmmaker widens the frame to include narrative side trips — a stepson who's stealing cellphones, a daughter who's a cello prodigy, a wife who's working for a dentist that Man-su suspects has designs on her. Oh, and pig-farm trauma from his youth, and a passion for greenhouse gardening. Director Park has a lot going on, and a final paper-plant-mechanization sequence suggests that all these stabs at human agency may just have been humanity's last gasp. — Bob Mondello In limited theaters Thursday Ambitious, stylized, intense, and thoroughly unorthodox, Mona Fastvold's religious biopic tells the story of Shakers founder Ann Lee (a wild-eyed, fiercely committed Amanda Seyfried) as a full-scale musical drama. That's not to say there are finger-snapping tunes. The score adapts 18th century Shaker spirituals, and the choreography involves the thrusting limbs and clawing fingers of the seizure-like dancing that earned this puritan sect of "Shaking" Quakers their nickname. We meet Ann as a pious youngster more interested in spiritual matters than matters of the flesh. Marriage to a man who enjoys inflicting pain during sex, and the deaths of her four children in infancy lead Ann to the conclusion that lifelong celibacy is among the keys to salvation. With the help of her younger brother (Lewis Pullman), she finds adherents to a religious philosophy that also emphasizes gender equality and simple living, and leads them to found a utopian, crafts-based community in America. Director Fastvold and her co-writer Brady Corbet (the couple flipped roles from last year's The Brutalist) serve up Ann's spiritual journey in ecstatically musical terms, which is at once distancing and … well, ecstatic, though it pales a bit over the course of two-and-a-quarter hours. — Bob Mondello Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

For the most recent STANDARDIZED AND MONTH-END PERFORMANCE, please click on the ETF ticker below: Each Fund has a limited operating history, and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. Note: CRSH, DIPS, FIAT, WNTR and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs.” Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). 1 All YieldMax® ETFs shown in the table have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%.2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on December 23, 2025. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gains, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future.3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ending November 30, 2025, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period.4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF.5 ROC refers to Return of Capital. The ROC percentage indicates how much the distribution reflects an investor's initial investment. The figures shown for each Fund in the table above are estimates and may later be determined to be taxable net investment income, short-term gains, long-term gains (to the extent permitted by law), or return of capital. Actual amounts and sources for tax reporting will depend upon the Fund's investment activities during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Your broker will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year to tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information This material must be preceded or accompanied by the prospectus. For all prospectuses, click here. Tidal Investments, LLC is the adviser for all YieldMax® ETFs. THE FUND, TRUST, AND ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Referenced Index Risk. The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Index (or the Index ETFs). This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of companies that comprised the Index or an ETF that tracks the Index, even though it does not. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Investors in the Fund will not have the right to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the companies that comprise the Index but will be subject to declines in the performance of the Index. Russell 2000 Index Risks. The Index, which consists of small-cap U.S. companies, is particularly susceptible to economic changes, as these firms often have less financial resilience than larger companies. Market volatility can disproportionately affect these smaller businesses, leading to significant price swings. Additionally, these companies are often more exposed to specific industry risks and have less diverse revenue streams. They can also be more vulnerable to changes in domestic regulatory or policy environments. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA, CVNA, HOOD, BRK.B, DKNG, RBLX, RDDT, GME, HIMS, CRCL), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting, and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Shorting Risk. The Fund may enter into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed (typically from a broker or other institution). If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a (potentially unlimited) loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. In certain cases, purchasing a security to cover a short position can itself cause the price of the security to rise further, thereby exacerbating the loss. In addition, the Fund may not always be able to borrow the security at a particular time or at an acceptable price. The Fund may also take a short position synthetically through use of derivatives. Synthetic short positions, achieved through derivatives such as options, additionally expose the Fund to the inherent risks of derivatives (described above). These combined risks can result in greater losses for the Fund than those associated with direct short sales, potentially preventing the Fund from achieving its investment objective. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA, MSTR), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: The 20-Year Signal: Preparing for the Predicted Reversal of AI-Fueled Stock Market Gains

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © chayanuphol / Shutterstock.com There is no question that artificial intelligence has transformed the stock market as we know it over the past three years, all but single-handedly driving the S&P 500 to record after record. Companies that are sitting at the forefront of this technology, like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), have delivered returns that seemed impossible just a few years ago. Most importantly, the AI technology is real, and so far, the enthusiasm for this technology has been mostly justified, all while the long-term potential (and dangers) seems incredible. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolios have grown in a massive way over the last 36 months. But, and there is always a but, beneath this celebratory growth, there is a warning signal that has emerged. This indicator, which looks at the close relationships between stock prices and underlying economics, hasn’t flashed at current levels in over 20 years, not since the dot-com bubble that burst in the early 2000s. The last time this signal appeared, it was followed by a multi-year bear market that erased roughly half of the market’s overall value. While history doesn’t always repeat itself, it does at least suggest that we need to look at these readings and consider, as investors, what the next smart move really is. The artificial intelligence revolution has, without question, captivated investors in a way that almost no other technology has. The belief that AI is going to and has already started to automate work, revolutionize manufacturing, and create entirely new industries is just scratching the surface of what investors are thinking about. For companies that are in the AI world, all of this speculation and promise has led to explosive revenue growth. For example, NVIDIA’s data center business has become one of the fastest-growing divisions in corporate America, and Microsoft’s AI integration across basically its entire product lineup is driving enterprise adoption. In other words, this technology is actually driving real revenue. This technological transformation has driven stock prices to levels that would have seemed absurd three years ago. The S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022, and NVIDIA has seen its market cap grow by trillions. The Mag 7’s technology stocks represent a whopping 30% of the entire S&P 500 market value, a level not seen since the 1990s. Valuations have also exploded as the forward P/E of the S&P 500 now hovers around 21 to 22, 40% above historical averages. The optimism that is driving these valuation numbers is assuming that AI will continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth for years to come. More importantly, it also assumes that AI adoption won’t have any obstacles to adoption in the coming years and that companies building AI infrastructure will continue generating returns to justify their current high stock prices and valuations. This pattern of pricing in future success isn’t new, as the late 1990s boom also seemed a trajectory where investors were basically paying today for profits they expected companies to deliver in the next five years. However, as the world knows, the technology of the internet boom from the 1990s succeeded, it’s how you’re reading this today, but many of the stocks crashed because valuations got too far ahead of any financial reality. The warning signal that is flashing today is the Shiller CAPE ratio, a number that is an adjusted price-to-earnings ratio that measures stock prices relative to average inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. This metric attempts to smooth out short-term earnings volatility and give a longer-lens look at valuation extremes. As of December 2025, the Shiller CAPE sits above 35, a level that has only been seen twice in modern history: the Great Depression market crash and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak. The last time the US saw the CAPE ratio reach these current levels was in early 2000, right before the stock-market crash. At that peak, investors were paying extreme premiums for stocks based on the expectation (think hope) that internet companies would continue to just deliver on their unprecedented growth. History reminds us that the reality of what took place was that these companies did not enjoy unstoppable growth and that the market declined 49% over a 2.5-year period, the NASDAQ fell 78%, and it took 7 years to recover. The CAPE ratio’s predictive power comes from understanding long-term perspectives, and unlike traditional P/E ratios that can be distorted by temporary earnings spikes or collapses, the CAPE ratio looks with a wide lens at a full decade of earnings. When this ratio does hit 30, it can be a historical signal that stocks are priced for perfection and have almost no room for disappointment. What makes the current signal particularly troubling is that it isn’t just existing in a silo. Instead, it’s appearing alongside three other late-cycle indicators like three consecutive years of double-digit S&P 500 gains, forward P/E ratios at 40-year highs, extreme concentration in a handful of mega-cap stocks, and retail investor enthusiasm that feels eerily like the dot-com bubble. While no single indicator is going to be definitive, the combination of all three suggests that a major reversal could be on the horizon, and an entire generation of investors has never experienced what happens when valuations are this stretched. History is pretty unambiguous about what can happen when an extreme CAPE reading is taking place. For one, you might be in a position that creates a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity. At the 1929 stock peak, stocks fell 89% over three years, and again in 2000, you had the 49% S&P 500 drop over 2.5 years. What a drop might look like in the near future is unknown, but the pattern that occurred during these two previous instances of extreme valuations resolving through major corrections seems to be all too familiar to what we’re going through now with AI. For investors, this could be the strategic opportunity they have been waiting for rather than a situation full of panic. The mistake during previous bubbles wasn’t recognizing that stocks were not expensive, but it was remaining fully invested at those prices and then panic-selling at the bottom. The smart approach today is about recognizing that current valuations create a situation where the downside potential far exceeds any upside of staying fully invested. Building a cash reserve now so investors can “buy the dip,” as the saying goes, is arguably the best move, to the tune of upward of 30% of a portfolio being liquidated for cash or put into short-term bonds. If the market does decline by 40-50% from current levels, this cash can be invested into companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA at valuations these companies haven’t experienced in years. This could give investors a chance to double their position size. The key here is going to be the right amount of discipline, as history shows that bear market pain isn’t the actual decline itself, it’s the psychology of trying to understand how to buy at the bottom. If the market falls 30%, there might be a voice going on that says it’s going to 50% and if it falls 50%, total economic collapse might be the voice on the news. In other words, investors should have capital reserved for buying during these panics so they can ignore the noise and acquire quality companies at steep discounts and prepare for the next decade’s best returns.

Good morning. The holidays feel like a good time to check in with Ariane Gorin, CEO of Expedia Group. 2025 has been a banner year for travel and for Expedia, which saw its revenues rise 7.6% to $13.4 billion in the 12 months ending Sept. 30, with its stock up more than 50% so far this year. In the latest episode of Fortune’s Leadership Next, Gorin spoke to me and Kristin Stoller about the evolving travel landscape and how she’s leading in this tricky climate. AI is reshaping the travel experience as many of us turn to large language models to plan and even pay for trips. That presents both an opportunity and a potential threat for leaders like Gorin—and Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel, with whom we spoke earlier this year. The opportunity: to deploy AI internally and forge partnerships that embed the group’s Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo functionality within the LLMs. The risk: hallucinations, privacy violations, and the specter of LLMs reducing the need for travel sites or turning them into invisible pipes that consumers never see. “We’ve been working for years with Google and Bing … and now it’s about deepening our partnerships,” said Gorin, adding that AI has enabled innovation like Expedia’s new trip-matching feature that turns Instagram reels into bookable travel experiences. “It’s been quite fun to challenge ourselves to say, ‘how do we make sure that our brands are showing up well there?’” Gorin also talks about building up Brand USA among foreigners during this delicate time when former stalwarts (hello, Canada!) may be staying away and events from the World Cup to America’s 250th anniversary are expected to boost tourism. Her approach is to start with telling the story that Americans are “making it welcoming, that we’re making the infrastructure welcoming, we’re making it easy to come to the country.” That’s a message many leaders would love to rally around.

As always, we welcome your thoughts and appreciate you reading what we write.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com U.S. sends more troops to the Caribbean Large numbers of ships, special-operations aircraft, troops, and equipment are being amassed by the U.S. military in the Caribbean in a buildup to a potential attack on Venezuela, which may include airstrikes on Venezuelan soil. “We have a massive armada formed, the biggest we’ve ever had, and by far the biggest we’ve ever had in South America,” President Trump said. “Soon we will be starting the same program on land.” Trump wants to force Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro out of office. Trump flew on Epstein’s plane more often than thought The U.S. Justice Department released thousands more documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, and many made mention of President Donald Trump. None of them describe wrongdoing. But one email, from an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, said flight records showed Trump used Epstein’s jet “many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware).” There are 700,000 more pages of Epstein material on the way—so expect the headlines on this issue to last another week. Epstein sought Wall Street giants as executors of his will The Epstein documents show that the late financier hoped that high-powered Wall Street execs would be the executors of his estate. He named Jimmy Cayne, the former CEO of Bear Stearns; Jes Staley, formerly of JPMorgan and an ex-CEO of Barclays, Goldman Sachs legal chief Kathryn Ruemmler, and former Treasury secretary Larry Summers as executors in various versions of his will. It is not clear that any of them knew they were named by Epstein. Big Tech companies have $120 billion in off-balance sheet debt Meta, xAI, Oracle, CoreWeave and others have moved $120 billion in spending on AI data centers off their balance sheets and into special-purpose vehicles or private credit entities funded by Pimco, BlackRock, Apollo, Blue Owl Capital , JPMorgan, and others, according to a Financial Times analysis. U.S. GDP fueled mostly by AI U.S. GDP grew 4.3% in Q3, far surpassing expectations, but most of that growth comes from one thing: AI data centers. Pantheon Macroeconomics said that private fixed investment—a measure of how much companies are spending—“is rising only due to AI-related spending.” All other private fixed investment is actually in decline. Deutsche Bank said, “Investment in AI-related sectors is critical to GDP growth [and the] U.S. would be close to recession this year if it weren’t for tech-related spending.” Trump Administration bans former EU commissioner from entering the U.S. Thierry Breton, the former European Union commissioner who backed the Digital Services Act, and four anti-disinformation campaigners have been banned from entering the U.S. “The State Department is taking decisive action against five individuals who have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. The DSA bans U.S. tech platforms from targeting users with data based on gender, race, religion, or age. Targeting children with ads will also be prohibited. It also requires platforms to take down content that incites terrorism or child sexual abuse. Progress in Ukraine-Russia peace talks Ukraine’s President Zelensky is hopeful he can persuade the U.S. to support a proposal that would halt Russia’s war along the current contact lines. Russia has suggested it could pull back troops from some areas, Zelensky said, but Ukraine is reluctant to cede territory it controls. S&P 500 futures were flat this morning.

Title: Crypto Won In 2025—But Bitcoin Fell. Can They Rise to the Occasion?

The rise and subsequent retreat of bitcoin perfectly encapsulates the crypto industry's year. It won big—but it doesn't have much to show for it yet. The price of bitcoin, the world's most well-known cryptocurrency, soared above $126,000, a record, but those gains evaporated and it's poised to finish down for 2025. The industry welcomed the passage of stablecoin legislation, eased regulation, and the proliferation of new ways to buy in, but by many measures it has yet to reap the benefits. Despite all this, plenty of reasons for optimism regarding the both sector and the currencies themselves remain. Next year could be when the effects of institutional buy-in and regulatory shift will start to show, crypto watchers say. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) could break out of its rut to book new highs, experts say, while altcoins could get a regulatory boost. And interest in "tokens"—the digital representation of assets like the dollar or stocks—could take off, further extending the investing world into digital space. "If you talk to retail crypto, the vibe is extraordinarily negative. They look at their world, which extends out a few weeks in time, and see dark clouds—and so they're selling," Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise Asset Management told Investopedia. "And then if you talk to institutional investors, they're just unremittingly bullish." The crypto industry has said that regulation was holding back its potential and that it would upend and replace the existing financial system. Now that a crypto-friendly administration has paved the way, investors are waiting for some of those promised developments to be realized. Bitcoin's supporters see reasons for optimism in the broader outlook for markets in 2026. The prospect of lower interest rates is generally beneficial to risk assets and could both fuel retail appetite for and institutional investor interest in crypto. The coming wave of capital implied by major financial institutions like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch offering access to crypto ETFs to their clients, and big university endowments like those of Harvard and Brown buying in, could also lift bitcoin next year, Hougan said. He expects institutional demand to outpace new supply in the years to come. Since crypto ETFs launched in 2024, they have bought more than 700,000 bitcoin, roughly twice the number of new coins produced by the Bitcoin network over the same period, according to a Bitwise report. The so-called debasement trade—in which investors seek hedges, such as crypto or other assets, against high government debt and a declining dollar—may also come back into play, drawing investor interest next year. "For individuals investing against or hedging their debasement risk, bitcoin makes a lot of sense," Amberdata's director of derivatives Greg Magadini said. Bitcoin's permabulls broadly expect prices to continue to go higher—if not next year, then by the end of the decade. Standard Chartered, for example, sees it hitting $500,000 by 2030. The nearer term outlook for the cryptocurrency, however, is muddier. Galaxy Digital, a financial services firm focused on digital assets, in its 2026 outlook said bitcoin will hit $250,000 by the end of 2027 but called next year "too chaotic to predict." (That generally tracks with the outlooks of some stock-focused analysts, who think the S&P could rise next year but perhaps not smoothly.) Enthusiasm for crypto has led related businesses to stock exchanges amid a revival in initial public offerings. Their collective performance was mixed: Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) hit it big and retained some of its early-won gains, as did Bullish (BLSH). But shares of Winklevoss twins-founded crypto platform Gemini (GEMI) have fallen substantially below their IPO price. (A few well-known firms are eyeing a debut next year.) Strategy (MSTR), the software company that put itself on the map by stockpiling bitcoin, tumbled more than 45% year-to-date. The passage of the CLARITY Act, which provides a framework for regulating crypto in the same way the GENIUS Act did for stablecoins, could also support crypto. David Sacks, the White House's adviser on crypto and artificial intelligence, has said "we are closer than ever" to passing the bill. If the bill is signed into law, the outlook for crypto would improve, Hougan said, because it would enshrine the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission, as crypto's oversight agency, considered the industry's preferred outcome. If it doesn't, a less crypto-friendly future administration might take a different approach. The CLARITY Act would set a more solid regulatory foundation for the industry to operate, according to Hougan, and potentially invigorate demand for altcoins like ether and sol. "It's the biggest risk to crypto right now," he said. "People are pricing in a higher probability that market structure legislation won't get passed." Tokens tied to real-world assets, like stablecoins or ones linked to stocks, could also fire up interest in crypto next year, with some crypto experts saying they can can improve the functioning of the financial system. Circle in 2025 saw its USDC stablecoin expand its reach, with its circulating supply jumping more than 50%, according to analytics firm rwa.xyz. SEC Chair Paul Atkins recently predicted that tokenization could transform the financial market sooner rather than later. "It's the way the world will be...maybe not even in 10 years, maybe even a lot less time, maybe a couple of years from now," Atkins told Fox Business. The tokenization of stocks, an opportunity potentially measured in the trillions of dollars, is being tackled by crypto players and at least one of the financial industry's juggernauts. Coinbase Global (COIN), the largest U.S. crypto exchange, which recently unveiled its own token platform (as well as stock trading), and BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, have both made tokenization a strategic priority.

Title: ‘If I can help someone, I will’: the Dublin woman who has been providing Christmas dinners for 39 years

“I won’t be here forever and these people cannot be left without,” said Dubliner Margaret Brown, who has been providing Christmas dinners to those in need and the homeless for almost four decades. Mrs Brown, from Sandycove in south Co Dublin, has been organising the festive feast since 1986 after she and her late mother saw people in a scout hall eating lumpy soup and cold meat while huddled around a gas-fired heater. “Running out of turkey 39 years ago when I first started cooking dinners with my mother, I never thought I would be doing this all these years later,” she said. “But thankfully I can still do this; for how much longer I do not know.” Mrs Brown, who is in her 80s, originally organised her annual Christmas dinners in Blackrock Rugby Club in south Dublin. In the past, high-profile names such as rock band U2 have surprised guests at the annual Christmas dinner when people gathered at the rugby club. Then the Covid-19 pandemic changed everything and forced Mrs Brown and scores of volunteers to turn to making takeout meals instead. Now the new tradition of delivering the five-course feast of a full Christmas dinner, with pudding and mince pies, is here to stay. “I won’t be here forever, but I’ll keep making the dinners with the help of so many wonderful volunteers thanks to donations we receive from food producers,” said Mrs Brown. The numbers she is feeding have surpassed 200, which is normally the cut-off number she and her team can cook for. “The numbers we could provide for filled our list way in advance of the cut-off date,” she said. “There are so many new people, many of whom are younger, not just older individuals who are lonely and homeless, which is shocking.” The 39 years she has been feeding people has passed “in the blink of an eye” and the needs of people have changed in that time. “There have been a lot of changes in social needs over those years and food provisions have to meet those demands,” she said. The team of volunteers will be cooking for 60 people living in Bethany House for the homeless in Dún Laoghaire. There will also be a special meal for Travellers living in Carrickmines who lost several family members in a blaze 10 years ago. [ ‘So long as these people are here, we’ll never starve’: In the queue for Christmas vouchers at Dublin’s Capuchin Day CentreOpens in new window ] “It takes a lot of preparation in the lead-up to Christmas Day, receiving donations, streamlining of cooking times, delivering the food to people, or them calling to the rugby club at specific times and ensuring no one is forgotten,” said Mrs Brown. Her giving has not just been at Christmas. In 2019 she helped repatriate the remains of an Irishman, Joseph Tuohy from Toomevara, Co Tipperary, as he had no known relatives still alive, and helped prepare a funeral for him. Mr Tuohy, who died in his late 80s, was separated from his mother at age five and spent his childhood in orphanages and St Joseph’s Industrial School in Clonmel. He emigrated to London in his late teens and never returned to Ireland, losing contact with his family. He experienced periods of homelessness and illness in London. Mrs Brown was contacted about his case in her capacity as a volunteer for the Friends of the Forgotten Irish Emigrants, who launched an appeal to Mr Tuohy’s relatives and for people to attend his funeral. His ashes were subsequently laid in consecrated ground in Tipperary. “I didn’t set out for my life to be like this, or to become known for trying to help others, but life can be so difficult for so many and if I can help someone I will,” said Mrs Brown.

Title: Extended crypto ETF outflows shows institutions disengaging: Glassnode

Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have recorded sustained outflows since early November, which Glassnode says signals institutional disengagement. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds have seen a prolonged streak of outflows, indicating that institutional investors have disengaged with crypto, said the analytics platform Glassnode. Since early November, the 30-day simple moving average of net flows into US spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs has turned negative, Glassnode said on Tuesday. “This persistence suggests a phase of muted participation and partial disengagement from institutional allocators, reinforcing the broader liquidity contraction across the crypto market,” it added. Flows into crypto ETFs usually lag the spot markets for the tokens, which have been trending down since mid-October. The ETFs are also considered a bellwether for institutional sentiment, which has been a market driver for most of this year but seemingly turned bearish as the wider market has contracted. Coinglass said aggregate Bitcoin ETF flows have been in the red for the past four consecutive trading days. However, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has seen minor inflows over the past week. “Crypto ETF selling pressure is back,” the Kobeissi Letter said on Tuesday. It reported that crypto funds recorded $952 million in outflows last week, and investors have now withdrawn capital in six out of the last ten weeks. Related: BlackRock pins Bitcoin ETF as major theme alongside T-bills, tech stocks Despite the recent outflows, the industry-dominant BlackRock fund has seen $62.5 billion in inflows since inception, eclipsing all rival spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on Saturday that IBIT is the only ETF on Bloomberg’s “2025 Flow Leaderboard” with a negative return for the year. “The real takeaway is that it was sixth place despite the negative return,” he added. Balchunas said that BlackRock’s flagship Bitcoin fund even took in more than the SPDR Gold Shares fund (GLD), which was up 64%.

Title: These Five Key Drivers Could Boost XRP To $5 By 2026, Claims Top Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP, currently the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has recently fallen below the crucial $2 mark amid a broader market correction that has dampened investor sentiment since October. However, market analyst Sam Daodu has identified five critical catalysts that could drive the altcoin to new all-time highs of $5 by 2026. In a detailed report, Daodu emphasized that for XRP to reach $5, multiple specific factors need to work in unison. Each of these catalysts aims to address various barriers that have kept XRP’s price stagnant. At the forefront of Daodu’s analysis is the potential for a BlackRock-backed XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). Since mid-November 2025, spot XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in cumulative inflows. Should BlackRock move forward with its ETF, estimates suggest that inflows could exceed $2 billion. Daodu’s analysis points that such capital influx would not only reshape market demand but would also solidify XRP’s position as the sole cryptocurrency tied to a fully regulated token in the United States, significantly enhancing its case for reaching $5. Next on the list is the evolving significance of Japan within the XRP narrative. Ripple, in collaboration with SBI Holdings, is set to launch RLUSD—Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin—in Japan by the first quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approval. The use of RLUSD on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) can create substantial demand for XRP as a bridge currency, supporting the case for it to reach $5, even if this impact unfolds gradually over time. The third catalyst that Daodu identified is the tokenization of assets. Ripple’s expanded partnership with Archax aims to bring in “hundreds of millions of dollars” in tokenized equity, debt, and funds onto the XRP Ledger by mid-2026. Should the XRP Ledger capture even a modest 5-10% of the tokenized asset settlement market, the demand for XRP would increase significantly, further supporting its goal of reaching $5. In fourth place, macroeconomic policy plays a crucial role in shaping XRP’s upside potential. Anticipated rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) would likely decrease returns on cash and short-term bonds, traditionally driving capital toward riskier assets that offer growth and liquidity. Lastly, recent on-chain data points to a noteworthy change in supply dynamics. Exchange-held XRP has decreased, with 1.35 billion XRP removed from exchanges in less than two months. Balances plummeted from approximately 3.95 billion tokens to about 2.6 billion, with more than a billion leaving in just a short span of three weeks. Such withdrawals are indicative of a behavioral shift among holders, as many are opting to move XRP into long-term storage solutions. Daodu posits that reaching the $5 mark will not stem from a singular headline or moment of exuberance. It will necessitate a convergence of multiple factors, including strong ETF inflows, institutional adoption, and favorable macroeconomic conditions. As of this writing, the altcoin was trading at $1.88, dropping by almost 50% from all-time high levels reached back in July of this year.

Two new exchange-traded funds from Amplify track companies building the infrastructure for stablecoins and tokenization, blending stocks and crypto. Cointelegraph in your social feed Digital asset manager Amplify has launched two exchange-traded funds tracking blockchain projects across stablecoins and tokenization. The company said on Tuesday that its Amplify Stablecoin Technology ETF (STBQ) and Amplify Tokenization Technology ETF (TKNQ) both went live on the NYSE Arca exchange. Both funds track a diversified index of companies working on products or infrastructure, along with projects that generate revenue from tokenization and stablecoins. “These new ETFs expand Amplify’s lineup at a time when the infrastructure behind stablecoins and the growth of tokenization are shaping the next phase of digital finance,” the company said. Stablecoins and tokenization have been among the most popular themes in crypto this year, with the US passing laws that have given institutions confidence to launch stablecoins, and regulators opening dialogue on how they should treat assets such as tokenized stocks. Amplify said its stablecoin-focused ETF tracks shares of companies “generating significant revenue from payments technology, digital asset infrastructure, and trading platforms.” It holds shares in companies working on stablecoins such as Visa, Circle, Mastercard and PayPal, alongside crypto ETFs from Grayscale, iShares and Bitwise. The firm pointed to regulatory developments in the US and EU, noting that the “GENIUS Act in the US and MiCA in Europe are positioning stablecoins as the compliant backbone of digital finance.” Related: Clarity Act delays led to $952M in crypto fund outflows: CoinShares Meanwhile, the tokenization fund includes exposure to BlackRock, JPMorgan, Figure Technology Solution, Citigroup and the Nasdaq, which all have made tokenization plays over the past few years as they seek opportunities to digitize traditional financial services. Crypto and blockchain ETFs stormed onto the market in 2025 after the US Securities and Exchange Commission under chair Paul Atkins loosened requirements for crypto ETFs.

JPMorgan is making another big bet on crypto. The Wall Street giant is considering letting institutional clients trade cryptocurrency, according to reporting on Monday from Bloomberg. These products and services may reportedly include spot and derivatives trading, and the efforts are still in their early stages. JPMorgan did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. The move comes amid the company’s broader embrace of digital assets. In October, the bank announced that it would allow institutional clients to use Bitcoin and Ether as collateral. And earlier in December, JPMorgan’s asset management arm launched its first tokenized money fund. The bank’s recent expansion of crypto is notable given how CEO Jamie Dimon has long expressed contempt for the sector. As recently as last year, Dimon compared Bitcoin to a “pet rock”, and said that its only uses were for money laundering and fraud, among other illegal activities. The remarks followed other insults Dimon has heaped on crypto over the years. JPMorgan’s pivot towards crypto follows President Donald Trump’s more favorable policies toward the sector. In July, Trump signed the Genius Act into law, creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The legislation was enacted as Trump’s family profited from the industry. Given the new regulatory landscape for crypto, other major financial companies have also been hopping on the bandwagon. BlackRock manages close to $100 billion in Bitcoin ETF assets and more than $11 billion in Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, fellow financial giant Fidelity is involved in crypto staking, while Goldman Sachs has a private blockchain that is testing tokenized fund redemptions. And UBS, Citi, and HSBC have participated in tokenized bond issuances, on-chain settlement pilots, and crypto custody services. Wall Street’s latest digital asset adoption has not, however, translated to big price wins for the major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is down about 30% to roughly $87,000 since its high of $126,000 in early October. Ethereum is also down roughly 30% in the last three months to $2,919, and Solana is down roughly 43% to $123.07 during that same time period. It appears that the big banks are taking a long-term view on crypto and are not being scared off by this recent dip.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Courtesy of Advanced Micro Devices Over the next decade, you’ll surely want to own at least one artificial intelligence (AI) chip stock. You might assume that all you need is NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and nothing else. However, even though NVIDIA is the market’s darling, your best pick could actually be Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock. Even though it’s a giant company, Advanced Micro Devices is an underdog in some respects. Unlike NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices isn’t a member of the Magnificent Seven group of highly favored U.S. mega-cap stocks. This isn’t to suggest that buying and holding AMD stock for 10 years is a risk-free investment. Right now, we’ll tackle the red flags that must be acknowledged for long-term Advanced Micro Devices shareholders. In the end, though, you may be open to a buy-and-hold share position as Advanced Micro Devices is a chipmaking challenger with hyper-scaling potential. One possible deal-breaker for income investors is that AMD stock doesn’t pay a dividend. Consequently, you’ll need the share price to rise in order to make a profit. Meanwhile, value investors might take issue with Advanced Micro Devices’ valuation. Specifically, the company has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 113x. In addition, AMD stock is already up 135% over the past five years. Given the triple-digit P/E ratio and the stock’s price action, some value investors may not be willing to take a chance on Advanced Micro Devices. Those are valid objections, but to be fair, Advanced Micro Devices stock just pulled back nearly 20% from $167. Since the stock has a good track record of recovering from drawdowns, there appears to be a dip-buying opportunity here. Besides, if Advanced Micro Devices is a robust revenue and earnings grower, then the high P/E ratio don’t have to be a deal-breaker. With that in mind, let’s perform a thorough checkup on Advanced Micro Devices’ financial health. Advanced Micro Devices’ high P/E ratio and lack of a dividend are legitimate reasons to reduce your position size in AMD stock. Nevertheless, you’ll probably leave a lot of money on the table if you don’t own some shares of Advanced Micro Devices during the next 10 years. All in all, Advanced Micro Devices is an undeniable sales and income grower. To prove this point, we can observe the company’s results from the quarter ended September 27, 2025. Impressively, Advanced Micro Devices’ net revenue grew 35.6% year over year, from $6.819 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $9.246 billion. Nearly half of that revenue stemmed from Advanced Micro Devices’ Data Center segment; this suggests that the company continues to benefit from AI-associated sales. Turning to the bottom-line results, Advanced Micro Devices’ net income surged 61.2%, from $771 in the year-earlier quarter to $1.243 billion. Also during that time frame, the company’s cash and cash equivalents increased 27%, from $3.787 billion to $4.808 billion. So evidently, Advanced Micro Devices remains a cash-rich chipmaker that’s on a powerful growth trajectory. While U.S. chip sales are crucial to Advanced Micro Devices’ business model, it definitely appears that the company is making headway in China’s chip market. To be more specific, Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) is considering purchasing 40,000 to 50,000 of Advanced Micro Devices’ MI308 AI accelerators. This is important because investors need to think globally, not just locally, over the next 10 years. China is a major chip market, and Advanced Micro Devices has a long-term growth opportunity there. Advanced Micro Devices made a savvy move in designing its MI308 chips to be compatible with export restrictions. Furthermore, the company has secured export licenses for these chips and is prepared to pay a 15% fee to the U.S. on approved sales in China. Also, it’s a positive sign that Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su recently met with Chinese Commerce ​Minister Wang ‌Wentao in Beijing. They “exchanged views on the company’s business ⁠development in ​China and ​strengthening cooperation with China,” according to the ‍ministry. Sure, NVIDIA is also making headway into China’s chip market. At the same time, however, NVDA stock may have already priced in the company’s progress in this region. In contrast, Advanced Micro Devices’ growth story in China is still developing and the market needs time to recognize this. Give it a few years, and you should see AMD stock reflect strong chip sales in both the U.S. and China. In the final analysis, there’s no need to overload your portfolio with AMD stock. Just holding a moderately sized share position for 10 years will, most likely, put you in a profitable position without undue risk. While Advanced Micro Devices doesn’t pay a dividend and appears overvalued at first glance, I still encourage you to give the company a chance. If AI chip sales remain strong and Advanced Micro Devices keeps on growing its sales and profits, there’s an attractive reward-to-risk profile here for buy-and-hold investors.

Title: AI Gets the Blame for 55,000 Layoffs in 2025

Reading time 2 minutes Companies cut about 1.1 million jobs this year, the most since the covid-19 pandemic. However, the notion that those layoffs are occurring due to technological advancements, as if the majority of those roles are now filled by artificial intelligence, doesn’t quite align with the data. According to data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, about 55,000 layoffs were attributed directly to AIâless than 1% of all job losses. One industry where layoffs were common this year was tech, with many of the Big Tech firms cutting off large chunks of their workforce. Those often came with platitudes about streamlining and modernizing roles, with vague gestures toward the idea that AI will be stepping in. As Amazon started preparing to lay off workers in June, CEO Andy Jassy told employees that AI would mean the company would âneed fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” But in October, after cutting 14,000 people loose, Jassy told investors the decision was “not even really AI driven, not right now at least.” That’s not to say the introduction of AI hasn’t truly cost people jobs. Corporations like Salesforce, for instance, have gleefully sent humans home and started to make claims that as much as 50% of all work is now completed by AI. But if AI has had an effect on the workforce, it seems like it isn’t directly causing layoffs but is instead blocking new hires. Not only are people losing work, but companies also aren’t hiringâand entry-level roles in particular have been hard hit by the misguided idea that their roles can be filled by AI. Meanwhile, an MIT study published this summer found that 95% of organizations that have launched AI initiatives have seen zero financial return on their investment. The layoffs that have hit workers are real, of course. But AI may simply be a useful scapegoat for companies that want to appear like they are embracing automation and being forward-thinking when the reality is they either overhired in recent years while the economy was booming and now want to cut back as profit margins get thinner, or have been extremely hard hit by a turbulent economy plagued by the Trump administration’s tariff regime. The manufacturing industry, which should be booming with the massive data center construction projects cropping up across the country, has lost nearly 60,000 jobs since the start of the year. It’s not AI taking those roles. In the same Challenger, Gray and Christmas report that shows 55,000 jobs were lost directly to AI, more than twice as many were attributed to restructuring, about four times as many were blamed on market and economic conditions, and nearly six times as many were chalked up to cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency and the downstream impact of those decisions. It’s a good reminder that even when AI is attributed as the reason for a job cut, the decision was made by an executive who has done the math and determined that axing human labor in the name of “modernization” will likely boost the stock price.

Title: Microsoft bets on cloud and cross-platform future for Xbox while brushing off 30% profit margin rumors

Microsoft has denied recent reports claiming that it imposed a strict 30% profit margin on its Xbox gaming division. The company said it aims high, but didn’t provide an exact profit margin figure. Microsoft pushed back against the claims in a new CNBC interview, where the company discussed the challenges and rumors that arose over the past year, including numerous layoffs and project cancellations. Previously, a Bloomberg story in October reported that Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood has set a 30% profit goal as part of “accountability margins,” with Xbox in particular feeling the pressure. Many industry insiders whispered similar information, which was acknowledged as the primary driver of Microsoft’s cost-cutting measures, including scrapping various projects and reducing headcount. The 30% figure stood out because it’s well above typical profit margins in the gaming industry, which are reported to range from 17% to 22%. Xbox’s own margins were 12% in 2022, according to earlier documentation. Microsoft spoke to CNBC directly and said, “While the company does set ambitious goals, the reported 30% profit margin target was incorrect.” Xbox’s hurdles have been piling up, with over 9,000 employees affected across multiple rounds of layoffs. Numerous big-budget projects were axed in the wake of Microsoft’s layoffs, including The Initiative’s Perfect Dark Reboot, Rare’s long-in-development Everwild, and ZeniMax Online’s sci-fi MMO Project Blackbird. Furthermore, Xbox sales have taken a nosedive, with a whopping 70% drop in November, putting the company far behind Sony’s PlayStation 5 and Nintendo’s Switch 2 in hardware sales. Xbox also announced last week that it wouldn’t be implementing the Xbox Wrapped feature this year due to budget constraints. Reports claim that Xbox is shifting funds toward its 25th anniversary celebration in 2026. However, it still shows that the company is under financial pressure. Despite all these challenges and setbacks, Microsoft is still pursuing and pivoting towards cloud gaming and cross-platform gaming, Xbox Game Pass subscription, and is forgoing exclusivity to allow more players to join Xbox’s gaming endeavors, ranging from PCs, handhelds like the Rog Ally and Ally X, mobile devices, and even automobiles. As for Bloomberg, it’s not yet clear if the news outlet will retract its statement, update its report, or provide further information regarding the matter. Buy Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on Amazon CNBC

Title: Will Google Pass Nvidia in 2026 as the World’s Biggest Company?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. The stock market is quickly waking up to the fact that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the leading AI software company today. It has overtaken Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and is less than $200 billion away from overtaking Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the world’s second-largest company. Overtaking the AI hardware leader, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will take a bit more work, as it has a $755 billion lead over Google. Fortuitously for Google, that number is a drop in the bucket these days for Wall Street. There are still some bears who believe that Google will lose out in the end due to AI “replacing” the search engine business, but a lot is going wrong with that argument. Even Nvidia may get competition from Google, as the company has begun breaking into the AI hardware industry and is landing deals. Let’s take a look at whether or not all this momentum will translate into Alphabet becoming the biggest company in 2026. Google was supposed to “die” after Microsoft integrated its Bing search engine with ChatGPT. The issue was that people never ended up ditching Google. ChatGPT was never a 1:1 replacement for what Google offered, and AI could never provide the same reliability that a direct search can. Then, Alphaebt began to beat both OpenAI and Microsoft at their own game. Its initial AI “Bard” rollout was rushed and disappointing, but Google has made outstanding progress since. OpenAI is now in “code red” mode after the Gemini 3 Pro was released and promptly took over the leaderboards. If you look at the top 10 AI models on LLMArena, four are from Google. No other company matches that. OpenAI’s sole top 10 model is eighth, with xAI and Anthropic having two models each. If you move past text AI models, Google does even better. Its latest Nano Banana Pro image model puts OpenAI’s GPT image to shame. The company even leads when it comes to text-to-video models. Alphabet is doing all that while keeping costs under control. It hasn’t spent excessively on AI, and cash on the balance sheet increased from $19.96 billion in Q3 2024 to $23.09 billion in Q3 2025. AI rivals like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have gone into net debt. If Google’s rivals somehow find their bearings and win the AI race, the core search engine business, the cloud business, and other businesses like YouTube will remain insulated. As for search, consumers have shown no desire to stick with an alternative. This is mainly because Google owns the search bar and provides all they need. Going to another AI website, searching, and waiting for it to provide an answer is an extra level of inconvenience that very few people are willing to put up with. In contrast, you can just use your search bar. Google itself will give you an AI answer, with all the regular results below it. Software isn’t Alphabet’s only strong suit. Google has aggressively expanded into custom silicon with its TPUs and Axion CPUs. It could shatter Nvidia’s near-monopoly if the company can execute well, since the hardware is much cheaper and more energy-efficient. Meta is in discussions with Google to buy TPUs worth “billions of dollars,” with AI company Anthropic already buying 1 million of them. This is money that would have otherwise gone into Nvidia’s coffers instead. The threat Nvidia faces from Google is very underestimated today. However, this could just be a repeat of how Google’s AI was shrugged off, only to end up dominating. I do believe Alphabet is set to become the world’s largest company, either in 2026 or sometime in this decade. EPS is expected to jump from an estimated $10.56 in 2025 to over $26 in 2031. Some analysts expect EPS to be over $30.7 by then. Revenue is also expected to keep growing at a very healthy clip and possibly double from 2025 to 2030. Nvidia will be growing at an even faster clip, but all its eggs are in one basket. That basket is being threatened by Google. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: The 120 Most Powerful Executives in Entertainment, Ranked

Full Content:
In business, the power of individual leaders is an inherently hard thing to measure. It’s subjective, and it fluctuates on any given day, just like the strength of an electrical current goes up and down depending on environmental conditions. To commemorate Variety’s 120th anniversary year, we gave ourselves a tough assignment. We wanted to take a snapshot of leadership and muscle in the entertainment industry at this fraught moment of turmoil and transition for Hollywood. After months of internal debate, months of arguing over draft lists and a last push of double-checking titles and name spellings, here we finally arrive at the end result: The Variety 120 list of the most powerful executives in entertainment. Notice the emphasis on executives. We realized early on that we needed strict guidelines for who to include and who not to include. The Variety 120 is a survey of executive leadership at the industry’s biggest and most influential companies. That includes some companies that are far removed from Hollywood geographically but still have influence in the global business of entertainment, which we define here as film, TV, music and gaming. We intentionally did not include actors, writers, directors, producers, multihyphenates, lawyers, talent agents or managers, simply to make the ranking process more manageable. We also kept our lens focused on traditional entertainment, thus this list does not include leaders from sports or news. When you get down to it, 120 isn’t that many slots to cover a truly global business. So we lean toward the C-suite – the senior managers who are responsible for driving their companies forward and delivering the bottom line. Also, notice the emphasis on big. This list leans toward the biggest studios, labels, streamers and game publishers who dominate mass media production and distribution. We considered a company’s market share and market cap in determining this ranking. A person’s career achievements and overall industry stature were also a factor for inclusion. We also considered things that can’t be tallied with a calculator. In many of the entries, you’ll read our assessment that the individual has strong ties or deep connections to the creative community, or the investment community, or that he or she commands great respect among colleagues. It’s a relationship business, after all. Executive careers rise and fall on the strength of reputations. All kidding aside, it really is like high school with money and stock options. Variety journalists write every day (every hour) about how dramatically our industry is being transformed by the streaming revolution, by the growth of the global demand for content and by the rise of digital-native creators who would scoff “TLDR” at the idea of getting notes from a creative executive. But in reality, if you want to break a new artist, launch a TV show, open a movie or orchestrate a blockbuster video game release – most roads to achieving a bona fide hit still run through the companies and the leaders highlighted here. Listen to “Daily Variety” podcast: Showbiz news and analysis tailored for industry insiders. Spoiler alert: Our selection for the last slot on this list, No. 120, was carefully considered. The person is the leader of Indonesia’s largest media conglomerate. Indonesia is one of the world’s fast-rising entertainment hubs. We noticed that from our internet traffic and by the growing number of markets and festivals that we cover in the region. We made this choice to bookend the list with a signpost of the future and an example of the reach and influence of movies, TV, music and games. From our very first issue, published Dec. 16, 1905, much of Variety’s focus has been on the people who work behind the scenes to make things happen for those who take the stage. We hope this list can be a scorecard for readers who, like the staff of Variety, are eager to see what comes next for our fascinating industry in 2026 and beyond. Profiles written by Jem Aswad, Matt Donnelly, Steven J. Horowitz, Angelique Jackson, Elsa Keslassy, Brent Lang, Cynthia Littleton, Jennifer Maas, Naman Ramachandran, Rebecca Rubin, Michael Schneider, Todd Spangler, Brian Steinberg and Nick Vivarelli. Title: Co-CEO, Netflix Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Sarandos got his start in the entertainment biz working at a video-rental store as a teen. He’s now one of the most powerful content executives in Hollywood, rubbing elbows with celebs, showrunners, directors and other creatives who make content (or want to) for Netflix’s 300 million-plus subscribers worldwide. He’s overseen all content operations at the company since 2000, when it was still a DVD-by-mail outfit, and has had his hand on the steering wheel throughout its monumental rise. Sarandos led Netflix’s move into original content starting with the 2013 launch of “House of Cards.” He has famously called the moviegoing experience “outdated,” irking not just theater owners but filmmakers. In a reflection of Netflix’s clout, Sarandos has made a serious bid to acquire the Warner Bros. studios and HBO Max. Even if Netflix doesn’t win, Sarandos is showing that the company is definitely playing in the big leagues. Title: Chairman, NBCUniversal Entertainment Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: The more that Comcast pushes onto Langley’s plate, the more she rises to the challenge. As NBCUniversal and other top traditional media companies focus on the power of big events to draw large audiences, Langley must translate her success with content franchises into devising spectacles that bring people to screens all at the same time. Look for NBCU to celebrate more anniversaries like the 50th anniversary of “Saturday Night Live” and NBC’s centennial in the months to come. She must also help stock the pipeline with new content favorites that draw viewers to the Peacock streaming service as well as traditional TV. After a sweeping reorganization of NBCUniversal in 2024, Langley controls greenlights across the entire enterprise, overseeing programming, marketing, distribution, acquisitions and operations for the film and TV studios, the linear network, Peacock and Bravo. Her trademark poise served her well through the M&A noise of 2025, delivering consistent support for creatives. Langley’s beloved film studio Universal Pictures, her training ground, look to blow the doors off of 2026 with releases from Christopher Nolan and Steven Spielberg, as well as animated sequels in the “Minions” and “Super Mario Bros.” franchises. Title: Chairman and CEO, Paramount Skydance Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Ellison has a network of influential friends and family, starting with his ultra-wealthy dad, Oracle mogul Larry Ellison. After a career as a film producer with hits that included Tom Cruise’s “Top Gun: Maverick,” Ellison donned the mantle of media mogul. He led Skydance Media’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Global, bankrolled by his father and RedBird Capital Partners — a deal that met with the approval of Donald Trump and his administration. After installing a mostly new management team, Ellison’s early moves at the new Paramount Skydance have included inking a rich deal for UFC rights and the acquisition of Bari Weiss’s The Free Press (with Weiss installed as editor-in-chief of CBS News). Ellison is now looking consolidate more power in Hollywood: He’s in the thick of a public brawl with Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety, pitting him against Netflix. The sale process is turning in to a referendum on the future of Hollywood. Title: CEO, YouTube Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Mohan is a Silicon Valley exec with a chill vibe — who runs a media business estimated to rival Disney by revenue, as YouTube reinforces its pole position as the most-streamed service on TVs in the U.S. That stunning stat surely helped YouTube land the TV rights deal that shocked Hollywood: The annual Oscars kudocast will move to YouTube starting in 2029 with the 101st Academy Awards ceremony. It’s been a busy few years on the job for Mohan, who assumed the chief exec role in 2023 after serving as YouTube’s chief product officer. He joined Google with its acquisition of DoubleClick in 2007. In addition to overseeing YouTube’s significant core ads business, Mohan has been driving growth of the platform’s subscriptions businesses, including YouTube TV. With more than 10 million pay-TV subscribers, YouTube was in a position to flex its market power in programming renewals in 2025 — and its tough negotiating tactics led to blackouts of Disney and Univision nets before the parties reached deals. Mohan is now setting YouTube’s AI agenda, balancing concerns of Hollywood players with the rollout of powerful new content tools for its millions of creators. Title: Co-Chairman, Disney Entertainment Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: One of the most powerful and well-regarded execs in TV, Walden leads Disney’s portfolio of entertainment media, news and content businesses worldwide, and has shared oversight of Disney+ and Hulu with Alan Bergman. Under her leadership, ABC has been the No. 1 entertainment network for four straight seasons and ABC News has topped its rivals — impressive achievements even as linear TV continues to decline. Over the years, Walden has had indisputable success in television, overseeing such hits as “24,” “Glee,” “Modern Family,” “Homeland,” “This Is Us” and more recently, “Abbott Elementary,” “High Potential,” “Paradise,” “Only Murders in the Building,” “The Kardashians” and more. Before joining Disney, she rose through the ranks at the Fox studio and network. Now she’s on the short list to succeed Bob Iger at the helm of Disney next year. This fall, Walden faced a test with ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel amid a right-wing backlash over his comments about Charlie Kirk’s murder. After a PR storm, she brought Kimmel back and got two big affiliate groups to resume airing his show. She was also in the thick of Disney’s two-week battle with YouTube in November over a carriage agreement. Title: CEO, Disney Held job since: 2022 (was CEO from 2005-20) Sources of power: Iger is on his second farewell tour as leader of the Magic Kingdom, with the 74-year-old executive’s contract expiring in December 2026 — and Disney’s board poised to name a successor early next year. But even as a lame-duck CEO, Iger remains a powerful force in media and entertainment. Following Iger’s return as chief exec in late 2022 in the wake of Disney’s first try at finding an Iger successor did not take. Since his return, Iger has reinvigorated Disney’s movie studios and overseen the theme park and cruise biz’s recovery from the COVID crash. Iger has moved to combine Disney+ and Hulu (after closing the buyout of Comcast’s Hulu stake) into a supercharged unified streamer while finally launching a streaming-only version of ESPN. The stock hasn’t recovered from its streaming-bubble highs, but Iger has proven a deft manager of the global entertainment conglomerate’s many moving pieces. Even as he says goodbye — after postponing his retirement five times! — Iger will have a part in the selection of the next CEO. Title: Chairman and CEO, Comcast Corp. Held job since: Chairman, 2004; CEO, 2002 Sources of power: An unassuming media executive in an industry filled with CEOs willing to pitch, promote and propagandize, Roberts presides over one of the largest distributorships of video in the nation, as well as the NBCUniversal entertainment empire. He has quietly worked to keep the company current by investing in sports rights as well as overseas assets like Sky. Roberts must now steer the company around new hurdles, including cord cutting and the rise of streaming video. Because nothing stays the same in pay TV for long. With the planned Versant Media spinoff expected to be completed early next year, Comcast will soon part with the basic cable networks that were so central to its purchase of NBCUniversal from General Electric back in 2011. Title: Chairman and CEO, Universal Music Group Held job since: 2010 Sources of power: Grainge joined Universal in 1986 at leader of its Polydor publishing division and rose through the ranks during periods of galvanizing change in the industry, assuming the helm in 2010 just as streaming was beginning to take hold. In the years since he has presided over UMG’s expansion into the world’s largest music company — with artists ranging from the Beatles and Taylor Swift to the Weeknd and “KPop Demon Hunters” — its public listing in 2021, the expansion of its publishing and merchandise divisions, and the rise and plateau of streaming growth. Most recently, UMG has taken a leadership position in steering the industry through the challenges of AI (striking deals with and/or lawsuits against major AI companies — or both, as with Suno) and its next areas of growth, including initiatives to increasingly monetize “superfans.” There are certainly challenges: UMG’s $775 million acquisition of the artist-services company Downtown is under fierce scrutiny from the EU, and it was actually sued for defamation by Drake, one of its biggest artists, in bizarre collateral damage from that artist’s feud with fellow UMG artist Kendrick Lamar. But in the third quarter of 2025, Universal held nearly 36% U.S. market share — and that was before the release of Taylor Swift’s “Life of a Showgirl,” which sold a record-breaking 2.7 million copies on its first day. Title: CEO, Warner Bros. Discovery Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: David Zaslav has been on a hire-wire act of debt, restructuring and outrunning the marketplace to prove the merger thesis that brought WarnerMedia and Discovery together in April 2022. But time ran out. David Ellison’s aggressive overtures forced his hand to initiate a sale process for all or part of the Warner Bros. Discovery (depending on who’s buying). For the foreseeable future, Zaslav still holds the keys in Burbank and Hudson Yards – and he’s demonstrating that in rebuffing Paramount’s offers more than half a dozen times in favor of Netflix’s $83 billion offer. Leading WBD for the past three years has been Zaslav’s highest profile job in Hollywood – and he’s become a lightning rod in the creative community at a time of disruption. Zaslav got his start in the go-go early days of cable in the 1980s with a long tenure at NBC where he helped launch CNBC and MSNBC. He gained prominence as a CEO – and for his huge paychecks — after he took the reins of Discovery Communications in late 2006. Title: Senior VP of Services, Apple Held job since: 2011 Sources of power: Cue is the ultimate Apple insider. He has long steered its expansion on the software and services side of the ledger for the company that has transformed the world with its hardware. He also clearly has the trust of CEO Tim Cook to set the agenda for Apple in Hollywood. Cue has embraced a build-not-buy strategy as Apple has revved up the Apple TV content business with big-budget series, sports rights, documentaries and children’s programs. The success of Apple’s first mega-budget film production, “F1: The Movie,” reflected well on Cue’s steady-hand stewardship. And his ambition was on display when he told Variety during a cover story interview that he really wanted “F1” to reach moviegoers in a profound way. “I hope that when most people go see the movie, they walk out wanting to be a race car driver,” he told Variety in April 2025. Title: Chief Content Officer, Netflix Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Nearly three years into her gig as chief content officer at Netflix and with almost a decade at the streamer under her belt, Bajaria oversees some of the biggest and boldest TV shows of our time, including “Stranger Things,” “Squid Game,” “Wednesday,” “Bridgerton,” “Heeramandi” and “Lupin,” and Oscar-winning films like “All Quiet on the Western Front” and “Guillermo Del Toro’s Pinocchio.” And her power in Hollywood is poised to get even bigger if Netflix succeeds in taking over Warner Bros. Discovery. For now, Bajaria’s focus is on continuing to grow Netflix’s local-programming offerings throughout the globe and pushing the streamer further into live events and sports. Before joining Netflix, Bela was president of Universal Television. Title: Co-Chairman, Disney Entertainment Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Bergman is the well-respected leader in charge of the Mouse House’s film studios, which feed into both theatrical and streaming pipelines. He’s managing not just release windows and production budgets, but also egos. On his watch, Disney has produced several billion-dollar-plus hits, including “Inside Out 2,” “Deadpool & Wolverine,” “Moana 2” and the live-action “Lilo & Stitch,” with “Zootopia 2” on track to be another big winner. A nearly three-decade company veteran, he became chairman of Walt Disney Studios in 2021. He was elevated to his current role in 2023, in which capacity he has shared oversight (alongside Dana Walden) of Disney’s direct-to-consumer, technology and ad sales groups, as well as international content and operations. Title: Head of Amazon MGM Studios and Amazon Prime Video Held job since: 2020 Sources of power: Mike Hopkins shepherded some big changes at Amazon’s on-screen entertainment division this year with the exits of both Jennifer Salke and Vernon Sanders from the studio business, and the entrance of longtime Netflix TV exec Peter Friedlander. Building on his background in distribution and sales from his time as CEO at Hulu and president of Fox networks, Hopkins continues to push Amazon into TV ad sales through its Amazon Ads infrastructure to growing success. Under Hopkins, Prime Video currently offers more than 100 add-on subscription options in the U.S., including Warner Bros. Discovery’s HBO Max, Paramount+, Sony’s Crunchyroll and Amazon-owned MGM+. Amazon’s reach has made the channels offering a big driver of subscription for these media partners. Title: President and CEO, Live Nation Held job since: 2005 Sources of power: A master of vertical integration, Rapino has kept Live Nation and Ticketmaster to one record-breaking year after another even as the post-pandemic boom in concertgoing has leveled off. So far in 2025, Live Nation is on pace to have its biggest year yet, with overall revenue for the first nine months hitting $18.89 billion, up eight percent compared to last year’s $17.5 billion. Much of the company’s growth can be attributed to the demand for live entertainment in international markets, where fan count is projected to surpass the United States for the first time. Chalk that up to major tours that saw artists like Kendrick Lamar and Beyoncé traipsing the globe, yet it’s also the company’s ongoing ventures into management, venue ownership and other related areas of the business. Title: Chairman and CEO, HBO and Max Content Held job since: August 2020 Sources of power: Casey Bloys likes awards, and for good reason: HBO/HBO Max gets a lot of them. In 2025, the combined outlets landed 30 Emmys — tying Netflix for the most — thanks to the strength of series like “The Pitt” (outstanding drama series), “The Penguin,” “Hacks,” “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” and more. His current roster also includes smashes like “House of the Dragon,” “The White Lotus,” “The Last of Us” and “Euphoria” — which recently gave him four current original series with cross-platform audiences averaging more than 15 million viewers per episode – a first for the pay cabler. Other titles that have driven the TV conversation under his watch have included “Succession,” “Barry,” “The Rehearsal,” the “True Detective” franchise, “And Just Like That” and “Peacemaker”; and earlier, “Veep,” “Girls,” “Silicon Valley,” “Watchmen,” “Westworld,” “Big Little Lies” and “Chernobyl.” Bloys first took over HBO series, late night and specials as president in February 2016; he joined the network in 2004 as director of development at HBO Independent Productions. Title: Chairman, FX Networks Held job since: 2019 Sources of power: An astute observer of the TV landscape and respected creative leader, Landgraf has made boundary-pushing television a hallmark of FX ever since he joined in 2004. Under Landgraf, FX has produced solid ratings and acclaim with bold (some might say risky) bets such as “Shōgun” — winner of 18 Emmy awards, a one-year record for a single series — as well as series like “The Bear,” “Fargo,” “Alien: Earth,” long-running fan-favorite “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” and Ryan Murphy’s “American Horror Story” franchise. After Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox, Landgraf aligned with the Mouse House’s streaming strategy to make Hulu the primary streaming outlet for FX, which has let him continue to take big swings on standout content. Title: Co-CEO, Netflix Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Peters may not have the name recognition of his co-CEO partner Ted Sarandos, but the duo are on equal footing in running the streaming giant. Peters, who joined Netflix in 2008, was previously chief product officer and spent several years as general manager of Netflix Japan. While Sarandos handles the content side, Peters focuses on technology, product development, pricing and partnerships. His purview also includes the still-nascent games initiative and the growing ad-supported business. Peters knows the Netflix culture inside and out, and he’s credited with building the company’s talent organization and recently overseeing a revision to its famed “Culture Memo.” Peters will be an integral part of any integration of Warner Bros. and HBO into Netflix, should the acquisition agreement come to pass. Title: President, Marvel Studios; Chief Creative Officer, Marvel Held job since: 2010 / 2019 Sources of power: After a stretch of ho-hum box office performers in recent years, Marvel Studios aims to reclaim its status as the premiere superhero studio in 2026 with “Avengers: Doomsday.” The blockbuster-to-be features the return of “Endgame” directors Anthony and Joe Russo, the revival of Chris Evans’ Steve Rogers, and recasting Robert Downey Jr. as the villainous Doctor Doom, plus finally introducing the X-Men into the MCU. In a rare interview with reporters over the summer, Feige declared that well-documented problems Marvel’s been facing stem from an overabundance of supply, not a sudden drop in demand. As such, Marvel’s output for 2026 will be drastically decreased, with just three movies launching in theaters: “Spider-Man: Brand New Day,” the studio’s co-production with Sony Pictures; a special re-release of “Avengers: Endgame” and “Doomsday.” Title: President and CEO, Sony Pictures Entertainment Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Ravi Ahuja was one half of the most orderly transition atop a Hollywood studio in recent memory. He took the CEO reins from Tony Vinciquerra last January, but the plan was set in motion when Ahuja was recruited to Sony to head TV operations, after a he had a brief run as president of business operations and chief financial officer of Walt Disney Television. Ahuja’s first big test at Sony was steering the “Jeopardy” host transition, which took two tries to get right, but America’s favorite quiz show endured. Now he’s got a long runway to lead the studio into its second century (Columbia Pictures marked its centennial in 2024) and its endowed with a library of more than 3,500 films and more than 35,000 episodes in an IP-hungry marketplace. Title: President, Paramount Skydance Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: • He’s the key operating executive overseeing the newly merged Paramount Skydance.• He’s a media veteran after climbing the ranks at NBCUniversal, Comcast and Fox. Shell has rebounded at the enlarged Paramount Skydance after exiting NBCUniversal in 2023 after admitting to having had an inappropriate relationship with an NBCUniversal employee. He’s now back in new role as David Ellison’s right-hand man given his depth of experience. At Paramount Skydance, he’s overseeing day-to-day operations, a task that has included a wave of mass layoffs conducted three months after the Paramount Global takeover closed. Shell isn’t just trying to slash costs: He and Ellison envision a new path forward for Paramount’s TV business, hoping to reinvent brands like CBS News, MTV and Comedy Central for a streaming-centric world, while pumping more content into Paramount+. If his boss is successful in landing Warner Bros. Discovery, Shell will have an even bigger collection of media businesses under his oversight. Title: Executive Chairman and CEO of Fox Corp., Chairman of News Corp. Held job since: 2019 Sources of power: Under Murdoch’s aegis, Fox Corp. proven surprisingly robust and resilient. After the company sold off much of its studio and cable assets to Disney in 2019, conventional wisdom held that Fox would be a small but feisty element in the media ecosystem, but the company’s focus on news, sports and other types of must-watch-as-it-happens content has boosted viewership and revenue. There are challenges ahead, especially as the NFL moves closer to renegotiating its current media contracts, but Fox has thrived by taking measured steps into streaming and bigger steps to lock in live viewership. Title: President and CEO, Sony Group Corporation Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Hiroki Totoki took over as Sony’s CEO in April 2025 as the company’s center of gravity shifted decisively toward entertainment. In the run-up to the transition, he was closely involved in steering Sony’s entertainment businesses toward greater IP coordination across Pictures, Music and PlayStation, reinforcing a strategy built on franchises that can move across formats and markets. That approach aligns with Sony’s long-standing focus on Kando — emotional impact delivered at scale — and has shown up in properties ranging from anime juggernaut “Demon Slayer” to cross-media adaptations like “The Last of Us.” Totoki also took direct oversight of Sony Interactive Entertainment during a leadership transition, underlining his role as the executive trusted with execution when the stakes are high. As CEO, he now controls a company where games, music, film and anime drive strategy — alongside the hardware that carries them. Title: Co-Chair and CEO, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Pamela Abdy and Michael De Luca proved naysayers wrong this year after a rough 2024 and early 2025. They turned things around the old-fashioned way – by banking on bold directors and new ideas during a time where reboots and sequels have reigned supreme. Movies of all shapes and sizes, from Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners,” Zach Cregger’s “Weapons” and Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” scored with audiences. It’s an ethos that De Luca has embraced throughout his career, which took off when he was named production chief at New Line Cinema at the age of 27. He championed films such as “Seven,” “Boogie Nights,” “Friday” and helped to launch the careers of David Fincher and Anderson. The pair headed MGM prior to its sale to Amazon, which was around the time that Warner Bros. was in the market for new film leadership. Abdy and De Luca got to work quickly and took big swings while brokering deals with directors and stars like Ryan Coogler, Emerald Fennell, Zach Cregger and Tom Cruise. The 2025 slate backs up the pair’s promise to use WB’s considerable resources to make the studio an attractive place to work for “filmmakers with singular visions,” as they wrote in a memo to staff in October after renewing their contracts. Title: Chairman and CEO, Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group Held job since: 2015 Sources of power: Rothman is the definition of a certain kind of hard-driving studio executive of yore but this year he proved he can innovate with original concepts and service big IP at the same time. He bet on Keke Palmer, SZA and Issa Rae with the commercial and critical hit “One of Them Days,” relaunched Danny Boyle’s “28 Days Later” franchise with a sequel to follow immediately in ’26 and captured the zeitgeist with “KPop Demon Hunters” (though that film released via Sony’s pay-one partner Netflix). As always with Rothman, the man guaranteed to deliver an expletive-laden sound bite at CinemaCon, it’s about next year’s slate. 2026 will bring “Spider-Man: Brand New Day,” and the innovative four-part biopic release “The Beatles” from filmmaker Sam Mendes. Title: Chairman, Netflix Film Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: After building a reputation on spinning popular film franchises out of existing IP (“The Lego Movie” franchise, Stephen King’s “It” and “Sherlock Holmes”), in 2024, film producer Dan Lin pivoted from film producer to studio head by taking on the top film job at Netflix. Just two years prior, Lin had been in negotiations to become head of DC Studios but decided to stick to his own shingle, Rideback, but the Netflix offer proved to be the right kind of challenge. Since joining the streamer, Lin has enforced a strategy of making one major tentpole film each quarter — upcoming offerings include “The Rip,” from Ben Affleck and Matt Damon; “Apex” with Charlize Theron; and “Here Comes the Flood,” with Denzel Washingont, Daisy Edgar-Jones and Robert Pattionson. Among Lin’s biggest wins so far was overseeing the final cut of “K-Pop Demon Hunters,” which has become Netflix’s biggest film ever and greenlighting an ambitious slate of films, including Greta Gerwig’s “Narnia,” which will also play an exclusive engagement at Imax theaters worldwide. Titles: Co-Head, Worldwide Video, Apple Held job since: 2017 Sources of power: Erlicht and Van Amburg long ago learned how to expand their effectiveness through an air-tight partnership. They worked together for 15 years as programming executives at Sony Pictures Television and its predecessors before being recruited in 2017 by Apple services boss Eddy Cue to drive the company’s leap into original content production and commissioning what was born in November 2019 as Apple TV+ (in October, they nixed the + sign with a rebrand as Apple TV). The two have built the operation in the fishbowl of being a high-profile startup effort within a corporate giant of immense influence and a $4 trillion market cap. Erlicht and Van Amburg have endured waves of rumored shakeups and scrutiny of their creative strategies. This summer “F1: The Movie” was the kind of popcorn vehicle at the global box office that made the parent company proud. It also dovetailed nicely with Apple TV’s five-year deal unveiled in October that will bring F1 racing rights to its platform in the U.S. starting in 2026. Title: Co-Chair, Paramount Pictures and Chair, Paramount Television Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Dana Goldberg has a bigger picture to look at these days now that her longtime home Skydance is also home to all of Paramount’s IP. Partnered with Josh Greenstein on the film front and flying solo at the top of TV, Goldberg is plotting out long-term strategy for both divisions under David Ellison’s new regime. As of this year, Goldberg now oversees production, marketing, distribution and strategic planning, and has added Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon Films and Paramount Television Studios to her purview. Goldberg joined Skydance in 2010 as president of production and helped found Skydance Television in 2013. Most recently, Goldberg was chief creative officer of Skydance overseeing several entries in the “Mission: Impossible” film franchise, as well as hit series like “Reacher” and “Jack Ryan.” Before joining Skydance, Goldberg was head of production at Village Roadshow Pictures. Title: Co-Chair of Paramount Pictures and Vice Chair of Platforms, Paramount Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: This year, Josh Greenstein left Sony Pictures after a decade to head up the film division at the newly merged Skydance-Paramount alongside Dana Goldberg, and advise on Paramount’s new cross-platform strategy across film and TV. For the previous 10 years, Greenstein was at the top of Sony’s Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, Screen Gems, Stage 6 Films, AFFIRM Films, and Sony Pictures Animation, overseeing films including the “Spider-Man” and “Spiderverse” franchises, “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” “James Bond” and Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women.” During Greenstein’s tenure, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” became Sony’s highest-grossing film of all time, earning $1.91 billion worldwide at the box office and “Into the Spider-Verse” won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Prior to joining Sony, he was head of marketing at Paramount Pictures, overseeing franchises including “Transformers,” “Star Trek,” “Jackass” and “Scary Movie.” Title: Co-chairman and CEO, DC Studios Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: James Gunn and Peter Safran, the new guardians of DC Studios, were hired to create a cohesive, long-term strategy for the Warner Bros.-owned comic book empire. Gunn, the operation’s creative mind, took those efforts into his own hands with last summer’s hit “Superman,” which had epic responsibility of relaunching DC Universe. (The studio’s last iteration of superhero movies imploded with the unfortunate losing-streak of “The Flash,” “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” “Shazam: Fury of the Gods” and “Blue Beetle.”) Gunn will return to the director’s chair for what he describes as the “next installment in the Super-Family,” but he’s passed off the reins for “Supergirl” and “Clayface,” two spinoffs set in 2026 that’ll be a bigger test of DC’s popularity. Both focus on comic book characters that don’t enjoy the benefit of being household names. Safran, a business-minded executive and a former talent manager with Brillstein-Grey, has proven a flair for knowing the projects that’ll speak to audiences. He’s a lead producer on the “Conjuring” universe, which is the highest-grossing horror franchise with more than $2 billion across nine films. Title: CEO, Lionsgate Held job since: 2000 Sources of power: Lionsgate was a much smaller operation when Feltheimer took over the the turn of the 2000s after nine years at Sony’s Columbia TriStar TV Group. The Canadian-born studio emerged as a global contender on Feltheimer’s watch with hits such as the “Twilight” and “The Hunger Games” film series. The studio rode the pre-Peak TV wave of scripted expansion with such distinctive hits as “Mad Men,” “Weeds” and more recently “Ghosts,” “Yellowjackets” and “The Studio.” But like every other studio, Lionsgate’s traditional profit engines are under new pressures that will challenge the leadership of a long-serving CEO. Title: CEO, Sony Music Entertainment/Chairman, Sony Music Group Held job since: 2017/2019 Sources of power: Stringer has spent his tenure at Sony Music building out the various arms of the operation, from buying indie companies AWAL and Orchard to acquiring catalogs from Queen and Pink Floyd, for a reported $1.27 billion and $400 million, respectively. This year, Sony Music Entertainment saw significant boosts across the board as records including Tyler, the Creator’s “Don’t Tap the Glass” and Bad Bunny’s “DeBÍ TiRAR Más FOToS” became global hits, boosting total profit from recorded music and publishing to $2.89 billion in Q3 — up 13.3 percent year over year. Over the first three quarters of 2025, SME earned a 26.65 percent market share, per Billboard — ahead of Warner Music Group and indies, and only second to Universal Music Group. And in an industry where AI has become a hotbed for controversy, Stringer has helped broker a landmark deal with Spotify to develop AI tools intended to aid artists. Title: Chairman, Television Studios, NBC Entertainment and Peacock Scripted Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Pearlena Igbokwe has arguably one of the most compelling stories of any TV executive out there: Having emigrated from Nigeria at age 6, Igbokwe was raised on some the greatest U.S. shows of the 1970s and 1980s. That inspired her to pursue a job in TV, which led her to early positions at NBC and HBO, before starting a 20-year tenure at Showtime, where she developed “Dexter,” “Nurse Jackie” and “Masters of Sex,” among other shows. In 2012, she returned to NBC, and quickly saw her star rise as she worked in drama on series such as “The Blacklist” and “This Is Us.” Moving to Universal TV as president, she expanded the Dick Wolf empire (which now includes the “Law & Order,” “Chicago” and “FBI” franchises) and built a thriving business as a supplier to outlets like Netflix and HBO. Taking over Universal Studio Group in 2020, Igbokwe now oversees teams that handle staples like NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” and “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” “America’s Got Talent” as well as HBO Max’s “Hacks,” Netflix’s “A Man on the Inside” and all those Wolf shows. And the talent in her company’s purview include Mike Schur, Tina Fey, Jordan Peele, Darren Star, Nahnatchka Khan, Seth MacFarlane, Julie Plec, Amy Poehler, Lorne Michaels and others. Title: Chairman and CEO, Warner Bros. Television Group and US Networks Held job since: 2021 / 2025 Sources of power: Channing Dungey has made history several times in her career, including as the first Black executive to lead a major broadcast network, and the first woman and first Black executive to run Warner Bros. TV Group. Her oversight include Warner Bros. TV, Warner Bros. Unscripted TV (including Warner Horizon, Shed Media and Telepictures) and animated producers Warner Bros. Animation, Cartoon Network Studios and Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe. On her watch, Warner Bros. TV Group has enjoyed a string of recent successes in network, cable, streaming and syndication including “The Pitt,” “Abbott Elementary,” “Ted Lasso,” “The Bachelor” franchise, “The Penguin,” “Shrinking,” “The Voice,” “Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage,” “Running Point,” “The Jennifer Hudson Show,” “You” and more. Before Warner Bros. and Discovery plan their split — which would move the U.S. networks to a separate company — Dungey has also spent part of the past year evolving the conglom’s linear TV business with channels like Discovery, HGTV, Food, Cartoon Network, TLC, Adult Swim, TBS, TNT, TCM and others. Dungey is a well-liked, celebrated exec who at ABC Entertainment built hits like “The Good Doctor” and the return of “American Idol,” and also made a swift change to “Roseanne” when its star made offensive remarks on social media. She also developed signature shows like “Scandal” and “Once Upon a Time” and helped keep long-running series like “Grey’s Anatomy” as juggernauts. She was also named one of Variety’s Power of Women honorees in 2021. Title: President of Direct-to-Consumer, Disney Entertainment Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Joe Earley has the marketing sensibilities required to oversee the operations and growth strategies for two of the most important assets of the future for Disney – streamers Disney+ and Hulu. His experience as a producer with Gail Berman at Jackal Group after he left Fox will also serve him well in a job that requires juggling a broad portfolio – from Hulu’s edgy limited series to Disney-branded shows for Disney+. Title: Chair of Direct to Consumer, Paramount Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: While now a key member of David Ellison’s leadership team at the Skydance-owned Paramount, Cindy Holland is still best known for setting Netflix up to be the powerhouse TV industry player it is today. Holland spent a total of 18 years with the streamer, nine of which she served as head of original content, where she established the programming strategy with early streaming hits including “House of Cards,” “Orange is the New Black” and “Stranger Things.” Earlier this year, Holland stepped away from her role as CEO at indie studio Sister to join Ellison’s exec ranks as the lieutenant in charge of revamping Paramount’s streaming offering as the company enters its new era. Title: CEO, Illumination Entertainment Held job since: 2007 Sources of power: Chris Meledandri founded Illumination in 2007 after a stint running animation at Fox. He quickly established the company, which was backed by Universal, as one of the most successful producers of family fare in Hollywood. It all kicked off with 2010’s “Despicable Me,” the story of a reformed supervillain named Gru that has spawned four films and three spinoffs featuring the Minions. But Illumination didn’t stop there, producing hits such as “The Grinch,” “Sing” and “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.” What makes the company’s output particularly appealing is that its movies cost between $70 million to $100 million to produce, far less than the $200 million that Disney typically spends. Next up, Illumination will release “The Super Mario Galaxy Movie” and “Minions 3,” both of which are expected to be among 2026’s biggest box office players. Title: President, Disney Television Group Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Erwich oversees a broad menu of programs and brands in his role leading ABC Entertainment, Hulu Originals, Freeform, Disney Channel and other kidvid platforms. He’s worked as a program buyer and seller, giving him the perspective and connections to juggle a high volume of development and production. Erwich has been key to Disney’s strategy of windowing “Only Murders in the Building,” “Paradise” and other Hulu originals on ABC. “There’s the broadcast experience and the kind of shows that thrive there, but now there’s another window — and a very important and vibrant one for those shows — on Hulu,” Erwich told Variety in April. Title: Chair of TV Media, Paramount Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: George Cheeks is one of the few Paramount Global senior employees who came out of the Skydance acquisition with a prime spot at the top under David Ellison. Following a brief tenure as co-CEO of Paramount Global upon the exit of Bob Bakish, while also still acting as president and CEO of CBS. Now, Cheeks’ brands include CBS Television Network, CBS News and Stations, CBS Sports, CBS Studios, BET Studios, Nickelodeon TV Studios, See It Now Studios, MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and BET. Since Cheeks took over at CBS, the network, has launched hits including “Tracker,” “Fire Country,” “Ghosts” and “Matlock.” Cheeks came over to CBS in 2020 after a stint as co-chairman of NBC Entertainment. Title: Head of Theatrical and Streaming Films, Amazon MGM Studios Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: The longtime Warner Bros. Pictures executive came to Amazon MGM following the ecommerce giant’s purchase of the studio that Variety famously dubbed “the Lion.” Valenti’s arrival was seen as sign that the enlarged studio operation was getting serious about revving up a slate of commercial theatrical films. Valenti’s experience ranges from Harry Potter franchise films to Baz Luhrmann’s “The Great Gatsby” to LEGO movies that helped revive Warner Bros.’ feature animation activity. Now she’s been entrusted with one of filmdom’s crown jewels, James Bond. Valenti’s first move was to turn to seasoned franchise film pros, Amy Pascal and David Heyman, to shepherd Agent 007 into a new chapter with a new star. Amazon MGM also has a big swing coming in June with Mattel’s followup to “Barbie,” the live-action “Masters of the Universe.” Title: CEO, Warner Music Group Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Kyncl has played captain at Warner Music Group as it’s undergone major restructuring, including last year’s elevation of Elliot Grainge to CEO of subsidiary Atlantic Music Group and waves of company-wide layoffs. And while full-year annual profit for 2025 declined 23%, largely due to the termination of WMG’s distribution deal with BMG, publishing and recorded music revenue thrived, surging 14.6 percent to $1.87 billion. Much of that can be credited to the success of various WMG artists — Rosé, Alex Warren and Sombr, to name a few. Under Kyncl’s leadership in 2025, WMG struck major licensing deals with AI startups Klay and Udio, the latter of which it had previously sued for copyright infringement. He has an ambitious blueprint to lead the company into the future — he even wrote a “10 year plan” for the company — but its execution will be a challenge. Title: Chairman, Sony Pictures Television Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Le Goy is a longtime Sony Pictures Entertainment insider who is well positioned to help drive the parent company’s efforts to find connections among the company’s autonomous entertainment-focused units: Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Music and Sony PlayStation. He previously headed worldwide distribution and networks, which gives him a strong sense of the company’s range of production and channel assets in the U.S. and abroad. Before Sony, Le Goy oversaw European distribution for Disney TV. Title: Head of Global TV, Amazon MGM Studios Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: After a long run at Netflix, Peter Friedlander in October moved across town to lead global TV for Amazon MGM Studios. His front-row seat to the Netflix revolution will serve him well as Amazon MGM calibrates its TV strategy for Prime Video and elsewhere. Friedlander is extremely well connected in the creative community after years at Netflix and at Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman’s Playtone banner before that. All of those contacts and a big hunk of the goodwill he has in the bank will come in handy as the studio looks for growth. Title: CEO, Microsoft Gaming Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Beginning with an internship in 1988, Phil Spencer has been a Microsoft employee for longer than many of his biggest fans have been alive. Now head of Microsoft Gaming, Spencer oversees brands including Xbox, Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda and Activision Blizzard. Throughout many years at the company, Spencer has launched several consoles, including the current generation Xbox Series X and S and this year’s debut of the ROG Ally handheld collection, and overseen video game franchises including “Call of Duty,” “Minecraft,” “Halo,” “Gears of War,” “Starfield,” “Doom” and “Forza.” While navigating industry criticism and fan backlash this year amid workforce reductions and price increases, Spencer has also drawn praise for his commitment to backing Xbox’s subscription Game Pass service and licensing out Xbox exclusives to PlayStation and Nintendo platforms, making those the new priority drivers of growth as console sales dwindle. The successful adaptation of the “Fallout” gaming franchise into an Amazon Prime Video drama series was another feather in Spencer’s cap. Title: Chairman and CEO, Take-Two Interactive Held job since: 2007 Sources of power: Strauss Zelnick began his career in Hollywood at Columbia Pictures, home video distributor Vestron and Twentieth Century Fox. But he segued into big-league investing and video games nearly 20 years ago through his ZMC investment vehicle. Take-Two is home to one of gaming’s most valuable franchises, “Grand Theft Auto.” The company will be under renewed scrutiny in 2026 after multiple delays in the release of the long-waited “Grand Theft Auto VI.” The most recent was the news from November 2025 that the title would be pushed by six months from May to November 2026. By that time it will have been 13 year since the debut of “GTA 5.” Outside of Take-Two, Zelnick may well wind up with a bigger footprint in entertainment if ZMC finds opportunities in the M&A wave that is gripping traditional media and entertainment. Title: Founder, chairman and CEO, Roku Held job since: 2002 Sources of power: Wood has generally kept a low profile in Hollywood since his entrepreneurial drive lead him into media in the late 1990s. He represents the “Halt and Catch Fire” era of cutting-edge digital products and savvy business leaders that emerged from the tech boom in Texas in the 1980s and ‘90s. Wood was early to see the opportunity for more consumer-friendly on-demand platforms, and that positions Roku well for the future as streaming becomes the dominant TV and home entertainment delivery system. Title: Founder and CEO, Spotify Held job since: 2006 Sources of power: After more than two decades in his role at Spotify, Ek is poised to step down from CEO at the streaming company at the end of 2025 while remaining executive chairman. His making the change — to the degree he actually steps back — on a high note: Throughout his tenure, he made Spotify the premium destination for streaming and saved an industry that was collapsing under the weight of illegal downloading. He ushered Spotify to its current market cap of $118 billion and grew its audience to 713 million active users and 281 million subscribers, up more than 10% from 2024. Ek spent the year diversifying Spotify’s outside investments, inking a deal with Netflix to stream a collection of original podcasts and another with Amazon to give advertisers using Amazon DSP programmatic access to Spotify’s streaming audio and video inventory. Title: Co-CEO, Comcast Held job since: 2025 (announced to take effect in January) Sources of power: Will have significant say over company’s future direction as Roberts cedes some of his CEO duties.Cavanagh is taking more of the reins at Comcast as Brian Roberts looks to do more with exploring technology. He brings to Comcast an outlook forged in part by time on Wall Street. He was He was the co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase’s Corporate & Investment Bank from 2012 to 2014, and served as JPMorgan Chase’s CFO for six years. Look for Cavanagh to have a big say over Comcast’s policies governing potential mergers-and-acquisitions; investment in sports rights; and balancing the need to grow its streaming assets while keeping interest in its still-sizable linear TV footprint. Title: Chief Creative Officer, Pixar Animation Studios Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: Pixar’s has had its highs and lows at the box office in recent years but the animation studio’s brand nonetheless remains a magnet for kid and family audiences. Docter stepped up to the top creative job in 2018 when the company faced a moment of sudden transition after the exit of longtime creative leader John Lasseter. Docter was one of Pixar’s first employees long before the pioneering CG animation shop was part of Disney. He is respected for maintaining Pixar’s culture of creativity even as it has stepped up its production slate. Title: VP of Film, Netflix Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: Longtime Sony executive Belgrad has spent his career making theatrical movies across a spectrum of budgets, making him an ideal partner for Dan Lin at the Netflix film vertical. Belgrad, for starters, manages the streamer’s important relationship with pay-one partner Sony Pictures (the union that gave us the “KPop Demon Hunters” juggernaut). Belgrad has been vital to get live-action features for Netflix out of that deal, including the upcoming “People We Meet On Vacation” and Kevin Hart’s “72 Hours.” He’s also brought key new filmmakers into the fold — like Clint Bentley, Lena Dunham and James Mangold — and scored big auction packages including the “Eloise” movie with Amy Sherman-Palladino and producer Ryan Reynolds; as well as “Unabom” with Russell Crowe and Shailene Woodley. Title: President, Disney Live Action and 20th Century Studios Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: The exceedingly likable Greenbaum took a giant leap up from his longtime post at Searchlight Pictures to replace Sean Bailey at Disney’s mothership this year. He now oversees all live action filmmaking for the Walt Disney label and acts as steward for 20th Century Studios. Across both, he shepherds key filmmakers and – as the town has taken note – is actively courting original IP to serve younger audiences (particularly boys). Over his first few months, Greenbaum landed an action-drama package about the Hawaii mafia with Martin Scorsese and Dwayne Johnson, a hot time travel thriller from Edward Berger and Austin Butler, and the rights to Katherine Rundell’s fantasy series “Impossible Creatures.” Title: CEO, Neon Held job since: 2017 Sources of power: Tom Quinn launched Neon in 2017 and quickly established it as one of the hottest brands in the indie film world. Under his leadership, Neon has become a major awards season player. It captured Best Picture for 2019’s “Parasite,” which made history as the first foreign film to win the top prize. Then pulled off the feat a second time with 2024’s “Anora,” a $6 million dark comedy that ranks as one of the lowest budgetted Best Picture victors ever. He’s also released such Oscar-nominated films as “Anatomy of a Fall,” “Triangle of Sadness,” and “I, Tonya.” Beyond arthouse fare, Neon scored at the box office with a series of twisty horror flicks, “The Monkey” and “Longlegs,” from Osgood Perkins, with whom the company has a first-look deal. However, Perkins’ latest film, “Keeper,” was a rare miss. In 2025, Neon released one of its most critically acclaimed slates, distributing Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just An Accident” and Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” both of which are expected to factor heavily into the Oscar race. Title: Chairman, Focus Features Held job since: 2016 Sources of power: Peter Kujawski is a well-liked figure in the film community for his enthusiasm for movies and moviegoing, and for his taste in filmmakers and projects. He’s been a steady hand at Focus Features since 2016, but and he had an earlier run at the unit’s outset in 2002, where he played a big part in the releases of such notable pics as Michel Gondry’s “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” Sofia Coppola’s Lost In Translation” and Gus Van Sant’s “Milk.” His 2025 fall and winter slate was as an ambitious as any distributor that tackled adult dramas: “Bugonia,” “Hamnet” and “Song Sung Blue.” Title: CEO and Founder, Blumhouse Held job since: 2015 Sources of power: Blum has made his mark in Hollywood with his distinctive approach to horror films and his financial prowess. In short, he figured out to do micro-budget production at scale. And even in a year when the much-anticipated sequel “MEGAN 2.0” fell flat, the company’s eight theatrical film releases in 2025 still passed the $1 billion mark at the box office. Blumhouse has also expanded significantly since the current iteration of the company was formed in 2015. This year, Blumhouse bolstered its core business by completing its merger with James Wan’s Atomic Monster. Title: Co-Founder, A24 Held job since: 2012 Sources of power: The eternally mysterious Fenkel and Katz, who won’t even agree to be photographed on the annual Oscars red carpet, continued their streak as one of the most enviable labels in indie film while quietly growing their company from within. A24 saw the most profitable run of its existence this year, largely thanks to the overperformance of Celine Song’s “Materialists” (over $100 million at the global box office on a $20 million budget). Strong singles and doubles came with Eva Victor’s “Sorry, Baby,” “Friendship” and “Bring Her Back,” and “Mary Supreme” is set to light up the specialty box office at Christmas. At the top of this year, Thrive Capital closed an investment round that sources say brings A24’s valuation to roughly $3.5 billion. Title: VP of Original Series, Netflix Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Howe got the nod to run original scripted series for the U.S. and Canada at Netflix after her longtime boss, Peter Friedlander, departed for a new gig as head of global series for Amazon MGM. Howe has been a key player for years in Netflix’s original content strategy, playing an instrumental role in such series as “Bridgerton,” the Emmy-winning “Beef” and “The Diplomat.” Now she’s heading up the biggest sandbox in series development. Title: Chairman, Bravo and Peacock Unscripted Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Berwick has seen her job description and title at NBCUniversal change numerous times over the past decade, but her focus rarely wavered. She has been the driving executive force behind Bravo even before NBC bought the cable channel in 2002. With NBCUniversal slimming down through the spinoff of USA Network, Syfy, Oxygen, E!, Berwick’s new role in the restructuring unveiled in January 2025 is tailored to her strengths. That’s demonstrated by Peacock’s success with unscripted shows including “The Traitors’ and “Love Island USA” and the fans flocking to BravoCon events in recent years. Title: President, CBS Studios Held job since: 2004 Sources of power: David Stapf is among the elite list of top Hollywood executives who began their career in publicity and communications before transitioning into senior management. After helping launch iconic series like “Friends” and “ER” at Warner Bros. TV, he moved to a current programming job at CBS in 1999, stewarding series like “Everybody Loves Raymond.” In 2004 he moved over to CBS’ in-house studio, where he was key to the launch and growth of “NCIS” and its spinoffs. He also developed “The Good Wife” and its spinoffs with Robert and Michelle King, and is guiding Kathy Bates’ successful “Matlock” series. Stapf brought the “Star Trek” world back to life on TV with “Star Trek: Discovery,” “Picard,” “Lower Decks,” “Strange New Worlds” and “Starfleet Academy.” In late night, he oversaw the launches of Stephen Colbert’s and James Corden’s talkers — and their wind downs (including Colbert’s exit this coming May). And he launched the first new daytime soap in years, CBS’ “Beyond the Gates.” Stapf even expanded his domain as a supplier for streamers like Netflix, and as an international producer on shows including “Colin From Accounts” and “King & Conqueror.” Title: Chairman of Business Affairs and Operations, NBCUniversal Entertainment Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Jimmy Horowitz is widely respected as an honest broker and a shrewd dealmaker. He’s been a major player in driving business and monetization across the film studio for decades; more recently his purview has expanded to include television. He’s connections and his experience will no doubt come into play as NBCUniversal completes the Versant spinoff and reinvents itself once again around NBC, Universal film and TV production, Bravo and Peacock and theme parks. Title: President, Disney Television Studios and Global Original Television Strategy, Disney Entertainment Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Schrier came up the ranks under John Langraf at FX, which gives him a level of respect and connections in the creative community that he will need to help reinvent Disney’s TV production operations. He was hand-picked by Dana Walden to steer the TV studios’ business operations. In recent years, Schrier has invested in time and resources into growing Disney’s local-language activity for Disney+ and other production activity outside the U.S. Title: President, Warner Bros. Television Group Held job since: 2024 Source of power: The future of Warner Bros. Television Group may be uncertain as Netflix and Paramount Skydance battle it out for the studio. But there’s no doubt that Paul has played an enormous role in the company’s success over the past 30 years. He’s a well regarded dealmaker who has always nurtured strong relationships with WB’s top talent. Title: President, ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: OConnell has the hard task of managing the operations of ABC News and leading business operations for Disney’s linear networks, including ABC, FX Networks, Freeform and National Geographic. She’s managing businesses that are inevitably in decline while Disney’s streaming platforms gain steam. But Disney is also working across the company to leverage the reach and deep footprint (for now) of ABC, FX and the larger cablers to help bolster Disney+ and Hulu and to squeeze more value out of high-priced premium shows. OConnell earned the esteem of her colleagues by handling the tricky transition of leadership at ABC News just a few months after her role was expanded to encompass the division. Title: CEO, AMC Networks Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Dolan has been slowly shifting the centers of gravity that the company she took over in February 2023. AMC Networks is home to AMC, SundanceTV, IFC, WeTV and BBC America, as well as streamers Shudder, Acorn TV and ALLBLK. Dolan worked with Netflix and HBO Max to find bigger showcases for AMC-branded shows. She also has pull as a member of the family that controls the closely held company. Title: CEO, AMC Theatres Held job since: 2016 Sources of power: Adam Aron, who became the CEO of AMC Theatres in 2016, has learned to embrace the disruption. Over the past few years, he’s survived a pandemic that devastated his business and withstood rollercoaster share prices amid a box office that has failed to regain its pre-pandemic strength. Rather than relying entirely on the studios that supply the blockbusters, Aron has made several attempts to expand AMC’s business outside of box office, including the viral “Dune” popcorn bucket and other movie-themed merchandise that has contributed tens of millions in annual sales. He also spearheaded the chain’s foray into distribution with 2023’s commercial hit “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” concert film and this year’s “Taylor Swift: The Release Party of a Showgirl.” And he turned AMC into the de facto choice for movie lovers after hiring Nicole Kidman for the chain’s now-iconic promotional campaign to get people back to the movies. (Patrons even petitioned when AMC attempted to shorten the commercial, in which Kidman famously declares that “somehow, heartbreak feels good in a place like this.”) Now that’s movie magic. Title: CEO, Imax Corp. Held job since: 2009 Sources of power: Blockbuster directors and stars like Christopher Nolan, Tom Cruise and Ryan Coogler are known to rhapsodize about the singular experience of watching their films in Imax, a premium film format that has skyrocketed in popularity since COVID. That makes Richard Gelfond, who controls access to the finite number of screens that tend to generate outsized ticket sales, a very popular person when those mega-watt talents have a new movie to unveil. Thanks to Gelfond’s key relationships, Imax has benefited in recent years as audiences opt for premium large formats to distinguish the out-of-the-home moviegoing experience. When Gelfond joined Imax in 1994, the company was best known for supplying science documentaries to theaters inside museums. Over the decades, Gelfond, who became CEO in 2009, has turned the technology brand into a legitimate powerhouse in Hollywood. Title: President, Paramount Television Studios Held Job Since: 2025 Sources of power: Matt Thunell sits atop Paramount Television Studios operations, a unit formed in August, post-merger out of the assets of Skydance Television, Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Nickelodeon Live Action and Awesomeness. He’s got an opportunity to rev up a franchise factory for the enlarged studio. Paramount TV Studios is home to the Taylor Sheridan-verse, Paramount+’s “Yellowjackets,” among other shows. Thunell worked on “Stranger Things” at Netflix before he joined Skydance to head the TV unit in 2022. Title: CEO, Legendary Entertainment Held job since: 2017 Sources of power: Grode may not be as flashy as some chiefs in town, but his stable of intellectual property provides all the shine he needs to keep Legendary at the top of the popcorn conversation. 2025 brought the staggering success of “A Minecraft Movie,” the almost billion-dollar-grosser that Grode’s studio executed with Warner Bros. While Legendary will be moving south of Burbank for a new distribution pact with Paramount, the label will release a third “Dune” film in 2026, as well as more monsters from the Godzilla universe and a hotly anticipated adaptation of beloved arcade game “Street Fighter.” Title: Vice Chair of Worldwide Production, Legendary Entertainment Held job since: 2016 Sources of power: Parent’s range of experience — from a long run at Universal Pictures to MGM to New Line Cinema early in her career — gives her the perspective and business connections to drive promising film and TV projects for Legendary. Her depth alone makes Legendary an attractive partner for studios looking for reliable popcorn fare. Title: President, Searchlight Pictures Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: Greenfield rose up the leadership ladder at Searchlight after working as a film producer and at the Sundance Institute. He’s highly regarded in the industry for his taste and for championing strong filmmakers. He was a key player in helping Searchlight make the transition into Disney after the 21st Century Fox acquisition in 2019. Title: CEO, Fox Entertainment Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Rob Wade was already a reality TV veteran in the U.K. (“Big Brother,” “I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here”) when he crossed the pond in 2005 to work on the first season of ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars.” He eventually became the showrunner of “DWTS.” He also headed up U.S. TV at Simon Cowell’s Syco Entertainment, working on shows like “America’s Got Talent” and “The X Factor.” After a stint as head of entertainment development at BBC Worldwide, Wade joined Fox in 2017 as president of alternative entertainment and specials, overseeing an unscripted slate such as “The Masked Singer,” “Lego Masters” and “Hell’s Kitchen.” He was there when Disney acquired Fox’s studio operations, making the network a stand-alone indie — and giving him and then-CEO Charlie Collier license to be entrepreneurial. When Collier left for Roku in 2022, Wade was tapped by Lachlan Murdoch to continue leading Fox’s evolution in entertainment. Title: President and CEO, Starz Held job since: 2019 Sources of power: Starz is settling into its next chapter after completing a long and complicated spinoff process from parent company Lionsgate. Now Hirsch and his team have more control to guide Starz’s transition away from linear cable to subscription streaming. Hirsch’s background in marketing has helped Starz make the most of its most popular franchises such as the “Power” drama series and the “Outlander” fantasy universe. Title: President and Chairman, A+E Global Media Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: Buccieri has worked to transform A+E Global Media’s operations since he was promoted to the top job in 2018. He’s made savvy licensing deals that protected the company’s core business but generated cash flow from the FAST channel licensing bonanza of the past few years. Under Buccieri, Lifetime, History and A&E Network have gained respect for investing in a slate of event programs rather than joining the original series arms race. He’s also highly regarded as a manager – skills he will need as parent companies Disney and Hearst quietly shop their long-standing joint venture to prospective buyers. Title: Chair & Chief Creative Officer, Lionsgate Television Group Held job since: 2013 Sources of power: In an industry filled with executive shuffles and organizational changes, Kevin Beggs has been a stalwart at Lionsgate Television Group. He first joined the company when it was a much smaller entity and helped grow it over the years to critical acclaim with signature hits like “Mad Men,” “Weeds” and “Orange Is the New Black.” This year, Lionsgate earned 25 Emmy nominations — including 23 Emmy nods for Apple TV+’s “The Studio,” which went on to win a record-breaking 13 Emmys — the most ever for a comedy in a single season. Overseeing a group that includes Lionsgate TV, Lionsgate Alternative TV, Lionsgate Worldwide TV Distribution, 3 Arts Entertainment and Debmar-Mercury, Beggs boasts current series hits including Season 5 of “Ghosts” (CBS), “The Hunting Wive” (Netflix), Season 3 of “Power Book IV: Force” (Starz), “Spartacus: House of Ashur” (Starz), “The Rainmaker” (USA Network), Season 13 of “My Big Fat Fabulous Life” (TLC) and the syndicated strips “Family Feud” and “Sherri.” In addition, 3 Arts is involved with shows like “Hacks” (HBO Max) and “Nobody Wants This” (Netflix). Title: Global Head of Music, YouTube Held job since: 2016 Sources of power: Cohen is coming up on a decade of steering music activity for the streaming behemoth. His deep background in the business have come in handy as YouTube debates issues around AI use in the making of music and videos showcased on the site. More recently he’s waded into a dispute with Variety’s sibling publication Billboard about how YouTube streams are counted in Billboard’s chart rankings of music sales. Title: VP of Audio, Twitch and Games, Amazon Held job since: 2012/2023 Sources of power: A graduate of Stanford and Harvard Law School, Boom’s remit sprawls across Amazon Music, Audible, Twitch, Amazon Games, and Creator Services, the latter of which is a new program that leads the company’s creator-led podcast studio under the Wondery brand, including Dax Shepard’s Golden Globe-nominated “Armchair Expert,” “Mind the Game” with Lebron James and “New Heights” with Jason and Travis Kelce. Initiatives in the past year include Bad Bunny’s final San Juan residency show, “No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí: Una Más,” which became Amazon Music’s all-time most-watched livestream; working with Bad Bunny to launch STEM education programs, agricultural support, and economic development in Puerto Rico; welcoming media-challenged artists like Justin Bieber and Lizzo to Twitch; and developing Alexa+ into a music-recommendation tool. Title: President, Crunchyroll Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: As anime fandom has grown exponentially, Crunchyroll is well positioned to capture subscribers, audience and street cred with fans. The subscription streaming platform owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment has been a success story for the studio, which has made a point of investing in anime assets. Crunchyroll’s emergence on a larger stage was cemented in September when its feature film “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” lead the U.S. box office for two weekends. Purini has deep credentials with fans thanks to his long run at anime shop Funimation before Sony engineered its merger with Crunchyroll in 2021. Title: Chairman and CEO, AEG Presents Held job since: 2011 Sources of power: In any other universe, the man at the top of a live-entertainment empire that includes Taylor Swift’s “Eras” tour, Elton John’s five-year “Farewell Yellow Brick Road” trek, the largest ticketed concert in U.S. history (Zach Bryan at Michigan Stadium: 112,408 fans), the Rolling Stones’ recent tours, Coachella, Stagecoach, Sabrina Carpenter, Morgan Wallen and much more would be the Goliath of his industry. However, AEG Live’s main competition is the mighty Live Nation. But Marciano and his AEG Live team give Rapino & Co. a run for their money every year. Partnerships — with Louis Messina for Swift, with Goldenvoice’s Paul Tollett for Coachella and Stagecoach, with Latin powerhouse CMN Events — are a key strength, and he’s also more than doubled the company’s venue portfolio to over 100 (which include L.A.’s Crypto.com Arena and the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas), and also runs other iconic events like London’s BST Hyde Park, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and many more across the globe. Titles: Co-Founders and Co-Presidents, Sony Pictures Classics Held job since: 1992 Sources of power: “Michael and Tom,” as they are unanimously known, are part of the furniture here in Hollywood. They are lifelong devotees of art house titles that, more often than not, find a foothold in the mainstream and keep their parent label Sony Pictures in the awards conversation each year. For 2025, they rolled out Jodie Foster’s psychological murder mystery “A Private Life” and Iraq’s stellar bet for this year’s Oscars in “The President’s Cake.” And they may have a dark horse best actor winner on their hands for Ethan Hawke in Richard Linklater’s “Blue Moon.” Title: Founder, Chairman and CEO, Allen Media Group Held job since: 1993 Sources of power: Byron Allen has demonstrated that he has tenacity to spare in building the media company that he started with a single syndicated TV show that he hosted. Today, Allen Media Group encompasses more than a dozen TV stations in small- and medium-size markets, the Weather Channel and niche lifestyle and genre channels. He’s been expanding in streaming with the college sports and lifestyle platform HBCUGo platform. He also owns the indie film distribution service Freestyle Digital Media. Title: Chief Brand Officer, Walt Disney Co.; President, Disney Entertainment Marketing Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Asad Ayaz has the single-biggest marketing portfolio of any CMO in entertainment. And because Disney is Disney, he has the extra burden of serving as both promoter and protector of the big-D brand that is synonymous with America, apple pie and Mickey Mouse. Ayaz also has a huge remit in overseeing all ballyhoo activity at the studio’s film and TV production imprints and Disney+. Title: President of Marketing, Direct to Consumer and Disney Entertainment Television Held Job Since: 2025 Sources of power: Ryan oversees a roster of platforms and brands of size and scope that would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. With her promotion in August, Ryan added oversight of all Disney’s direct to consumer marketing in addition to Disney’s TV studios and linear channels. The job of bringing viewers to the screen has become more complicated in the subscription streaming age. It falls to Ryan and her teams to help build up Disney’s growth engines of the future. Title: Head of Marketing, Amazon MGM Studios Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Sue Kroll is skilled at selling movies. The former Warner Bros marketing chief was responsible for major promotional campaigns, including “Harry Potter,” “Lord of the Rings” and Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” trilogy, as well as awards fare like “Argo” and “The Blind Side.” So when Amazon MGM decided to get into the theatrical business and ramp up its film slate, the studio recruited Kroll – reuniting her with Courtenay Valenti, Amazon MGM’s head of film and Warner Bros. former production chief – to market its movies to the masses. The studio admittedly hasn’t had a ton of theatrical offerings since Amazon MGM committed to the big screen. (Making movies takes time.) So 2026 releases, including the Chris Pratt-led “Mercy,” Ryan Gosling’s space drama “Project Hail Mary” and Colleen Hoover adaptation “Verity,” will be a better showcase of Kroll’s talent. And once they get around to casting the next James Bond, she’ll be responsible for shaking and stirring the 007 franchise for a new generation. Title: Chief Marketing Officer, Universal Pictures Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: Moses is one of filmdom’s most respected and well-liked marketing mavens. He has the experience and the No. 1 opening weekends to back it up. His latest victory that impressed fellow CMOs far and wide was his assignment to open not one but two movie musicals tied to a beloved Broadway property with a one-year gap in between. Moses and his team made sure that you couldn’t miss the candy-colored fanfare for “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good.” Next up he faces a Homeric challenge with the release of Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey” in July. Title: CEO, ITV Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: McCall has carefully managed ITV’s response to the rapidly changing business landscape for media. She took the reins after her predecessor acquired a slew of small production banners to feed the company’s content pipelines. She came in as a strong experienced executive manager who helped quiet the persistent rumors that ITV would be sold, although that may change as another wave of merger mania grips Hollywood. Title: CEO, Canal+ Group Held job since: 2015 Sources of power: Maxime Saada, a shrewd businessman whose mantra is “buy less, own more,” has transformed Canal+ Group from a largely French pay-TV operator into a leaner, financially robust global media company spanning Europe, Africa and Asia. Since taking the helm in 2015, Saada has quadrupled the group’s subscriber base to more than 40 million across 70 countries, while tightening cost structures, cutting losses and sustaining a €5 billion annual investment in content. Saada joined Canal+ Group in 2004 and moved through the ranks, has fueled the company’s growth through targeted acquisitions, including stakes in The Pictures Company in the U.S., Nordic pay-TV group Viaplay and Asian streamer Viu, capped this year by the takeover of MultiChoice Group, cementing Canal+’s leadership in Africa. In parallel, Saada secured a 34% stake in UGC, reinforcing vertical integration alongside Studiocanal, the producer behind “Paddington.” Title: Chairman and CEO, Mediawan Held job since: 2015 Sources of power: In an industry reshaped by consolidation and volatility, Capton has engineered a rare European success story with Mediawan. The self-made French producer co-founded Mediawan with telecom billionaire Xavier Niel and investment banker Matthieu Pigasse as a special-purpose acquisition vehicle in 2015. Ten years and (likely) over a thousand transatlantic flights later, Capton has turned Mediawan into one of Europe’s leading production-distribution players amid a fiercely competitive market, generating upwards of $1 billion in annual revenues and housing over 80 labels worldwide, including the producers of “The Count of Monte Cristo,” “Miraculous” and “Call My Agent” — with a movie spinoff in post boasting George Clooney and Eva Longoria cameos, and a U.S. remake set in the sports representation worlds with HBO and SpringHill. Capton has been the architect of this international expansion, gaining the trust of high-profile talent and spearheading headline-making acquisitions that put the company on the English-language map, including majority stakes in Oscar-winning banners such as Brad Pitt, Jeremy Kleiner and Dede Gardner’s Plan B (“Adolescence,””F1”), and “Slow Horses” producer See-Saw Films. Capton also just enlisted Margot Robbie’s LuckyChap for a joint venture based in London. Title: Founder and CEO, Mubi Held job since: 2007 Sources of power: A Turkish-born film fanatic, Efe Cakarel had never been to a film festival when he wrote the business plan for Mubi in 2007, envisioning an edgier alternative to Netflix. Eighteen years later, the London-headquartered company has evolved from a niche streamer into a full-fledged studio spanning theatrical distribution and production, with more than 400 employees across 15 markets. Mubi broke through in the U.S. with Coralie Fargeat’s body-horror breakout “The Substance,” which it distributed in theaters and grossed $83 million worldwide in 2024. It also earned five Oscar nominations, which meant that the ceremony last March marked Cakarel’s first trip to the Academy Awards. Cakarel, who says he “built Mubi brick by brick,” remains bullish on reinvigorating moviegoing culture. Title: Vice Chair, CJ Group Held job since: 2004 Sources of power: Miky Lee has spent the past two decades building the infrastructure that helped rebuild Korean’s entertainment industry. Appointed vice chair in 2004, she oversaw CJ’s shift from domestic film and TV operations into a vertically integrated entertainment group with reach across Asia and the U.S. Under her watch, CJ-backed projects included Oscar winner “Parasite,” while platforms like KCON and the Mnet Asian Music Awards grew from local showcases into international fixtures. As global demand accelerated, Lee pushed CJ further into the U.S., backing CJ ENM’s majority acquisition of Endeavor Content, now Fifth Season, and the launch of the First Light StoryHouse label with Janet Yang. As Korean film, TV and music have broken firmly into the U.S. mainstream, Lee remains behind one of the few companies built to operate across all three at scale. Title: CEO, Banijay Entertainment and Banijay Live Held job since: 2013 Sources of power: Marco Bassetti is navigating the current age of consolidation without losing sight of the bottom line. As streamer budgets shrink and linear channels lose relevance he is judiciously continuing to grow the company’s footprint while attaining scale with a wide range of premium content. Scale gives Banijay leverage in its negotiations with streaming giants and bolsters its efforts to retain IP ownership rather than selling it outright. The company’s production side, that includes brands such as “MasterChef,” “Big Brother,” “Peaky Blinders” and “Black Mirror,” is looking to expand its reach in English-speaking markets, including the U.S., though Bassetti is not planning to compete directly with Hollywood studios in the scripted sphere. Diversifying beyond traditional TV content, Banijay since 2023 holds a majority stake in live entertainment outfit Balich Wonder Studios that is driving growth thanks to production of high-profile events such as the opening ceremony of the upcoming Milan Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games. Banijay has also made inroads in the creator-led entertainment space, notably its Creators Lab launched with YouTube. Title: CEO, Versant Media Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Lazarus has taken on the job of transitioning NBCUniversal’s largest linear cable channels into a new company dubbed Versant Media, which will formally become a separate publicly traded entity from NBCUniversal in early 2026. Lazarus is well positioned to steer those outlets — USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, Syfy and Golf Channel – into their next chapter given his roots in pay TV as a Turner Broadcasting alum. He’s exiting out of NBCUniversal after a 15-year run. Title: Chairman, NBCUniversal Media Group Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: NBCUniversal is investing heavily in sports and entertainment franchises. Matt Strauss’ job is to make sure the company makes a profit. NBCU has in recent months tested some unique strategies, including the launch of a new sports-focused cable network that delivers much of the content already available to users of Peacock. The new outlet lets people still connected to traditional systems enjoy the content and serves as a bargaining chip in negotiations with video distributors. Title: President, Sony Pictures Television Studios Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Pope has had a broad range of experience over the past 25 years, from rising fast at NBC to helping to launch Chernin Entertainment and Charter Spectrum’s programming venture. All of that background is helping her lead Sony Pictures Television. It’s the studio division that takes the company’s riskiest bets in scripted TV. SPT fielded a notable new series this year for Fox with the medical drama “Doc,” which debuted to strong reviews and audience in January. The series came back quickly — by design — with Season 2 debuting in September just as Season 1 episodes landed on Netflix. Title: Chief Financial Officer, Warner Bros. Discovery Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Wiedenfels is on track to take on the tough assignment of charting a future course for CNN, TNT, TBS, Discovery, HGTV, Food Network and other WBD linear channels. If Paramount prevails in buying all of WBD, however, Wiedenfels won’t have an empire. Although the executive became a lightning rod amid WBD’s extensive cost cutting campaigns, Wiedenfels will be sought after as a media CEO after his experience restructuring WBD. Title: President, Disney Advertising Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Ferro has become a key figure in Disney’s TV kingdom as the company opened Disney+ to advertising and has expanded in streaming with ESPN and Hulu. She has deep knowledge of Disney’s operations and the value of Disney’s biggest brands. She’s earned the trust of Disney’s C-suite after delivering for the Mouse House in difficult times. Title: Chairman, Global Advertising and Partnerships, NBCUniversal Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Marshall has grown his stature at NBCUniversal ever since he became the top executive in advertising sales. He distinguished himself in sales for the 2024 Paris Olympics and this year’s “Saturday Night Live” 50th anniversary celebration. He’s also been a driver of the company’s upcoming plans to celebrate NBC’s 100th anniversary and to go big on live sports. Title: President, Roku Media Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Collier was recruited to rev up Roku’s core media business by stepping up original content commissions and enhancing its advertising sales operation. Collier has worked to capitalize on Roku’s strengths by targeting its original series to complement trends and popular shows on channels and apps carried by Roku. He has also expanded its presence on Madison Avenue, tapping into his decades of experience in programming and ad sales. Title: Group CEO, Fremantle Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: If you’re in the business of game shows, then you’re in business with Fremantle. Mullin leads the production banner behind “American Idol,” “So You Think You Can Dance” and a host of game shows ranging from “The Price is Right” to “Family Feud.” On Mullin’s watch Fremantle has also expanded its efforts in scripted content. Title: CEO, Sony Interactive Entertainment’s PlayStation Studios Held job since: 2019 Sources of power: Hulst oversees more than 20 individual studio groups and partnerships, which are responsible for some the industry’s most influential games including “The Last of Us,” “Ghost of Yotei,” “God of War,” “Helldivers II” and “Death Stranding 2.” While he was pulled back from serving as co-CEO of the PlayStation business overall earlier this year, Hulst holds significant power in the gaming biz and guides SIE’s film and TV strategy. Title: CEO, Mattel Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: Yes, Kreiz is interested in selling toys — lots of them — across multiple different categories (dolls, toddler, preschool and more). But he’s repositioned the company to better exploit opportunities in other lines of business with Mattel’s fan-favorite brands, including with the company’s first movie: box-office bonanza “Barbie,” which indisputably became a cultural moment. He has loaded up more projects in the pipeline in film, TV, consumer products, games, live events and experiences, publishing and music. Kreiz’s background as CEO of Fox Kids Europe, Maker Studios and Endemol over the past three decades affords him a keen understanding of how to capitalize on the value of Mattel’s multigenerational fandoms through media. Title: Founder and CEO, Epic Games Held job since: 1991 Sources of power: Sweeney’s company parachuted into the zeitgeist with the hugely popular “Fortnite,” and the game’s success last year attracted Disney as a major strategic partner. The outspoken — if not combative — exec also has stood up to tech giants Apple and Google, battling them in court to try to force them to make their app store policies fairer for independent developers. Meanwhile, Epic’s Unreal Engine 3D graphics platform has been eagerly embraced by professional vfx artists and creators for its ease of use. Title: Chair, Dalian Wanda Group Held job since: 1988 Sources of power: For a decade, Wang Jianlin was the most visible symbol of China’s global entertainment ambitions, snapping up marquee Western assets and building the world’s largest cinema footprint. That expansion unwound after Beijing tightened controls on outbound capital and targeted highly leveraged overseas acquisitions, forcing Wanda into debt restructuring and the exit from assets such as AMC Theatres and Legendary Entertainment. What remains is narrower but durable. While Wang no longer controls Wanda Film, Wanda Cinemas continue to operate at scale under a brand synonymous with his legacy and are largely housed within Wanda Plaza properties he still owns. Overseas, Hoyts preserves exhibition muscle in Australia and New Zealand. Most resilient is Infront Sports & Media, whose grip on premium sports rights anchors Wang’s influence beyond film. His power now rests in infrastructure rather than dealmaking. The Business of Entertainment

Title: AI trade isn’t dead: An inside look into Wall Street's lucrative data center deals

As fears mount that the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble has popped, Wall Street dealmaking is being kept alive by a fundamental problem: bitcoin BTC$88,949.46 miners and data center developers still require serious amounts of power. “M&A work is still ongoing as people still need power,” said Joe Nardini, head of investment banking at B. Riley Securities, in an interview with CoinDesk. Nardini said demand for power from bitcoin miners remains “huge,” but added that the pull from AI and high-performance computing (HPC) is “even bigger,” with data center and mining clients reporting sustained demand for GPU-ready facilities. After the bitcoin halving cut rewards in half, miners faced a severe margin squeeze even with prices near or above $100,000 and increasingly pivoted to hosting AI and high-performance computing (HPC) hardware in their existing data centers. This helped drive sharp gains in some BTC mining stocks this year as AI hype swept through the market. Read more: GPU Gold Rush: Why Bitcoin Miners Are Powering AI’s Expansion Earlier in 2025, rising concerns about artificial intelligence and lofty valuations erased significant market value from major tech names, including Nvidia (NVDA) and other AI beneficiaries, as investors took profits and reassessed whether prices had outpaced fundamentals. AI infrastructure specialist CoreWeave’s (CRWV) stock also retreated and is now more than 50% below its June peak. Does this mean the AI trend is over? Nardini doesn't think so, and he has some simple logic behind this that he asks executives: Do clients have demand for the data center capacity they’ve built? “Yes.” Do they have tenants? “Yes.” Are they good tenants? “Yes.” Are they getting good rates? “Yes.” Across multiple conversations, he said the message has been consistent: “So the demand is still there.” In fact, Hut 8 shares rallied as much as 20% last week after signing a 15-year, $7 billion lease with Fluidstack for 245 megawatts of IT capacity at its River Bend campus. “Despite the recent selloff, these companies have been well rewarded with higher valuation multiples and the ability to raise capital at attractive valuations and terms," he said. This demand is still underpinning valuations and, increasingly, M&A negotiations, according to Nardini. In competitive situations with high-quality power and viable locations, he said, dollars per megawatt (a financial metric for value for each megawatt of electricity) can look “very attractive.” He stated that one process involved a valuation of over $400,000 per megawatt, with the potential to reach $450,000 per megawatt, depending on the outcome of negotiations. In fact, he has seen prior deals priced as high as $500,000 to $550,000 per megawatt. However, demand for distressed or less desirable locations hasn't gone away and still draws “lowball” bids, sometimes $100,000–$250,000 per megawatt, from buyers who like the power but discount the market or site quality. So who are these buyers and sellers? According to Nardini, buyers include hyperscalers (large tech companies that provide cloud computing infrastructures), AI firms, and bitcoin miners, while the seller universe is expanding beyond crypto-native players. He has seen dealmaking processes involving old industrial facilities, such as a 160-year-old facility, where the primary attraction is power, even if the market isn’t great. In another case, he said a private seller of a similar type asset drew interest from roughly 25 prospective buyers seeking NDAs, including bitcoin BTC$88,949.46 miners, hyperscalers and AI firms. That dynamic is creating an unusual strategic fork for asset owners. Sell to a hyperscaler or developer, or try to become a developer themselves. Nardini said he’s seeing industrial companies with older, idle, or near-idle facilities that have power consider selling into the AI/HPC and Bitcoin ecosystem. He cited another example involving a private client repurposing older office blocks into modular power capacity, “building 30 megawatt units at a clip," and now looking for additional funding to expand. In at least one negotiation, he said, a tenant was even prepared to prepay rent before completion, an illustration, in his view, of how scarce desirable capacity remains. Looking into 2026, Nardini said the setup still favors risk assets if rates fall, calling it a potentially “risk-on environment,” which will be positive for dealmaking in his industry. He acknowledged he may be “talking his book a little,” but said the operating reality he’s hearing from executives keeps him constructive: the tenants are there, pricing remains strong, and if one customer doesn’t take a site, “someone else will.” His caveat to the positive sentiment is simple: if developers can’t lease what they build, or can’t get the price they need, that would be the moment to worry. For now, he says he isn’t hearing that. “The bones of the business remain intact,” he said. He concluded with a blunt assessment of the sentiment. "The demand for power and AI HPC data center capacity continues unabated. Developers with data center capacity have demand from multiple creditworthy tenants at good rates, so the core economics of business remain intact." Nardini said buyers are still hungry for energy, and sellers are seeing good valuations for their assets. This solidifies his conviction further. “The AI trade is still alive as of Dec. 17, 2025,” he said.

Title: 5 MMO Games We Almost Got (And Why They Were Never Made)
URL: http://comicbook.com/gaming/list/mmos-never-released/
Time Published: 2025-12-23T17:30:00Z

By Brandon Zachary Game development on the most basic of titles is tricky enough, but massively multiplayer online role-playing games are a different beast entirely. MMORPGs have to be a big enough world to justify a player’s lengthy time commitment, while also being entertaining and engaging enough to keep them from migrating to other titles. The biggest MMORPGs (like Blizzard’s World of Warcraft and Grinding Gear Games’ Path of Exile) have massive player bases, and there are other consistent titles in the genre like Star Wars: The Old Republic and DC Universe Online. However, there have been some heartbreaking cancellations over the years that resulted in some promising concepts never making it out of development. Here are some of the most exciting MMORPGs that players never got to dive into. Codenamed “Titan,” the Halo MMORPG was sent to bring Master Chief into the RPG space. Developed by Ensemble Studios, the game was initially inspired by the success of Ultima Online. The concept for a sci-fi-heavy MMORPG became a passion project for the developer. After the success of Halo: Combat Evolved, the sci-fi MMORPG was retrofitted into a Halo title and had a number of functional similarities to the hit Blizzard game. Intended to be a rival to World of Warcraft, Ensemble Studios split attention between this game and the RTS adaptation of the Halo franchise, Halo Wars. Although the game pioneered several concepts that would later be brought to life by other MMORPGs, leadership changes at Microsoft and the inevitable investment it would take time to turn a Halo MMORPG into a money maker resulted in the game being shut down. Amazon’s move into the world of gaming was an ambitious play that didn’t end up landing as well as the company had hoped. This resulted in some serious cuts to Amazon’s gaming teams in October. One of the biggest casualties of this was an open-world MMO game set during the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Developed by Amazon Games Orange County (the same team that produced New World: Aeternum), the game was formally announced in 2023 and described as being in early development. While the game would have benefited from Amazon’s resources and the natural connection to Prime Video’s The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power TV show, the team reportedly had trouble figuring out how to make the game stand out from other fantasy MMORPGs like Standing Stone Games’ The Lord of the Rings Online and World of Warcraft. Amazon Gaming has shut down many of its games as part of its recent layoffs, with reports suggesting that the Lord of the Rings MMORPG was among the games impacted and shut down by the cuts. EverQuest has been one of the most consistent MMORPG franchises in gaming history, launching in 1999 with the first entry in the series and eventually getting sequels like the PS2’s EverQuest Online Adventures and 2004’s EverQuest II. Formally announced in 2012, EverQuest Next was intended to be a fresh take on the material and would have featured the biggest sandbox world developed at the time. Development carried on for several years under the eye of Daybreak Game Company, which has successfully launched several MMORPGs over the years. Although the game was intended to launch on the PlayStation 4 and was even suggested to have some compatibility with the Oculus Rift, plans for the game came to a halt in 2016. According to the game’s development team, the team couldn’t find a way to make the expansive game “fun,” and the title was cancelled. Fans of EverQuest still have the earlier titles, with the most recent expansion launching in December 2025. Announced in 2010, Rockman Online was a collaboration between Capcom and Neowiz Games. Taking place in the distant future of the Mega Man/Mega Man X series, Rockman Online would have brought back the Maverick Virus and required the construction of several duplicate machines modeled after series mainstays X, Zero, Duo, and Cinnamon to combat the hordes of new corrupted robots. The game was in active development for two years, with gameplay trailers even revealing a 2.5D platforming gameplay style that felt consistent with the franchise’s history. Production moved along far enough that trailers and gameplay clips were revealed to the public, showcasing multiple Mega Man characters fighting alongside one another. There was even a promotional contest to let two lucky winners name characters in the game. However, management shifts at Neowiz Games pushed the game to the back burner, and it was formally cancelled in 2013. Stargate Worlds was an ambitious collaboration by Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment and the MGM film studio. The game was announced in 2006 and was set to be directly based on the cult classic series, Stargate SG-1. Game publisher FireSky became involved in 2008, announcing they were committed to helping bring the best game possible to life. However, in 2009, Stargate SG-1 co-creator Brad Wright (who had been brought into the development as a games creative consultant) revealed his doubts that the game would ever see the light of day. Although there were plans for a closed beta version of the game, and members of the press at the time were impressed by the early previews of the game, Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment filed for bankruptcy in 2010.

Share this article US Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF net flows have remained negative since early November, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. The 30-day simple moving average for both asset classes turned negative in early November and has stayed below zero. Glassnode attributed the trend to “a phase of muted participation and partial disengagement from institutional allocators, reinforcing the broader liquidity contraction across the crypto market.” The firm tracks 11 Bitcoin ETFs, including products from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Ark/21 Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, Valkyrie, Invesco/Galaxy, Franklin Templeton, and WisdomTree. Its Ethereum coverage includes nine ETFs from BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, 21 Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Vanguard Exec Likens Bitcoin to ‘Digital Labubu’ Even as Firm Opens ETF Trading Access

Executive John Ameriks emphasized Vanguard’s core view of the crypto sector hasn’t changed, seeing the asset class as highly speculative. Vanguard’s global head of quantitative equity, John Ameriks, said bitcoin still resembles a speculative collectible more than an asset meant to build long-term wealth, comparing it to a “digital Labubu,” the plush toy that has become a popular collectible. Ameriks’ words came during Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth conference in New York on Thursday, where he said bitcoin lacks the income, compounding, and cash-flow traits Vanguard seeks when it evaluates long-term investments. His dismissive stance comes as Vanguard just opened its platform to crypto exchange-traded funds, allowing its 50 million clients access to regulated investment vehicles from rivals like BlackRock and Fidelity. The asset management giant’s begrudging embrace of crypto is a reversal of long-time skepticism towards the entire asset class. For years, Vanguard stood against offering cryptocurrency products to clients, reiterating that it saw digital assets as highly speculative and unaligned with its core investment philosophy. That view, according to Ameriks, apparently hasn’t changed. As a result, Vanguard does not plan to launch its own crypto-focused ETFs. The decision is notable as bitcoin ETFs have become BlackRock’s top revenue source. Still, after Vanguard saw crypto ETFs and funds “have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity,” the firm opened its brokerage platform to these products. Even with that access, Vanguard will not advise clients on whether to buy or sell crypto assets or which tokens to hold, Ameriks said. Ameriks said bitcoin could eventually show non-speculative value in certain conditions, such as high inflation or political instability, but he argued the evidence is still limited. “You’ve still got too short of a history,” he said.

Title: Can Promises Alone Push Tesla to $2T in 2026? Here’s Why Bulls Say Yes

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 2021 Getty Images / Getty Images News via Getty Images Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been unbelievably bullish in the past few months. It was supposed to be game over for Tesla once Musk had a falling out with Trump, but TSLA stock is up nearly 120% after bottoming out that spring. It is now higher than it has ever been. Musk was also “vindicated” by a recent ruling where the justices unanimously ruled to reinstate his 2018 Tesla compensation package. It overturned a 2024 decision that voided the $140 billion deal. You’d expect financials to be better than ever, but that’s not the case either. Net income kept falling, and revenue increased by only 11.57% year-over-year in Q3. This is a very modest increase for a stock trading at 219 times 2026 expected earnings. You’re paying exactly 15 times forward sales, so even top-notch margins would keep this stock at expensive levels. This begs the question: Are promises alone driving the stock? Are investors naive enough to buy into the stock in droves without at least some hard figures to reinforce their conviction? This is the hardest part to figure out, and what better way to find an answer than to ask the bulls themselves? Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes Tesla can reach $2 trillion. This is the same analyst who sees Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) becoming a $1 trillion company, but a large number of investors share his optimism. His rationale is that Tesla is in a “defining moment” due to Robotaxi and robotics. He believes AI and autonomous driving “could be worth nearly $1 trillion” and generate profits on top of Tesla’s core electric vehicle business. You don’t have to take permabull Ives’ justification for the optimism. Bank of America justified its $471 price target due to the Robotaxi and the Optimus robot. Per its own sum-of-the-parts analysis that runs through 2040, the Robotaxi platform alone accounted for 45% of Tesla’s total valuation, with the Optimus humanoid robot at 19%. TSLA stock has surged past that price target. Another long-term Tesla bull, Cathie Wood, believes 90% of Tesla’s enterprise value and earnings will come from the Robotaxi business in 2029. It is important to note, though, that Wood predicted a tenfold increase in TSLA’s price all the way back in early 2023, with the bear case at $1,400. Her justification then was full self-driving technology. All things considered, the bulls have a very mobile (pun unintended) thesis for why they see parabolic gains. If Robotaxis end up failing, Optimus or something else that may come up is very likely to take its place. Even though the numbers are not there, the bulls are putting the money where their mouth is. TSLA stock has continued climbing, and the bears have been proven dead wrong in the past year. Wood’s portfolio has Tesla as its largest holding with a 12.2% weight. In the coming quarters, Musk can start working on the numbers as the “anti-Tesla” sentiment has cooled down. Interest rate cuts will also indirectly raise demand for vehicles as they make car loans more affordable. If this coincides with a drawn-out AI rally that lasts through 2026, TSLA stock will be able to reach $2 trillion and beyond. While it’s true that Musk’s promises can get an even higher price tag in the coming quarters, chasing it is not worth it today. Tesla is highly vulnerable to a slowdown of the AI rally. Optimus’ presumed long-term potential relies mostly on AI’s progress on the software side. The robot’s chassis has been remotely controlled by a human in events. If Tesla figures out a way to make it truly autonomous, the sky is the limit. This is unlikely to happen even a decade out, but bulls will keep paying for the prospect as long as AI progress in general remains swift. If not, the dashed hopes will drag TSLA stock down with it. Then there are the Robotaxis. The potential is surely there, but so is the competition. The Waymo + Uber (NYSE:UBER) fleet is larger and more advanced at the moment. Theoretically, Tesla can still dominate if it could make millions of its FSD-capable cars into a Robotaxi fleet overnight. Paying for TSLA stock as if that has already happened is still not a good idea, at least in my opinion. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © websummit / Flickr Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is one of the top hedge funds today. It has over $100 billion in assets, and the fund has made solid moves despite market uncertainties. Following the steps of billionaires can help you build a portfolio that stands the test of time. However, due diligence is very important. Bridgewater Associates has made several transactions in the third quarter, and it is reflected in the 13F reports. However, the billionaire has played safe with his investments. His top holdings include two tech titans and two ETFs. Here’s why I’d recommend them too. Bridgewater Associates has the highest allocation in the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:IVV), comprising 10.62% of the portfolio.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © websummit / Flickr Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is one of the top hedge funds today. It has over $100 billion in assets, and the fund has made solid moves despite market uncertainties. Following the steps of billionaires can help you build a portfolio that stands the test of time. However, due diligence is very important. Bridgewater Associates has made several transactions in the third quarter, and it is reflected in the 13F reports. However, the billionaire has played safe with his investments. His top holdings include two tech titans and two ETFs. Here’s why I’d recommend them too. Bridgewater Associates has the highest allocation in the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:IVV), comprising 10.62% of the portfolio.

Title: Ethereum is vanishing from exchanges, and the massive wallets absorbing it prove you aren’t the target audience anymore

Exchange balances hit record lows and institutions control 11% of supply, but NFT sales cratered 87% and retail sits out. Is ETH becoming infrastructure without the culture? Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum (ETH) broke its 2021 all-time high in August, brushing $4,945 and a $600 billion market cap, while exchange balances hit record lows. Corporate treasuries and spot ETFs now control nearly 11% of the circulating supply. By every structural metric, ETH should feel like it's having a moment. It doesn't. No Bored Apes are selling for seven figures. No TikTok explainers are going viral. The 2025 ETH rally is real, measurable, and entirely clinical. This is a quiet reallocation by institutions treating Ethereum less like a speculative trade and more like yield-bearing infrastructure. The cultural void raises a sharper question: is ETH transitioning from layer-1 casino to institutional plumbing, and what does price discovery look like when the buyers don't care about hype? The supply story is unambiguous. Only 10.5% of all ETH now sits on centralized exchanges as of Dec. 21, one of the lowest shares since the network launched and down 43% since July, per Coinglass data. Additionally, more than 35.6 million ETH is locked in staking as of Dec. 20. BlackRock’s filing raises questions on slashing risk, custody waterfalls and yield passthrough. We chart three scenarios for fees and liquidity. This isn't speculative hoarding, but rather an operational infrastructure. Nansen's holder composition shows the largest addresses are staking contracts, institutional custodians, and ETF wrappers, not whale wallets. Exchange float is draining, but not into day-trading accounts. It's moving into pipes: layer-2 bridges, restaking protocols, treasury vaults. Corporate balance sheets tell the same story. Treasury data from Dec. 19 estimates that corporate holders plus spot Ethereum ETFs now control 10.72% of the circulating supply. This is divided in 5.63% in corporate hands and 5.09% in ETFs, according to Strategic ETH Reserve data. BitMine has accumulated over 4 million ETH, equivalent to 3.36% of the total supply, and has explicit plans to reach 5%. These aren't venture bets, but strategic positions tied to Ethereum's role in stablecoin settlement and tokenized asset rails. ETF flows confirm the institutional tilt. Year-to-date, ETPs tracking ETH have drawn about $12.7 billion in net inflows, with US spot Ethereum ETFs representing $12.4 billion. The infrastructure is built. The allocators are here. The 2025 research cycle has started treating ETH as yield-bearing infrastructure rather than a levered bet on tokens. Citi's September note setting a $4,300 year-end target is explicit: the driver is demand for Ethereum-based stablecoins and tokenization, not speculative trading. The bank highlights staking yield as a differentiator for corporate portfolios, sketching a bull case to $6,400 if stablecoin adoption evolves on the optimistic trajectory. Binance Research argued that if stablecoin settlement and layer-2 scaling continue on current trends, ETH's valuation logic shifts from “deflationary asset” to “ecological infrastructure asset.” Data from rwa.xyz shows that Ethereum controls $12.5 billion of the tokenized real-world assets (RWA) market, equivalent to 66.6%. Ethereum's growth in RWA tokenization since 2024 has been stellar, rising from $1.5 billion, representing a 735% increase from its current size. Stablecoin usage also skyrocketed. According to data from Artemis, Ethereum recorded $1.6 trillion in monthly stablecoin transaction volume as of Dec. 21 and $172.1 billion in stablecoin supply. Supply growth is 141% compared to the $71.3 billion seen in January 2024. The thesis emerging from these reports is consistent: ETH is increasingly treated like a yield-bearing, rails-of-the-system asset in professional portfolios. It's about needing Ethereum to function as plumbing for tokenized dollars, securities, and derivatives that institutions are already building. NFTs are the clearest cultural contrast. Data from CryptoSlam shows NFT art sales plunging from nearly $16.5 billion in 2021 to just $2.2 billion in 2025, a drop of roughly 87%. LG shut down its Art Lab NFT marketplace, Tennis Australia's Artball collection saw floor prices collapse by around 90%, and CryptoPunks were transferred to a non-profit, with coverage bluntly observing that the “money-making days” are over. Google Trends data shows that crypto-related searches in the US remain well below prior-cycle peaks, rising to 100 only when prices grind higher between July and August. The participation mix confirms the shift. Retail mania has rotated heavily into US single-stock trading rather than altcoins. Ethereum ETP flows swing between huge inflow weeks and very large outflow weeks, more like a tug-of-war between structured products than a one-way retail stampede. The mismatch between accumulation and attention creates a medium-term puzzle. Traditional price discovery depends on a mix of fundamental flows and narrative momentum. Ethereum in 2025 has the former without the latter. ETFs and treasuries provide slow, steady demand. Staking locks up supply, and tokenization brings real-world assets to Ethereum. But the cultural engine that drove 2021, consisting of retail users treating every transaction like a statement, has stalled. This matters because Ethereum's valuation has always been partly reflexive. The network becomes more valuable as more applications build on it, partly because developers expect it to grow in value. That virtuous cycle depends on momentum, not just infrastructure. When corporate buyers treat ETH as a tool to settle tokenized bonds rather than a bet on the future of finance, they stabilize the asset but flatten its narrative arc. The wire shows ETH buying. The data shows supply draining from exchanges. What's missing is the cultural proof that any of this matters to anyone outside the trade. Ethereum may be transitioning from a speculative layer-1 to financial plumbing, and if that's the case, the 2021 feeling might not return. The question is whether the next phase of steady, institutional, infrastructure-driven flows can sustain the valuations that retail mania once underwrote.

Title: Where Will Broadcom (AVGO) Stock Be in 5 Years?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Justin Sullivan / Getty Images Sometimes in discussions about artificial intelligence (AI) hardware providers, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) gets left out of the conversation. Yet, it’s a mistake for technology investors to overlook Broadcom and AVGO stock. Along with the potential for a Broadcom stock split, there may be a value proposition for investors here. In five years, unless there’s a catastrophic event, Broadcom shares could trade much higher than they do today. If that happens, you’ll wish you had gotten in before the rocket ride started. When all is said and done, value investors should open their minds and consider AVGO stock a bargain even if it’s not immediately obvious. At first glance, some investors might not be immediately find Broadcom stock attractive. For one thing, the share price recently pulled back from nearly $415 to $340, representing a scary 18% drawdown. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though, if you’re a value investor looking to hold AVGO stock for five years. Maybe the 18% share-price correction was needed in order to bring Broadcom down to a low valuation. This theory is difficult to support with old-school metrics, however. For example, Broadcom has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 71x to 72x, which doesn’t look like a bargain. Furthermore, Broadcom’s forward annual dividend yield of 0.76% probably won’t impress many income investors. Sometimes a share-price pullback will set the stage for a high dividend yield, but this apparently hasn’t happened with AVGO stock. In order to justify a five-year buy-and-hold with Broadcom stock, the company really needs to demonstrate its growth potential. From a financial standpoint at least, Broadcom definitely checked the right boxes with its fourth-quarter fiscal year 2025 results. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan had every right to brag when he announced the company’s record quarterly revenue of $18 billion, up 28% year over year. Tan further clarified that Broadcom’s revenue growth was “driven primarily by AI semiconductor revenue increasing 74%” year over year. It’s difficult to extrapolate five years out, but clearly Broadcom’s growth trajectory is on a powerful uptrend. If you can believe it, Broadcom’s Q4 FY2025 GAAP-measured net income nearly doubled year over year, increasing 97% to $8.518 billion. Also on a year-over-year basis, Broadcom’s free cash flow (FCF) grew 36% to $7.466 billion while the company’s adjusted EBITDA expanded 34% to $12.218 billion. Given these figures, it’s surprising that Broadcom isn’t a darling of the financial market. So maybe value investors ought to be willing to overlook Broadcom’s seemingly high P/E ratio. Given AVGO stock’s five-year trajectory and the company’s growth pathway, a $500 share price in a couple of years and $800 in five years is entirely possible. Besides, even if the company doesn’t get all of the attention on Wall Street, Broadcom is a power player among AI hardware producers. To cite one example, Broadcom recently introduced the Brocade X8 Directors and Brocade G820 storage network products. The company describes these products as the “industry’s first 128G Fibre Channel platforms designed for today’s mission-critical workloads and enterprise AI applications.” Only time will tell, but these could prove to be major revenue generators as Broadcom expands its array of enterprise AI hardware offerings. Looking ahead, Broadcom anticipates $73 billion worth of AI product backlog over the next year and a half. Deliveries of these products, moreover, should drive 150% year-on-year AI revenue growth for Broadcom in fiscal year 2026. Granted, these are only expectations and not all predictions work out as planned. Ultimately, Broadcom will only succeed and thrive over the next five years if enterprise AI product demand remains robust. The point is that if you see an AI bubble and expect it to burst, then you probably shouldn’t buy and hold Broadcom stock. As the old saying goes, scared money doesn’t make money. However, without an AI hardware market collapse, the runway is clear for AVGO stock to hit $800 in five years. Broadcom knocked it out of the part in Q4 FY2025, and the company’s AI product backlog prediction should boost investors’ confidence. Therefore, it’s fine to keep track of Broadcom’s seemingly high P/E ratio and small dividend, but there’s no need to obsess over these figures. Instead, consider owning AVGO stock after the recent 18% dip and holding your Broadcom shares for five years or longer. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Will XRP Hit $5 in 2026? 5 Catalysts That Could Make It Happen—And 3 Risks That Won’t

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © DUSAN ZIDAR / Shutterstock.com XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) has spent years moving in tight ranges, but 2026 is shaping up as a decisive period. With institutional interest building, new products on the horizon, and macro conditions beginning to shift, investors are asking a sharper question than ever: will XRP hit $5 in 2026? Some believe a clear set of catalysts could finally unlock that level. Others argue that the same risks that held XRP back before still apply. To understand what comes next, it helps to separate what could realistically drive a move for the XRP price to $5 from what could prevent it. Andrey Gorgots / Shutterstock.com XRP reaching $5 in 2026 requires specific drivers working together. Five catalysts are already in motion, and each one addresses a different barrier that has kept the XRP price range-bound. Speculation around a BlackRock-backed XRP ETF sits at the top of the list because of what it represents: scale, credibility, and regulated access. Since mid-November 2025, spot XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in cumulative inflows, led by Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale. Market observers have pointed out that XRP-linked funds appear less sensitive to short-term macro stress, suggesting a different investor base. While BlackRock stated in August 2025 that it has no immediate plans for an XRP ETF, analysts believe regulatory clarity and sustained ETF demand could change that calculus. If BlackRock eventually moves forward, estimates suggest inflows could reach $2 billion or more. That level of capital would reshape demand and strengthen the case for XRP hitting $5. It would also position XRP as the only crypto asset with an ETF tied to a fully regulated token in the U.S. Japan is quietly becoming one of the most important regions in the long-term XRP story. Ripple and SBI Holdings plan to launch RLUSD—Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin—in Japan by Q1 2026 through SBI VC Trade, pending regulatory approval. The project is being built through licensed trust banks and exchanges under Japan’s Payment Services Act. Japan accounts for more than half of Ripple’s global payment volume. When regulated stablecoins become part of domestic and cross-border settlement, XRPL’s role as an infrastructure gains relevance. Banks using RLUSD on the XRP Ledger create real demand for XRP as a bridge currency. This supports the XRP reaching $5 case, even if the impact builds gradually over quarters. Tokenization is where blockchain adoption moves beyond theory. Ripple’s expanded relationship with Archax—a regulated digital securities exchange—reflects this shift. The partnership aims to bring hundreds of millions of dollars in tokenized equities, debt, and funds onto XRPL by mid-2026. Archax operates in a regulated environment and has already shown that tokenized traditional assets can function at scale. XRPL’s fast settlement—transactions clear in 3-5 seconds—and low fees make it suitable for this use case. Traditional securities settlement can take days and cost significantly more. As global consulting firms project tokenized assets reaching trillions of dollars by the end of the decade. If XRPL captures even 5-10% of tokenized asset settlement, the utility demand for XRP multiplies, and this harnesses its case of reaching $5 in 2026. Macro policy remains one of the most important background forces shaping XRP’s upside potential. Expected Federal Reserve rate cuts would lower returns on cash and short-term bonds, historically pushing capital toward risk assets offering growth and liquidity. Large-cap digital assets usually benefit first from this shift, especially those with deep markets and improving regulatory clarity. XRP fits that profile—consistent volume, global recognition, and increasing institutional discussion. Rate cuts don’t cause price rallies by themselves, but they change behavior. Capital becomes more willing to take exposure, and risk tolerance rises across portfolios. In that environment, questions like “will XRP hit $5” move from speculation to portfolio debate as allocation decisions begin to shift. Supply dynamics add another layer to this outlook, and recent on-chain data makes the shift hard to ignore. Exchange-held XRP fell sharply, with 1.35 billion XRP pulled off exchanges in less than two months. Balances dropped from roughly 3.95 billion tokens to about 2.6 billion, with more than 1 billion leaving in just three weeks. This pace suggests a decisive change in behavior. Large withdrawals signal that holders are moving XRP into longer-term storage—cold wallets and institutional custody—rather than keeping it readily available for sale. While this doesn’t guarantee higher prices, it does reduce immediate sell pressure and tightens available liquidity. If demand rises through ETFs, institutional participation, or settlement-related use while supply remains constrained, price movements can accelerate. This is why exchange outflows feature so prominently in discussions about XRP’s upside potential heading into 2026. Tamisclao / Shutterstock.com Even with multiple bullish drivers in place, there are clear risks that could prevent XRP from reaching higher levels. These risks are structural and they explain why the question of XRP hitting $5 still divides investors. The largest risk remains regulation. XRP’s progress over the past year has been closely tied to improving legal clarity and regulatory acceptance following the August 2025 SEC settlement. That progress underpins institutional interest and ETF-related momentum. However, regulatory environments can change quickly. A tougher stance from U.S. regulators, new compliance requirements, or delays in XRP ETF approvals could slow institutional participation. For large investors, certainty matters more than speed, and any sign of reversal would likely pause capital inflows and weaken confidence. Ownership concentration is another important risk. XRP has a history of large holders selling into strength. When price moves higher, these holders often take profits, increasing sell pressure at key resistance levels. This behavior can flatten rallies even when broader sentiment is positive. If distribution accelerates during a breakout attempt, demand from ETFs or retail investors may struggle to absorb the supply. This dynamic has capped previous rallies and remains a real obstacle to XRP reaching the $5 target. The final risk sits outside the crypto market entirely. A global economic slowdown or recession would reduce appetite for risk assets across the board. In such conditions, investors typically rotate into cash, bonds, or defensive assets. Even strong crypto narratives struggle when liquidity tightens. If recession fears dominate in 2026—triggered by banking stress, geopolitical shocks, or persistent inflation—capital that might have flowed into digital assets could stay sidelined. You can have perfect fundamentals, but if the economy contracts, risk assets like XRP suffer. XRP reaching $5 wouldn’t come from a single headline or short burst of momentum. It would require a rare alignment of multiple forces playing out together. ETF inflows would need to remain strong and consistent, institutional adoption would have to translate into real, sustained capital commitment, macro conditions must stay supportive, supply conditions would need to remain tight, and whales would need to hold rather than distribute aggressively into strength. XRP hitting $5 requires all five catalysts to align while the three major risks stay dormant. BlackRock files an ETF, Japan launches RLUSD at scale, tokenization gains traction, the Fed cuts rates, and supply stays locked up—all while regulators stay friendly, whales hold their positions, and the economy avoids recession. It’s a narrow path, but possible. How many of these factors actually align will decide whether XRP hits $5 in 2026 or consolidates below $3 while building for a later run.

Buffett did not offer an in-depth explanation for selling these stocks and largely missed out on the broader AI rally. He said that he does not see many opportunities in the market right now. In other words, he believes the market is overvalued and is okay waiting until it cools off. He can then pounce and buy more on the cheap. Buffett is also due to retire as CEO at the end of this month. Greg Abel will assume his role, and some believe Buffett is building up a cash pile for Abel. Anyhow, let’s take a look at the 6 stocks he dumped in Q3 2025, along with Buffett’s likely motives for doing so. Berkshire Hathaway has been aggressively trimming its AAPL position since Q4 2023. With the exception of Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, Berkshire has sold AAPL shares every single quarter since then. Buffett only had positive things to say about Apple and its CEO, so the issue is unlikely to be Apple itself. It is more likely that he sees the broader market as overvalued and is taking profits. Buffett is sticking to his principle of reducing equity exposure whenever he feels the stock market is overheated. Apple happens to be his largest holding, so it only makes sense that he takes profits here. In Q3, he sold $10.6 billion worth of AAPL stock. Bank of America is another company Warren Buffett has had a long history with. He saved the bank in 2011 with a $5 billion investment as the ripple effects of 2008 weakened it. Back then, he made comments about how he liked the profit-generating abilities of the franchise and wanted to hold that investment for the long term. He has stayed true to that commitment, but his BAC holdings have swelled to the point where it makes sense to start taking profits. He has been selling every single quarter since Q3 2024. He sold $1.92 billion worth of BAC stock in Q3 2025, though his holdings are still worth $29.3 billion. VeriSign is an internet infrastructure business. It has been one of Buffett’s most profitable investments. He started loading up aggressively in late 2012 through mid-2014. Back then, VRSN traded ~$40 per share. He made another timely buy in Q4 2024, where the average closing price was ~$200. The stock ballooned to $266.93, and he almost timed the top by selling $1.2 billion worth of it. This was to keep his ownership below 10%. If his ownership crossed that threshold, it would involve Berkshire with regulatory obligations. Buffett has a long history with this kidney disease treatment company, but he hasn’t added to it since Q4 2014. Shares have been slowly climbing in the past decade, but have lagged the broader market. Recent performance has been quite good, and Buffett has been taking profits since the start of this year. He sold $217 million worth of DVA stock in Q3 2025. D.R. Horton is America’s largest homebuilder. DHR stock makes sense as interest rates are coming down, with many believing homebuilding is set to pick up speed significantly. Buffett, however, ran for the exits. He bought in Q3 2023, and homebuilding stocks went on to do quite well until late 2024. They’ve been quite slow since, and even rate cuts haven’t spurred a considerable rally. He sold $199 million worth of DHI stock in Q3 2025. Again, the sale was timely, with the stock sliding down since. Buffett no longer has any DHI shares in his portfolio. Nucor is a steel producer and recycler. NUE stock has been one of the most interesting names in the past, with sudden, sharp rallies as American steel companies were put under the spotlight multiple times in the past few years. Booming steel prices drove NUE stock to record highs in 2021. Buffett was uninvolved back then, but bought in Q1 2025 and Q2 2025 as the rally cooled. The stock then reversed course, and Buffett is now starting to take profits. He sold 3.1% of his stake in NUE, worth ~$29 million. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

The network’s builders have historically focused on technical accomplishments and an ideal of decentralization so pure, critics say, that they can sometimes lose sight of the bigger economic and political picture. But this year, amidst seismic regulatory developments for the crypto industry, Ethereum has stealthily made huge inroads in arenas it long was perceived to have neglected. From Wall Street board rooms to social media timelines, 2025 was the year Ethereum finally conquered centralized institutions. For nearly half a decade, Wall Street veteran Vivek Raman has attempted to onboard top traditional finance players onto Ethereum. “They all told me to politely leave their offices for four years,” Raman told Decrypt. The executive figured a paradigm shift might come this year, given crypto’s newfound political influence. But even he was blown away by what 2025 reaped for Ethereum at an institutional level. “This year was validation beyond what we would have expected,” Raman said. In January, Raman co-founded Etherealize, an organization dedicated to making Ethereum “the backbone of global finance”. Over the course of this year, he said, centralized institutions have followed three significant trends when it comes to crypto. For one, they all are now “urgently” attempting to expand their businesses onto blockchain networks. Two: They have near-universally embraced Ethereum’s distinctive multi-layer network model as the way to do so. And three—perhaps most crucially—this embrace of Ethereum has come about organically, he claimed. “People have just chosen Ethereum, not because there's a [business development] team, but because it's the right place to do business,” Raman said. The success stories are almost too many to count. Base, the Coinbase-incubated layer-2 network built on Ethereum, has become one of the year's buzziest success stories in Wall Street circles. When financial services mainstay Fidelity began tokenizing assets this spring, it went with Ethereum to get the job done. So did the global banking cooperative SWIFT. And after Robinhood went all-in on offering tokenized stocks this summer, the trading giant opted to create its own layer-2 network on Ethereum. Beyond that, there’s the rest of globe: Upbit in South Korea, Ant Group in China, IHC in Abu Dhabi, Amundi in Europe, and Bailie Gifford in the UK. When those financial institutions—some of the most important in the world—dove headfirst into tokenization projects this year, they all chose Ethereum (generally via layer-2 networks) as the place to do business. Efficiency, automation, reduced counterparty risk, increased access to capital, transparency in some cases, privacy in others—there are many incentives drawing big institutions to crypto. But old school, risk-averse firms tend to move in a pack, and those in finance appear to have collectively chosen Ethereum as the default place to build on-chain this year, following similar moves made in 2024 by market leaders like BlackRock. After years of standing on the sidelines, these firms now feel emboldened to commit to Ethereum chiefly because the crypto industry has been legitimized by the U.S. government, Danny Ryan, an Etherealize co-founder and former Ethereum core developer, told Decrypt. In July, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing a legal framework for issuing and trading stablecoins in the United States. The law had little to do with integrating complex crypto maneuvers into the traditional financial system (a separate, pending crypto market structure bill covers such issues). But the GENIUS Act blessed the general concept of crypto as permissible, or perhaps more accurately, not impermissible, Ryan said. And ever since, the crypto-cautious dam on Wall Street has burst, with or without market structure legislation. “It didn't say, ‘Hey, all the capital markets you know and love are legal to put on a blockchain,’" Ryan said of the GENIUS Act. “It just said, ‘Hey, you can do things legally on blockchains. It's legitimate.’” “After GENIUS, it's almost like the winds are at our back,” Raman said. It’s not just external actors who have come to see Ethereum differently in 2025. Internally, leaders of the Ethereum Foundation have also made huge shifts this year, in an effort to revamp the network’s global image. “There were a lot of unhappy people internally and externally,” James Smith, the Ethereum Foundation’s head of ecosystem, told Decrypt of the nonprofit’s previous woes. For years, even Ethereum’s advocates complained that the network’s foundation had become mired in an isolated, holier-than-thou “ivory tower” approach—one that turned off key centralized institutions and small-scale crypto founders alike. Smith’s job this year has been to completely reinvent how the Ethereum Foundation engages with the rest of the world. “We’ve become much more intentional about how we engage with institutions in 2025,” he said. “We now have teams whose job is to help serious builders and enterprises plug into Ethereum.” Take, for instance, a new initiative at the Foundation to host one-day conferences focused on appealing to big business. One upcoming event will explain staking to corporate firms in Zurich. Another, in New York, will showcase the benefits of Ethereum’s privacy features to enterprise players. While such outreach might sound like a no-brainer, Smith says these efforts represent a “180 [degree] sea change” in the Ethereum Foundation’s approach. “This is a really big moment for Ethereum,” he said, “which is why this is really needed.” One growing sector that has become increasingly central to Ethereum this year—and thus to the Ethereum Foundation—has been artificial intelligence. As the AI agent economy takes off, Ethereum's developers are betting that bots will eventually become the network’s core user base. This fall, the Foundation launched a full-time team dedicated to AI—which is rolling out collaborations with tech giants including Google. Such alliances might seem counterintuitive for a network that has long pitched itself as a democratic alternative to the hyper-centralized power structures of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. But Davide Crapis, the head of Ethereum’s AI team, doesn’t see the network’s growing popularity among tech and financial elites as a problem. On the contrary, he sees it as an inevitable outcome of the network’s rise to dominance. “The focus needs to be on building the best decentralized technology we can offer,” Crapis said. “When they see the value, they will come.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

In July 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) released the 23rd Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) for adults and the 9th Model List of EML for children. These lists serve as global references for essential medicines that should be universally available, accessible, and affordable. This editorial explores recent updates to the WHO EML lists, with a particular focus on medicines addressing neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). We discuss the persistent barriers to equitable access, including economic, regulatory, and logistical challenges; highlight global initiatives aimed at improving accessibility; and propose strategies to bridge the gap in essential medicine access. We emphasize the need for international collaboration, increased funding for research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, and global health initiatives to support the development of novel treatments for NTDs, and innovative distribution approaches to ensure these medications reach underserved populations.

Funding: The authors received no specific funding for this work. Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Essential medicines are chosen according to a population’s health priorities. Selection is made based on disease prevalence, evidence for efficacy and safety, and cost-effectiveness—criteria established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and reaffirmed in 2024 [1,2]. These same criteria were applied to the 23rd Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) in 2023, which this editorial examines. Since its first publication in 1977, the EML has guided national medicine policies and improved the availability of life-saving medicines to all who need them [3], yet around 2 billion people globally still lack access to essential medicines, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [1–4]. Recent analyses confirm that affordability challenges remain pressing even in 2025, with essential generics still unaffordable for many households [5]. Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are ancient illnesses of poverty that impose a devastating human, social, and economic burden on over 1 billion people annually [2], primarily in tropical and subtropical regions among vulnerable, marginalized populations. Over 90% of NTDs affect LMICs, thriving in environments marked by inadequate sanitation and weak healthcare infrastructure [6]. NTDs include, but are not limited to, lymphatic filariasis, trachoma, onchocerciasis, leishmaniasis, and schistosomiasis. Despite their significant impact, NTDs remain underfunded in both research and pharmaceutical industry investments compared to other global diseases. Although NTDs represented nearly 20% of the infectious disease burden in 2022, they still accounted for less than 0.5% of global health Research and Development (R&D) funding [7]. The 23rd Model List of Essential Medicines of the WHO (2023) is significant for its increased emphasis on infectious diseases, antimicrobial stewardship, and the equitable medicine distribution. Nevertheless, the primary obstacles to accessing essential medicines in the LMICs remain. This editorial will highlight some of these challenges and illustrate how real-world evidence can be used to address them in the context of policymaking. Although malaria is not classified by the WHO as a NTD [8], it disproportionately affects underserved and vulnerable populations in many LMICs and faces similar barriers to equitable medicine access. Therefore, in this editorial, malaria is included in certain sections as a comparative example to highlight overlapping challenges and potential shared solutions. The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) was first introduced in 1977 to assist countries in identifying those essential and cost-effective medicines that should be made available to the population [1]. The list has become a global reference. Updated every two years, the list now informs national essential medicine policies in more than 110 countries [3]. The WHO EML criteria for selecting medicines are: The WHO EML is further divided into two lists: By serving as a global reference, the EML guides procurement, supply chain planning, and policymaking at the national level [1]. It also plays a role in supporting universal health coverage by identifying treatments that should be accessible, affordable, and available to all populations [4]. The 55 new medicines were recommended for inclusion in the 23rd WHO Model List (2023), and 9 existing drugs had their indications expanded. This update focuses on infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and affordability [1]. The 2023 WHO EML includes several additions and revisions that directly impact the prevention and treatment of NTDs. Primarily, the inclusion of pediatric formulations for leishmaniasis and schistosomiasis addresses long-standing gaps in child-appropriate dosing and administration, a key barrier in endemic regions [1,8]. Updated recommendations for antiparasitic medicines enhance treatment efficacy and may help mitigate resistance development [1]. Although malaria is not classified as an NTD, the addition of newer artemisinin-based combination therapies offers lessons in scaling up access to essential medicines for other diseases affecting neglected populations [8]. These updates, while important, highlight remaining gaps; for example, the absence of certain NTD treatments from the core list, limited guidance on affordable procurement mechanisms for LMICs, and the need for stronger links between the EML and national procurement systems [1,9]. The 2023 updates are consistent with the WHO’s efforts to address issues of equity in access to medicines on a global level. However, policy changes and more funding are required for real-world adoption. More than one billion people are affected by NTDs, mainly in Africa, South Asia, and Latin America [2]. These diseases hold and maintain people in the poverty cycle through long-term health impairment, disability, and reduced economic productivity. Some examples are: However, there has been less investment in research and development for NTDs than for diseases that are more common in high-income countries, resulting in the treatment gap and slow development of new treatments [6]. Approximately 2 billion people, especially in LMICs, are still faced with great challenges in obtaining the essential medicines as data shows that over 50% of public health facilities in LMICs experience regular stock-outs [10]. These barriers are a result of economic factors, policy barriers, weak health systems, and pharmaceutical industry factors [4,11]. Despite persisting challenges, global access to essential medicines did not stop improving. WHO reports that global access to essential medicines rose from 50% in 2015 to 65% in 2022 [1]. The upward trend in access demonstrates successful worldwide initiatives, but LMICs continue to face substantial access challenges. The high cost and low health care financing in LMICs is a major factor that limits the access to essential medicines for NTDs. The inability of most national health systems to afford essential medicines has led to stockouts or mimicking donor-dependent programmes [12–15]. Recent WHO reporting and 2025 analyses reaffirm that affordability gaps persist despite progress [5]. Access to medicines in LMICs is frequently hindered by regulatory and logistical barriers. Lengthy drug approval processes delay market entry, while weak procurement and distribution systems contribute to recurring stock-outs of essential medicines. Inadequate quality control and limited regulatory oversight also increase the prevalence of counterfeit or substandard products. Together, these challenges create systemic barriers that prevent timely and equitable access to essential medicines in LMICs [9,16,17]. The lack of profits in the market for NTDs removes incentives for pharmaceutical companies to conduct research and development of new treatments. This market failure can be addressed by public–private partnerships (PPPs), subsidies, and advance market commitments that reduce the financial risks and ensure demand [10]. Funding, tax incentives, and volume guarantees are some of the mechanisms that provide funding and make NTD treatments more attractive to pharmaceutical investors [18,19]. Uncertainty of demand discourages pharmaceutical companies from investing in NTD treatments. Without predictable markets, R&D for low-profit diseases remains unattractive. The financing tool known as Advanced Purchase Commitments (APCs) helps minimize financial risks that come from developing treatments for NTDs. The guaranteed market through APCs gives pharmaceutical companies the necessary certainty to conduct R&D for diseases that generate limited profits. The Global Fund together with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) has implemented APCs to promote vaccine development for malaria and rotavirus while similar models should be used for NTDs [10]. Similar models, if applied to NTDs, could help overcome this barrier and stimulate innovation [18,19] Pricing remains a fundamental barrier to equitable access for NTD medicines. Pharmaceutical companies implement tiered pricing structures which enable them to establish varying medication costs based on the income level of each purchasing nation. While the HIV/AIDS sector demonstrates successful implementation of this pricing model through antiretroviral drugs that maintain affordability for low-income nations, NTD medicines have not benefited from similar arrangements. The absence of transparent fair pricing model and mechanisms creates a barrier for LMICs that must fund NTD programs largely without donor subsidies. Without adaptation of tiered pricing to NTD medicines, affordability remains a critical obstacle to equitable access [5,12–14] Pharmaceutical companies often lack financial incentives to pursue R&D for NTDs, as these conditions primarily affect low-income populations with limited market potential. Tax credits serve as incentives that can motivate pharmaceutical companies to invest in NTD drug development. Governments could provide tax reductions to pharmaceutical companies that dedicate specific parts of their R&D funding to neglected diseases. This approach would help ease the financial burden on companies while enhancing their interest in developing treatments for NTDs. A relevant example is the Orphan Drug Tax Credit in the United States, which successfully stimulated investment in therapies for rare diseases by reducing the effective cost of development [12]. Analyses of the neglected disease R&D landscape highlight persistent financing gaps and underscore the need for targeted incentives to overcome the innovation deficit [18,19]. More recently, frameworks such as the UBC Global Access Principles have demonstrated how aligning innovation incentives with equitable access goals can further ensure that new medicines benefit populations in LMICs [20]. Adapting such tax-based incentives for NTDs could help fill critical innovation gaps and align private sector efforts with public health needs. NTDs are a subset of infectious diseases that account for 19% of global disease burden, yet they have obtained less than 0.5% of global health funding and development funding during the last decade—far less than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, or malaria [4,7]. WHO’s initiatives and rising use of real-world evidence attempt to address these deficiencies by providing new approaches to enhance the availability, affordability, and distribution of these potentially life-saving drugs. Notwithstanding these efforts and the increasing momentum in the global fight against NTDs by international health organizations, governments, pharmaceutical companies, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the challenge of equitable access to essential medicines persists. WHO is central in setting up global standards as well as frameworks for action to combat NTDs. Accelerating programmatic action, increasing cross-sectoral collaboration, and strengthening country ownership are the three key strategic pillars of the WHO’s activities in this regard based on the Global Strategy for Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases (2021–2030) [21]. Some of the components are: In countries with high prevalence of certain diseases including lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and schistosomiasis, the World Health Organization has recommended preventive chemotherapy and has initiated Mass Drug Administration (MDA) campaigns. In this regard, the 2021 MDA campaign covered more than 800 million people in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [1] with the assistance of the WHO. The WHO works with organizations like the Global Drug Facility and the Medicines Patent Pool to ensure the availability and affordability of essential medicines that include antimalarials, antiparasitic, and tuberculosis drugs [22]. By voluntary licensing agreements, generic competition, and pooled procurement mechanisms, these partnerships have brought down prices and improved access to medicine in LMICs. For instance, licensing of intellectual property has helped in the affordable procurement of essential medicines in LMICs, resulting in reduced costs and increased treatment coverage [23]. Other global health organizations, including Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), Gavi, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, have also been involved in financing and delivering essential medicines to WHO. DNDi has provided affordable treatments for leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness, and Chagas disease and more than 2.4 million people have benefited from the life-saving drugs [7]. Especially, the Gates Foundation has made contributions towards vaccine development Global health R&D funding and large-scale disease eradication including malaria and NTDs initiatives. New antibacterial agents and artemisinin-based combination therapies for malaria were added to the 2023 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and WHO continued to manifest concern towards antimicrobial stewardship [1]. These initiatives are essential but require further global investment and sustainable funding mechanisms to ensure long-term success. Recent drug approvals have focused on NTDs [24] and AMR [25]. For example, Oral Amphotericin B, which has been developed under UBC’s Global Access Principles, has been listed as a WHO priority medicine for visceral leishmaniasis owing to its cost-effectiveness, thermal stability, and safety in the LMICs [26]. Furthermore, Hancock Lab’s immunomodulatory peptides are effective in combating bacterial, viral, and fungal infections thus supporting WHO’s AMR strategy [26]. WHO functions as the primary organization that develops global strategies to combat NTDs. The effectiveness of these strategies depends heavily on how countries execute them. The National Strategic Plan for malaria elimination in India has achieved a substantial reduction in transmission by using MDA campaigns and enhancing diagnostic testing capabilities [27]. The WHO supports Uganda’s MDA program for river blindness, which has effectively decreased the disease prevalence in affected areas [21]. Brazil implemented WHO-recommended Chagas disease control measures for diagnosis treatment and vector control, which led to a decrease in new infections [15]. The WHO collaborated with Senegal to achieve near-eradication of guinea worm disease, which serves as an exemplary model for NTD control [28]. Here, we identify and highlight key policy, financial, and technological innovations that fit into global health strategies and have been endorsed by WHO [21], DNDi [29], Gavi [30], and other international organizations that can help achieve the vision of increasing access to essential medicines for NTDs. In support of and advocacy for these approaches, and consistent with the mission of NGDI, we stress the importance of more partnerships and implementation efforts. Emphasizing the development of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing in LMICs is to address dependence on imported medicines and increase the affordability of the former. WHO recommends that countries should: While existing PPPs have played a role in NTD drug donations, expanding these collaborations requires additional measures: WHO’s 2023 Essential Medicines List has been updated to address global health needs in 2025, but significant barriers still hinder equitable access to essential medicines for NTDs. To overcome these challenges, we need stronger global and national policy interventions, more funding for R&D, and technology-based solutions. Through improved cooperation and coordination between governments, pharmaceutical companies, and international health organizations, the global health community can enhance availability of essential medicines and work towards the eradication of NTDs.

Stock futures are little changed Tuesday morning after three consecutive sessions of solid gains for major indexes; gold and silver are sustaining their rally, with prices of the precious metals hitting record highs for the second day in a row; a handful of economic indicators are due today, including reports on economic growth and consumer confidence; Novo Nordisk stock is surging after the FDA approved a pill version of its popular weight loss drug Wegovy; and shipmaker Huntington Ingalls Industries stock is surging following news that the Trump administration wants to build new battleships. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a muted open this morning as the market looks to extend a rally that has lifted major indexes back near record highs. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were down fractionally in recent trading, after posting gains Monday for the third straight session. The Dow enters Tuesday's session 0.7% away from a new closing high, while the S&P 500 is just 0.3% away from its high. Gold futures hit fresh all-time highs, surging above $4,500 an ounce, while WTI crude oil futures ticked higher to $58.05 per barrel and were trading at a two-week high. Bitcoin was at $87,800 recently, after briefly rising above $90,000 on Monday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of consumer loans, slipped to 4.15% from 4.17% late yesterday. Precious metals are extending a rally that has sent gold and silver prices to all-time highs. Gold futures were up 1.2% at near $4,520 an ounce recently, while silver futures rose 1.6% to $69.70, with each trading at record levels for the second straight day. Gold and silver have hit a series of record highs this year amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates. A weakening U.S. dollar and geopolitical uncertainty have also contributed to the gains, as investors have sought out assets that are perceived as safe havens. The price of gold has risen 70% year-to-date, while silver has more than doubled. A slew of economic data is set to be released Tuesday, with a mix of reports that were delayed by the government shutdown and more-current numbers. The report on third-quarter gross domestic product, originally due in October, is due at at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect the GDP report to show that the economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.2%, down from 3.8% in the second quarter but above the average over the last four years of 2.6%. Also due out Tuesday is the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey for December, which will show how Americans felt about the economy heading into the busy holiday shopping season. Durable goods orders for October, another shutdown-delayed report, and a Federal Reserve report on industrial production in November are also both expected today. Shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) are jumping Tuesday after the Danish drugmaker said it has received Food and Drug Administration approval for an oral version of its popular GLP-1 drug Wegovy. Late Monday, the company said the pill version of Wegovy, which caused patients lose about 16.6% of their body weight on average during a clinical trial, will launch in January in the U.S. The weight loss drug industry has seen Novo rival Eli Lilly (LLY) take the lead in sales growth with its Mounjaro and Zepbound, which proved to be more effective in causing weight loss. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have each been racing to get pill versions of the drugs approved, as the companies believe a wider range of people would be open to taking a pill than getting injections. Novo Nordisk's U.S.-listed shares were up 8% in recent premarket trading, while Eli Lilly was down 1%. Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) stock is rising ahead of the opening bell after the Trump administration said that it wants to build new battleships. Navy Secretary John Phelan said Friday that the new ship will be based on a previous Huntington Ingalls design, and that the first ships are expected to be completed by 2028. The company said Friday that it has been given the contract to design and manufacture the new ship. President Trump said Monday that the first ship will be called the USS Defiant as part of his effort to revamp the Navy's fleet of ships into a so-called "Golden Fleet," The Wall Street Journal reported. Huntington Ingalls shares were up 4% in premarket trading, following gains of 5% on Monday and 4% on Friday, each day ending at a record high.

Title: Are altcoins coming back? Why 'Bitcoin season' has staying power in 2026
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/are-altcoins-coming-back-why-bitcoin-season-has-staying-power-in-2026
Time Published: 2025-12-23T12:15:00Z
Full Content:
Crypto traders and several metrics suggest that an altcoin season is nowhere to be seen as institutions help Bitcoin strengthen its grip on the market. Cointelegraph in your social feed Most altcoins are currently displaying bearish patterns that suggest “altcoin season” is not coming, according to numerous analysts, as Bitcoin dominance begins to rise again. Key takeaways: The Supertrend indicator flashes “sell,” which previously led to a 66% drop in the altcoin total market cap. Rising BTC dominance and a low altcoin season index show no signs of reversal. The ongoing sell-off in altcoins is reflected by the correction in TOTAL2, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin (BTC), that began on Oct. 10. Data from TradingView shows that TOTAL2 has decreased by 32% to $1.19 trillion in December from its all-time high of $1.77 trillion reached on Oct. 10. This drop has seen TOTAL2 lose above key support levels, including the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) currently at $1.3 trillion, as shown in the chart below. Related: Crypto altseason unlikely in 2026 as ‘blue-chip survivors’ to win out: Analyst The SuperTrend indicator also flashed a bearish signal when it reversed from red to green and moved above the price in mid-November. This indicator overlays the chart while tracking TOTAL2’s trend, like the moving averages. It incorporates the average true range in its calculations, which helps traders identify market trends. Previous confirmations from these two indicators were followed by 85.5% and 66% drawdowns during the 2018 and 2022 bear markets, as shown in the chart below. Altcoins are still stuck in the downtrend as TOTAL2 consolidates within an ascending triangle. “Altcoin market cap is coiling into a brutal downtrend,” Merlijn The Trader wrote in an X post analysis. Support at $1.15 trillion is holding for now, but “if this triangle breaks, we could see a -30% flush” to $830 billion, the analyst wrote, adding that the “altseason is not coming” until the resistance at $1.68 trillion is broken. “Alt season will never occur again,” wrote CryptoDaddi in a recent post on X, adding that going forward, money will be concentrated into a select few altcoins. Bitcoin's (BTC) grip on the cryptocurrency market has tightened in 2025, leaving little room for altcoins to outperform. After pushing past 65% in June, Bitcoin dominance, a metric measuring Bitcoin’s market share relative to the overall crypto market, dropped to 57% in September. Since then, the metric has been on an upward trend, recording higher highs and higher lows, as shown in the chart below. At the time of publication, BTC dominance is at 59.27%, indicating that it is still Bitcoin season. This metric has not dropped below 50% since September 2023, which has previously marked the start of the altseason. This is a structural shift driven by institutional adoption that came after the approval and success of Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted billions from traditional finance. Institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity prioritize Bitcoin for its adoption, relative stability and regulatory clarity, viewing altcoins as riskier and less liquid. It’s not just aggressive buying by Strategy either. BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF attracted over $25 billion in inflows in 2025, reinforcing the preference corporate buyers have for BTC over altcoins. Bitcoin dominance is printing a higher low, and money is rotating back into BTC, not alts,” said CyrilXBT in an X post, adding: Meanwhile, key indicators the crypto industry uses to determine an incoming altcoin season suggest it’s still nowhere in sight. According to Capriole Investments’ Altcoin Speculation Index, only 21% of the top altcoins have outperformed BTC during the last three-month period, suggesting capitulation among altcoin holders. Additionally, the Crypto Market Breadth, a measure of market strength, reveals that only 8% of all altcoins are trading above their 50-day moving average, suggesting that the altcoin market is extremely weak. Similarly, CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index, which measures the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin’s performance over the past 90 days, is reading a score of 18 out of 100, leaning toward a more Bitcoin-dominated market, referring to it as “Bitcoin Season.” Altcoin season is when the percentage is above 75%. “CMC Altcoin Season Index is at a record low,” said altcoin trader Money Ape in an analysis on X, adding: As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin has outperformed most other cryptocurrency sectors in recent months, indicating that capital and investment continue to favor Bitcoin.

Title: Paramount's new offer for Warner Bros 'not sufficient'
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1223/1550321-paramounts-new-offer-for-warner-bros-not-sufficient/

Paramount Skydance's latest offer to buy Warner Bros Discovery still is not good enough for prominent shareholder Harris Oakmark, the investor has told Reuters. Warner Bros' fifth largest shareholder, owning 96 million shares or about 4% of shares as of the end of September, said it would hold out for more from the Ellison family-controlled Paramount. "The changes in Paramount's new offer were necessary, but not sufficient," Harris Oakmark portfolio manager and Director of US Research Alex Fitch said in an email to Reuters. "We see the two deals as a toss-up, and there is a cost to changing paths. If Paramount is serious about winning, they’re going to need to provide a greater incentive," he added. Paramount yesterday amended its $108.4 billion hostile bid for the storied Hollywood studio to bolster its financing. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, whose son David owns Paramount, is now personally guaranteeing $40.4 billion of the bid to secure Warner Bros, which owns HBO Max and controls the Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and Superman franchises. Questions about the financing, much of which was held in a revocable trust, had some Warner Bros investors unsure whether they would accept the offer. Paramount also increased the fee it will pay to $5.8 billion from $5 billion if regulators do not approve the deal, to match a competing offer from Netflix, although it did not raise its $30-a-share bid. Warner Bros investors now have until January 21, extended from January 8, to accept or reject the so-called tender offer. The board of Warner Bros unanimously recommended on Wednesday that shareholders reject Paramount's earlier bid in favor of Netflix's offer, saying the financing didn't provide a "full backstop." Even though Netflix's cash offer of $23.25 a share is lower, the board said its bid was superior because the financing was more secure and it includes $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock as well as whatever Warner Bros can get when it spins out Discovery Global as part of the deal. The bidding war speaks to the quality of Warner Bros assets, said Yussef Gheriani, chief investment officer of Chicago investment firm IHT Wealth Management, which owns 16,000 shares of Warner Bros, 6,500 shares of Netflix and 60,000 of Paramount. "It’s really rare to get an opportunity to add top shelf media assets to your portfolio," he said, adding that he'll likely follow the board's advice on the sale. "They know the business inside out and have a better grasp of the nuances associated with the deal than we do." Investor Thomas Poehling, who owns 484,000 shares of Warner Bros and 639,000 of Paramount, said he will likely take the revised offer if Netflix does not counter because Paramount has a better chance of winning approval from regulators. Ellison's guarantee "adds a lot of stability to that offer and that removes a lot of the financing uncertainty," he said. Gheriani and Poehling are not the only investors to hold shares in the rival movie studios. Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock are Warner Bros' three largest shareholders, controlling at least 22% of the company between them. All three are also among the top ten investors in Paramount and Netflix. Source: Reuters © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Walmart Worship

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Journalists adore the CEO of the world’s largest retailer. All hail Doug McMillon. Since his announcement in mid-November that he plans to retire early next year as the chief executive of Walmart, McMillon has been basking in tributes. During his 12-year reign atop the world’s largest retailer, Walmart’s annual revenue has increased by nearly $200 billion, to $681 billion. Its stock price has risen more than 300 percent, handily outperforming the S&P 500. And its market capitalization has surpassed $900 million. What those numbers conceal, however, is Walmart’s contribution to the nation’s stark economic divide. And the press has blithely ignored it. “Walmart’s chief executive, Doug McMillon, will step down on Jan. 31,” The New York Times bullishly observed, “completing a 12-year run that moved the company from a staid brick-and-mortar retailer to a formidable challenger to Amazon, making the big-box store the envy of many in the retail industry.” McMillon “leaves Walmart in a strong position after years of work repositioning it as a formidable digital player and more competitive employer.” “I can’t overstate how difficult it is to take a company with such a strong legacy and make it competitive in today’s environment, given the pace of change,” Joanna Starek, an adviser to chief executives, told the Times. In an effort to improve its relationship with its 2.1 million workers worldwide, the paper went on, Walmart under McMillon “has boosted wages as it sought to compete for talented employees, raising both its base salary for US store managers and starting hourly wages for its store workers.” The company “has also started to win over a new type of customer who may go to its website for delivery of not just low-priced clothing, home goods and groceries but also items like the $4,000 Louis Vuitton bags it now sells.” Some pertinent details were missing from the Times account. While wages at Walmart have increased under McMillon—from an average of $12 an hour in 2015—they are still very low. The average hourly rate of a “field associate” (as Walmart calls its cashiers, stockers, and other hands-on workers) is just over $18, which works out to about $36,000 a year—far below a living wage in most of the country. In 2023, Walmart adopted a new wage structure under which most new employees would receive the lowest possible wage for the store hiring them—as little as $14 in some regions. Walmart did expand other benefits, including parental leave, job training, and free college and technical education. It did so not out of any burst of benevolence but rather a need to reduce turnover, which was proving costly. Even with the wage increase, Walmart pays less than other retailers, including Costco (where starting clerks earn $20 to $21 an hour and top-tier ones $32) and Target. In surveys of worker satisfaction, Walmart significantly lags both those retailers. McMillon’s compensation for the year ending February 1, meanwhile, totaled around $27.4 million ($1.5 million in base salary plus stock awards and bonuses). Walmart’s top six executives received a combined compensation of about $100 million. In addition, McMillon owns more than 4 million shares of Walmart stock, worth about $500 million. In the view of The Wall Street Journal, McMillon was worth every penny. “Why CEOs Get Paid So Much,” ran the headline over an editorial extolling his tenure. It cited McMillon’s expansion of Walmart’s e-commerce business, his integration of AI into store management, and his adept managing of Trump’s tariffs. In addition to the spurt in the company’s stock, the Journal observed, Walmart “has increased wages and benefits” for its workers. Noting that big business today is a political target on the left and the right, it urged readers to “compare the wealth created over the last decade by Walmart and the performance of the federal government, and weep for the feds.” While Walmart’s success wasn’t the result of McMillon alone, “its profits have allowed hundreds of thousands of Americans to buy homes, pay tuition, and save for a comfortable retirement. The Gen Z socialists now rising in politics won’t admit it, but they are living off the prosperity created by wealth creators like Walmart’s CEO.” That last comment seems as clueless as it is snide. However, much today’s young progressives might have benefited from a rising stock market, they know how unevenly those benefits have been distributed. About 40 percent of Americans own no stock, and among those who do, the holdings are sharply skewed. The top 10 percent of the population owns more than 90 percent of all stock, while the bottom 50 percent owns but one percent. Not many of them can afford the $4,000 Louis Vuitton bags Walmart is now selling. The Waltons can. The descendants of Sam Walton, Walmart’s founder, the Walmart family is the richest in not just the United States but the world. Walton’s children and grandchildren control about 45 percent of the company’s stock and together are worth $450 billion. Sam’s three children—Jim, Rob, and Alice—are each worth more than $100 billion and rank among the top 20 on Forbes’s list of the 400 richest Americans. Alice is the world’s richest woman. This is shareholder-driven capitalism at its most grotesque. And here’s the fundamental fact: The wealth of the Waltons is directly related to the struggles of Walmart workers. By keeping labor costs down, the company can keep its earnings per share up, and that boosts its stock price. Over the last half-century, executives and shareholders have siphoned off an ever-larger share of national income from retail clerks, forklift operators, and delivery drivers. Whatever raises manual workers at Walmart and other companies have received, their earnings still do not support a middle-class life, fueling frustration with capitalism, fascination with socialism, and a fragmenting of society. On December 9, Doug McMillon was in New York to ring Nasdaq’s opening bell. He was celebrating Walmart’s move to that exchange after more than 40 years on the New York Stock Exchange. Joining the tech-heavy Nasdaq was part of its rebranding as a company committed “to innovation and growth as a people-led, tech-powered omnichannel retailer,” as he clunkily put it. That same morning, McMillon appeared on Squawk Box, the morning financial talk show on CNBC, and—even by the welcoming standards of that show—he was treated with reverence. “We’ve known each other for a long time,” said cohost Andrew Ross Sorkin. “How long have you been thinking of leaving?” “Are you going to write a book?” asked fellow host Joe Kernen. Kernen noted that the company was raising wages. “Our associates are doing well,” McMillon said. “And managers do well,” put in the third host, Becky Quick. “Does the Walmart employee think the system is working?” The Nation Greg Grandin Eric Ross Dave Zirin “People can become managers,” McMillon said. (Walmart in the United States has 4,600 managers—one for each store—which means that about a million and a half employees do not become one.) Mentioning Sam Walton, Kernen said that “it’s a marvel what he did for the American dream.” “We have to keep it going,” said McMillon. “You’ve been a phenomenal leader,” said Quick, “not just at the company but for American values.” “You guys have helped us, educating us,” McMillon said. Not so much the American people. In the coverage of McMillon’s retirement, the perspective of labor was almost completely absent. Journalistic accounts should come with a warning label: No workers were interviewed for this story. In this time of unrelenting, often unprecedented cruelty and lawlessness, I’m grateful for Nation readers like you. So many of you have taken to the streets, organized in your neighborhood and with your union, and showed up at the ballot box to vote for progressive candidates. You’re proving that it is possible—to paraphrase the legendary Patti Smith—to redeem the work of the fools running our government. And as we head into 2026, I promise that The Nation will fight like never before for justice, humanity, and dignity in these United States. At a time when most news organizations are either cutting budgets or cozying up to Trump by bringing in right-wing propagandists, The Nation’s writers, editors, copy editors, fact-checkers, and illustrators confront head-on the administration’s deadly abuses of power, blatant corruption, and deconstruction of both government and civil society. We couldn’t do this crucial work without you. Through the end of the year, a generous donor is matching all donations to The Nation’s independent journalism up to $75,000. But the end of the year is now only days away. Time is running out to have your gift doubled. Don’t wait—donate now to ensure that our newsroom has the full $150,000 to start the new year. Another world really is possible. Together, we can and will win it!

Title: 7 Rising Stars who took Wall Street by storm after starting their careers in sports, science, and engineering

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Most people imagine Wall Street careers beginning in familiar ways: internships at major banks, economics coursework, and early exposure to markets. But some of the young professionals on Business Insider's 2025 Rising Stars of Wall Street list started out somewhere entirely different, long before entering finance. One hoped to be a professional football player. Another was a collegiate golf champion with a goal of playing on all seven continents. A third conducted anthropology fieldwork in Sierra Leone. And another began in a chemistry lab before deciding research wasn't the right fit. We're looking back at this year's cohort, focusing on those whose formative professional years were spent far from trading floors and deal teams. Today, this group has gone on to find success across a spectrum of industry niches from investment banking and private equity to hedge funds and quantitative investing. Below, we're showcasing seven Rising Stars who switched careers, and how those beginnings helped steer their professional climb at firms like BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and more. Their backgrounds are organized alphabetically by their last name. Lamar Cardinez, Blue Owl Before he ever worked in finance, Cardinez thought he'd play professional football. When that didn't happen, he found a way to remain close to the action — interning at Madison Square Garden, joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee, and completing the NFL's rotational program across media, business development, and strategy. He thought he'd stay there and ascend the ranks. But he decided on a different path that seemed to align more with his interests: finance. After earning his MBA and working in investment banking, he joined Blue Owl's HomeCourt Partners, a fund established with the NBA to buy minority stakes in teams. Cardinez has since worked on multiple franchise deals, including the Phoenix Suns' $4 billion sale and a 2024 transaction involving the Minnesota Timberwolves. Catherine Kress, BlackRock Kress' path to high finance began in academic research, studying anthropology and psychology at Notre Dame and conducting fieldwork in Sierra Leone before pursuing graduate work on Angola's energy sector at the University of Oxford. She later worked at political research and consultancy firm, Eurasia Group, training investors to integrate geopolitical risk into decision-making. Kress came to BlackRock first as an advisor to Tom Donilon, the former US national security advisor, a post she called a "dream job." She helped Donilon elevate the firm's geopolitics function into a permanent part of the BlackRock Investment Institute. But she didn't stop there. This year, Kress was named the chief of staff to Larry Fink, the firm's powerful CEO. She told Business Insider that this new job was the "culmination" of her career, offering "unparalleled exposure" to global policymakers and business leaders. Jack Levendoski, JPMorgan Chase Levendoski grew up all over the world — from Louisiana to London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia — before beginning his career as a facilities engineering project manager at Chevron. In that role, he supported offshore oil and gas work in the Gulf of Mexico. Levendoski later moved into investment banking and is now an executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, advising on high-profile technology and software transactions. Josef Menasche, Goldman Sachs Menasche admits he didn't always feel like a natural fit for the finance industry — he didn't grow up in a household of bankers, he said, and he studied chemistry and math at Cambridge. But after trying academic research, he found the lab's pace too slow. That realization led him to roles that blended analytical work with more day-to-day momentum, eventually steering him into secondaries. Today, Menasche is a managing director and global cohead of Goldman Sachs' secondaries advisory group, working across real estate, infrastructure, private equity, and venture capital transactions. Aman Mittal, Moelis Mittal began his career studying electronics and communications engineering in India before joining Bain & Company as an analyst in its technology, media, and telecom practice. He later moved into digital-infrastructure advisory work and, at Moelis, has worked on more than 15 data-center-related transactions totaling more than $25 billion in value. His recent mandates include Apollo's acquisition of Stream Data Centers. And he helped Prime Data Centers, another platform in the space, arrange the sale of an undisclosed ownership stake to the institutional investors Snowhawk and Nuveen. Nikunj Jain, Bridgewater Jain studied machine learning, taught undergraduate math, interned at Apple in machine learning engineering, and worked for the Department of Defense before joining Bridgewater, where he's now head of Asia research. After graduating from UC Berkeley in two and a half years, he pursued quantitative finance after a friend suggested it. He said he found the Bay Area "a little slower than I would have liked" — a description he's shaken off by running a 15- to 20-person team synthesizing regional activity into trading signals at the giant hedge fund. Jackie Shepherd, Morgan Stanley Before joining the ranks of Wall Street, Shepherd spent years competing in Division I golf, earning a full-ride scholarship and captaining the University of Minnesota's team. She began her career in accounting at EY's international tax practice, where she first encountered investment banking. "I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two," she told Business Insider. "I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas." So she made the pivot to Wall Street. After holding roles at Goldman Sachs and Citi, she joined Morgan Stanley's separations and structured solutions group. Shepherd has worked on roughly $250 billion in transactions, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks. Golf, she said, remains a key part of her life, adding that aspires to play on all seven continents. Jump to

Title: Who are the frontrunners for the top Fed job?

The high-stakes search for a new leader of the US central bank is drawing to a close. US President Donald Trump is expected to name someone in the coming weeks to replace Jerome Powell, whose term as Federal Reserve chairman will end in May. That person will step into the role at a tricky moment. The bank is contending with both political pressure and internal disagreement about how it should set interest rates in the months ahead. Credibility concerns could make the job even harder. Trump has made clear he wants lower borrowing costs and put unusual pressure on the Fed, raising questions about whether whoever wins the post will act independently. Trump's nominee would then go to the Senate for confirmation. Here's what to know about the frontrunners. Kevin Hassett, a long-time conservative economist and key Trump economic adviser, is seen as a top contender to succeed Powell. A Trump loyalist, Hassett, 63, served as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during Trump's first term and now leads the National Economic Council. His odds of clinching the role have dropped since early December, but Wall Street traders still deem him the most likely choice. Hassett has been a stalwart defender of Trump's economic policies, downplaying data showing signs of weakness in the US economy and repeating allegations of bias at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. His allegiance to the president has drawn questions from analysts about whether he would act independently at the Fed and how much sway he would have with other members of the board. In a research note, Deutsche Bank economists wrote that Hassett might struggle, at least initially, to convince other policymakers to put aside concerns about inflation and cut rates meaningfully. "Other officials might be sceptical of forward-looking arguments that rely heavily on the administration's policies bringing inflation closer to target," they wrote. Even some within the Trump administration have reportedly questioned whether Hassett has the skills needed to effectively take the helm of the central bank. Hassett addressed those questions in a CNBC interview this month, saying that the Fed's independence was "really, really important", while reiterating that interest rates still had room to fall. "The way you've got to drive interest-rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data," he said. Kevin Warsh, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, has re-emerged in recent weeks as another potential pick. The 55 year-old economist, a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution who serves on the board of UPS, had also been considered for Fed chair during Trump's first term. He briefly overtook Hassett in prediction markets this month before falling back to second place. "I think the two Kevins are great," Trump told the Wall Street Journal this month. Warsh has been an outspoken Fed critic, lambasting everything from the central bank's heavy reliance on data to its use of assets on its balance sheet. He has escalated his rhetoric since emerging as a contender for the top Fed job this year, calling for "regime change". Warsh had a relatively "hawkish" reputation as Fed governor, meaning that he tended to favour higher interest rates and focused on concerns about inflation. But he is now seen as a voice that would support lower rates in the near term. He has argued that the Fed should shrink its balance sheet in order to bring down short-term interest rates, though some have questioned that logic. "He thinks you have to lower interest rates," Trump told the Journal. "And so does everybody else that I've talked to." Warsh also has close family connections to Trump's orbit. His father-in-law, billionaire businessman Ronald Lauder, is a longtime Trump donor and ally. Christopher Waller, a current Fed governor, recently met with Trump for an interview, boosting his chances for the job in prediction markets. He was nominated to the Fed's board by Trump in 2020 and has recently stressed that the Fed has room to lower interest rates even further. Waller, 66, lacks the personal ties that could help propel Hassett and Warsh to the top of Trump's list. Wall Street, however, has looked favourably upon his relative distance from the White House. Trump, when asked about Waller following their meeting, called him "great", adding that "he's a man who's been there a long time". While the two Kevins remain the favourites, Waller is emerging as "the more sensible choice", said Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital. He noted that choosing Waller could open up two spots on the Fed board for Trump to fill next year, since Fed governor Stephen Miran's term is set to end. It remains to be seen who will satisfy the president. Other names floated include BlackRock executive Rick Reider and even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. In the end, no matter who emerges the winner from this contest, it may be Wall Street that serves as final judge of their success. Ukraine's leader gives an upbeat assessment after discussing the plan with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Rep Joyce Beatty, who sits on the centre's board, argues the name change is illegal because it requires approval from Congress. Norad got some help from President Donald Trump as it marked its 70th year tracking Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. The Trump administration argues the deployment is essential for the safety of immigration enforcement agents. The largest release of Epstein-related documents yet from the justice department included some notable messages and several mentions of Trump. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Title: BlackRock pins Bitcoin ETF as major theme alongside T-bills, tech stocks

BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF has featured on the $13.5 trillion asset manager's homepage, representing one of three major investment themes as the market heads into 2026. Cointelegraph in your social feed BlackRock says its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund was one of its three biggest investment themes in 2025, putting it alongside Treasury bills and the largest US tech stocks. The asset manager named its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) alongside its ETF tracking Treasury bills and another tied to the “Magnificent 7” tech stocks of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla. IBIT has attracted more than $25 billion in net inflows this year, ranking sixth among all ETFs and trailing broad index funds, despite the fund delivering a negative return so far for 2025. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said on Monday that BlackRock's naming IBIT signals the firm isn’t fazed by Bitcoin’s (BTC) 30% fall from its high set in October. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed a similar sentiment on Friday, saying if the ETF “can do $25 billion in a bad year, imagine the flow potential in a good year.” The $25 billion in inflows adds to the roughly $37 billion that IBIT brought in over 2024, bringing its total inflows since launch to $62.5 billion, Farside Investors data shows. IBIT’s flow tally is more than five times that of its nearest competitor, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC). Related: Recent Bitcoin miner capitulation may signal bottom is near: VanEck BlackRock filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF in September. The product seeks to sell covered call options on Bitcoin futures, collecting premiums to generate yield. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has exceeded expectations too, attracting over $9.1 billion worth of inflows this year, bringing its total tally to nearly $12.7 billion. It also filed to register an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF in November to complement ETHA. BlackRock initially opted not to incorporate staking in ETHA. However, a more crypto-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission has loosened its ETF standards, allowing asset managers to experiment with new product ideas. BlackRock hasn’t participated in the altcoin ETF craze that other asset managers have taken part in, which has so far seen the likes of Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) products launch in recent months.

Title: Canada's Prime Minister Carney names financier Mark Wiseman as the next ambassador to Washington

Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced that financier Mark Wiseman will be Canada's next ambassador to the U.S. Wiseman will assume the role on February 15 and will be involved in negotiations regarding the review of their free trade agreement TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced on Monday that financier Mark Wiseman will serve as the country's next ambassador to the United States, an appointment that comes at a critical time in relations between the two major trading partners. Wiseman will assume the role on Feb. 15 and will be involved in negotiations with the U.S. regarding the review of their free trade agreement. “Mark Wiseman brings immense experience, contacts, and deep commitment at this crucial time of transformation of our relationship with the United States,” Carney said in a statement. “As a core member of our negotiating team, he will help advance the interests of Canadian workers, businesses, and institutions.” Wiseman replaces Kirsten Hillman, who announced her resignation earlier this month. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact, or USMCA, is up for review in 2026. U.S. President Donald Trump negotiated the deal during his first term in office and included a clause to possibly renegotiate it in 2026. Wiseman, 55, ran the investment fund of the Canada Pension Plan and also managed equity funds at the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. He is a friend of Carney, who ran the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013 and the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020. In 2016 Wiseman became the senior managing director and global head of active equities at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. Wiseman was once touted as a possible successor to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, though his tenure at the company was cut short in 2019 when he departed after he failed to disclose a consensual relationship with a colleague. He has since chaired the Alberta Investment Management Corp. “Mark Wiseman is a business type with Wall Street connections whose profile is in sync with the current focus on trade and economic investment of both the Carney government and the Trump administration. Yet, Wiseman has no prior diplomatic experience," said Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. In October, Trump cut off tariff negotiations with Carney after the Ontario provincial government ran an antitariff advertisement in the U.S. It followed a spring of acrimony, since abated, over Trump’s insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, as are 85% of U.S. electricity imports. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

ST PHOTO: CHONG JUN LIANG Published Dec 23, 2025, 07:40 AM Updated Dec 23, 2025, 07:36 PM LONDON – Sir James Dyson is reshaping how he manages Britain’s biggest fortune, streamlining his sprawling business empire across three continents after new leaders took the reins of his family holding company. Weybourne, the Dyson family’s investment firm, has transferred funds totalling at least £624 million (S$1.08 billion) from a major UK entity in 2025 to its Singapore holding company, reducing the British unit’s share capital to £1, according to an analysis of registry filings by Bloomberg. It has also finalised earlier plans to close two British firms overseeing property investments and transferred part of their share capital to another entity in Singapore, where Mr Dyson’s eponymous vacuum maker has its global headquarters. Meanwhile, Weybourne has posted job openings in recent weeks for a “new team” in Singapore to support a multi-asset investment portfolio and has scaled back its US footprint after spending almost US$200 million (S$257 million) on New York real estate. A representative for the 78-year-old – Britain’s richest person with a net worth of about US$16.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index – declined to comment. The changes are likely “part of a multi-year succession road map”, said Mr Martin Roll, a global family business strategist and senior adviser at McKinsey & Co. It is “long-term planning”. The moves signal that Weybourne’s new leadership is leaving its mark on Mr Dyson’s fortune, taking steps to reduce the complexity of a business empire that has rapidly expanded in recent years, after he extracted large sums from his namesake technology company to diversify his wealth. Mr Martin Bowen, a legal veteran from Dyson Group, became Weybourne’s chief executive in February following the retirement of former army officer James Bucknall, who held the role for more than a decade. Mr Martin Bowen Weybourne also promoted senior money manager Jane Simpson to chief investment officer for its financial assets in a London-based role in 2024, when former BlackRock executive Alastair Peters became chief financial officer (CFO) in a previously unreported move. Weybourne’s new team in Singapore will work with the CFO unit led by Mr Peters, who turns 43 in December and forms part of a younger set of executives at the family investment firm. Mr Bowen, a former chief legal officer at Dyson’s technology firm who is 57 in December, is a decade younger than the former CEO Mr Bucknall, highlighting how longstanding money managers of the super-rich need to hone succession plans for their own leadership as well as for their employers. At least a fifth of the world’s 500 richest people now have a family office, helping preserve fortunes totalling more than US$5 trillion, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index. “People forget that family offices are another family business,” said Ms Christina Wing, co-founder of Wingspan Legacy Partners, which advises billionaire dynasties. “They also need to change.” Like many family offices, Weybourne reflects its founder’s roots, bearing the name of a coastal village in the part of England where Mr Dyson grew up. The month after Mr Bowen became its CEO in February, the firm’s main British entity, Weybourne Limited, returned £24.2 million in share capital to its Singapore parent company, filings show. It withdrew a further £600 million in December, reversing a transaction between the entities four years ago that a Dyson representative previously told Bloomberg helped improve governance structures. Separately, under plans disclosed publicly in late 2024, a Weybourne property firm based in Britain closed in December after transferring ownership of its real estate investments to a Singapore entity in a £26.4 million transaction. Another property firm in Britain named after Mr Dyson’s Gloucestershire estate, Dodington Park, closed in 2025 after similarly transferring its real estate investments to the billionaire’s namesake farming business. That inflow for Dyson Farming achieved “operational efficiencies”, Weybourne Limited said in its 2024 accounts filed in October, underscoring the benefits of corporate housekeeping across the British billionaire’s empire. Mr Dyson is lining up a further diversification of his fortune, which remains mostly tied up in his technology company, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index. In 2025, his vacuum maker committed to boosting its annual dividends to the billionaire’s Singapore-based Weybourne Holdings to £225 million, reversing a recent trend of declining payouts. It previously paid a £200 million dividend for 2024, its lowest total in at least seven years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While there has been a global boom over the past two decades in the number of family investment firms catering to the needs of the world’s ultra-rich, few are as large as Weybourne. Created in 2013, it now has more than 70 employees across teams in London and Singapore, where it set up an insurance unit three years ago to help protect Dyson’s financial affairs and has recently sought to hire staff. Weybourne last publicly disclosed net assets in the UK of £4.5 billion in 2019, when the technology firm Mr Dyson founded more than two decades ago said it was relocating its headquarters to Singapore. Its other recent job openings include a UK position on its human resources team, a rare feature among investment firms of the ultra-wealthy. “It keeps a lot in-house that peers outsource,” said Mr Marc Debois, founder of FO-Next, an advisory firm for family offices. “Weybourne needs the bodies.” BLOOMBERG E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Title: Wall Street’s bid on crypto dominated 2025 but what’s the demand outlook for 2026?

Time Published: 2025-12-22T23:06:27Z
Full Content:
Fed policy shifts and crypto-friendly regulation point to a bullish 2026, but AI risk, ETF flows and consumer stress could test demand. Cointelegraph in your social feed 2025 was a blockbuster year for Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider crypto market as crypto-friendly legislators platformed growth-focused regulation and Wall Street finally accepted Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), and numerous altcoins as a valid asset class worthy of inclusion in an investment portfolio. The global bid on Bitcoin, Ether and Solana’s SOL (SOL) token was near immeasurable, with total net flows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs reaching $57 billion and the total net assets across the ETFs reaching $114.8 billion. Going into 2026, the real question is whether the pace of institutional, corporate and government-level adoption, which were critical price drivers in 2025, will continue. Since October, the robust inflows to the spot Bitcoin ETF tapered off and, in some cases, turned into a sellers' market for weeks on end, and this was followed by a 30% correction in BTC and 50% in Ether. In an interview with Schwab Network’s Nicole Petallides, Cointelegraph head of markets Ray Salmond said that the crypto market’s performance in early 2026 will depend on a range of factors. .@Cointelegraph's Head of Markets Ray Salmond tells @NPetallides that he expects bitcoin, ethereum and solana demand in the spot and ETF markets to set the tone for the industry in 2026.For more market news, tune into: https://t.co/PYaqKPRp8C pic.twitter.com/ZCp1EIXyUh Beyond the ETF flows and demand across spot markets like Binance and Coinbase, investor sentiment regarding the immense size of the AI industry buildout and the performance of the tech-heavy S&P 500 is likely to have a direct impact on crypto markets. The AI buildout, company valuations, fundraising, IPO performance and whether datacenter hyperscalers continue to propel the equities markets alongside MAG7 will remain at the forefront of everyone’s mind. In the interview, Salmond said rapid balance sheet expansion was a strategy that supercharged tech-related equities in 2025 as hyperscalers spent double-digit billions on data centers, compute, Nvidia GPUs and energy. At some point in 2026, the expectation will be that these companies demonstrate that they can monetize their investments, or at least finance the expansions from their internal cash flow. In the latter half of 2025, Oracle, Meta and Nvidia saw their stock prices fall as the market questioned whether there was a chance that some of these companies’ free cash flow could go negative. If investors smell smoke related to debt-heavy, cash-poor AI and quantum computing companies in 2026, there’s likely to be some negative reaction. How these shockwaves carry over to the SPX, DOW, and, by proxy, crypto is something investors will need to keep on the watch list. A bullish event worth watching in the early part of 2026 will be whether or not the Clarity Act becomes law. The crypto lobby aimed to have this act passed into law before the end of the year, but the lengthy government shutdown delayed progress on hammering it out. If passed, the Clarity Act will provide clearer rules and the necessary environment for FinTech innovators to sandbox in the US, and the hope is that more offshored crypto businesses will headquarter back in the United States. It will define which regulatory bodies (SEC and CFTC) have jurisdiction over various crypto assets, depending on whether they are classified as securities or commodities. There’s also a strong emphasis on consumer protections, and a better framework in this area could provide the necessary transparency that businesses and consumers need to confidently invest in crypto assets. The Federal Reserve’s policy shift is expected to further morph into an easy money regime, and US President Donald Trump’s early 2026 Fed chair selection is anticipated to bring up to 100 basis points in rate cuts. According to Salmond, Salmond explained that “the job market is softening and this cooling trend is predicted to carry on in 2026. The ‘transitory’ impact of the Trump tariffs has resulted in elevated goods and services costs, health insurance premiums will rise, and retail investor confidence may drop as layoffs are announced, consumer debt rises and disposable income falls.” At the same time, “investors expect Fed rate cuts to result in lower mortgage rates, compel banks to loosen the purse strings for lending and lure consumers to go buy more stuff. But, the potential return of easy money policy and big government spending essentially confirms that the US is kicking the debt bomb further down the road.” Related: JPMorgan explores crypto trading for institutional clients: Report In Q1 2026, the dilemma investors will have to contend with is whether there are signals that prove that the Fed's easy money trade is being front-run and possibly sold on confirmation, or will the evolving Fed policy also reinvigorate the bull market seen across equities in 2025 and extend to crypto? Investors who prioritize optionality and a nimble footprint should be able to avoid some of the pitfalls of a narrative and speculation-driven market, where the MAG7 and AI markets could prove to be overvalued. On paper, the big picture view for 2026 is bullish, especially when considering the Trump economic mandate, Fed policy and crypto-friendly regulation, but it’s the unknown outcomes of the AI buildout and the actual impact of rate cuts on the consumer and economy that are going to determine the direction markets take in Q1 and Q2.

December 22, 2025 17:50 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 22 December 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Wegovy® pill (once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg) to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events*. The Wegovy® pill is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist therapy approved for weight management. The approval is based on the OASIS trial programme and the SELECT trial2. In the OASIS 4 trial, oral semaglutide 25 mg taken once daily demonstrated 16.6% mean weight loss when treatment was adhered to in adult participants with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities1. The weight loss achieved with the Wegovy® pill is similar to that of injectable Wegovy® 2.4 mg. Furthermore, one in three people experienced 20% or greater weight loss in the OASIS 4 trial1. The well-known safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide was reaffirmed with the Wegovy® pill in the OASIS-4 trial, which was comparable to previous trials with semaglutide for weight management. “The pill is here. With today's approval of the Wegovy® pill, patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy® injection,” said Mike Doustdar, president and CEO of Novo Nordisk. “As the first oral GLP-1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity, the Wegovy® pill provides patients with a new, convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey. No other current oral GLP-1 treatment can match the weight loss delivered by the Wegovy® pill, and we are very excited for what this will mean for patients in the US”. Novo Nordisk expects to launch the Wegovy® pill in the US in early January 2026. Novo Nordisk has submitted oral semaglutide 25 mg once-daily for obesity to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities during the second half of 2025. About the OASIS trial programmeOASIS was a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg and 50 mg in obesity. The global clinical phase 3 programme consisted of four trials, enrolling approximately 1,300 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities.OASIS 4 was a 64-week efficacy and safety phase 3b trial of once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg versus placebo in 307 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities. About Wegovy® Wegovy® is now approved as once-daily Wegovy® pill (semaglutide tablet 25 mg) and once-weekly Wegovy® injection (semaglutide injectable 2.4 mg) by the FDA. The approval of Wegovy® pill is based on a New Drug Application to reduce excess body weight in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related medical condition. Wegovy® is approved as a once-weekly injection by the EMA and widely by other regulatory authorities. The Wegovy® pill is currently pending marketing approval from the EMA and other regulatory authorities. Wegovy® is indicated to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adults with obesity or overweight and in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition, and approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, such as death, heart attack or stroke in adults with known heart disease and either obesity or overweight. Furthermore, Wegovy® injection is indicated to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in paediatric patients aged 12 years and older, and approved by the FDA for the treatment of MASH in adults with moderate to advanced liver scarring (fibrosis), but not with cirrhosis of the liver.

Google told employees it will be "ramping up" PERM applications in 2026 for eligible employees, a crucial step to securing a green card. The company told staff in a December newsletter that employees eligible for PERM would hear from its outside lawyers in Q1, according to a copy of the memo seen by Business Insider. PERM allows employees to move from working on a visa to securing a green card. Tech companies commonly use it to transition staff from H-1 B status to a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US. Tech employees on work visas have faced increased uncertainty this year due to policy changes, such as the rise in H-1B visa fees. Google's lawyers recently advised employees with work visas, such as the H-1B, to avoid international travel due to "significant" delays, Business Insider reported. According to the memo about PERM, only those who meet certain criteria will be eligible for the application. One requirement is that employees must work in a role that requires a degree and prior work experience. Every time Hugh publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox!

"Remote Googlers must agree to transfer to an office to be PERM eligible," the memo read. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The PERM process is designed to ensure that hiring foreign workers doesn't harm the job opportunities or working conditions of US workers. As such, the company sponsoring the worker must prove that there are no available qualified US citizens who can fill the role. Google paused PERM applications in January 2023, the same month it laid off 12,000 employees, Business Insider previously reported. Amazon, Meta, and other tech companies similarly put the brakes on PERM as a wave of job cuts made it harder to justify hiring outside the US, as per the program's terms. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for the newsletter. The sweeping layoffs meant the market was flooded with people looking for work, making it harder for employers to hire foreign workers. Google applied for PERM for a small handful of employees throughout this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. The announcement about 2026 marks a scaling up of the program, the person said. Google told staff in the memo that there is a bar to clear for PERM applications. Employees who are at Level 3 roles or below will be less likely to meet the requirements, the memo said. It also said that Google employees would not be considered for PERM if they are "not in good standing" with the company. "Googlers must have a MI rating or higher to be eligible for PERM," it read. MI means "moderate impact" — a rating Googlers can be given in their yearly performance reviews. Have something to share?

Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney, has appointed financier and former BlackRock executive Mark Wiseman as Canada's ambassador to the US, ahead of major trade talks with the Trump administration. Wiseman, an experienced investment manager, takes on the task as Canada works to reset its strained relations with the US while preparing for a tense review of the current free trade deal. His appointment follows current ambassador Kirsten Hillman's announcement that she would be ending her tenure in Washington. Carney said Wiseman "brings immense experience, extensive contacts and deep commitment" to the post at a "crucial time of transformation" for Canada and the US. "As a core member of our negotiating team, he will help advance the interests of Canadian workers, businesses, and institutions, while building opportunities for both Canada and the United States," the prime minister said in a statement on Monday. The new ambassador is set to take on the role in mid-February, Carney added. Wiseman, 55, reportedly a close friend of Carney's, is currently a senior advisor and chairman of Canada at Lazard, a financial services company, and a senior advisor at Boston Consulting Group, a consultancy firm. In March, Carney added him as a member of the prime minister's council on Canada-US relations, a group formed to navigate the currently turbulent bilateral relationship. The Yale alumni also previously worked in both New York and Paris as a lawyer with law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. He is one of the co-founders of the Century Initiative, a charitable organisation that has lobbied for increased immigration levels in Canada, with the goal reaching 100 million people in the country by 2100 to support economic growth. The role with Century Initiative stirred up criticism ahead of his appointment. Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre has accused Wiseman of being "someone who proposed a policy that inflates the cost of living, takes away jobs and puts pressure on our health care system". "Why does the Prime Minister want to appoint him as ambassador to Washington?" Beyond domestic politics, Wiseman will face the currently thorny relationship between the US and Canada while in Washington. Trump halted trade talks with Canada in late October in anger over an anti-tariff advertisement commissioned by the province of Ontario and aired in the US. Trump has imposed sector-specific tariffs on Canadian metals, lumber and automotives. He has also imposed a sweeping tariff rate of 35% on all goods, though most have been exempt under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) - known at the USMCA in the US - trade pact. A scheduled review of CUSMA is now underway, starting with public hearings and stakeholder consultations, after which Canada, the US and Mexico could agree to renew it, or let it expire. The US president says IS targets were attacked in north-western Nigeria, accusing the group of killing Christians. Test your memory of 2025 in the second part of our quiz.

Terms of North American free trade deal set to be renegotiated in 2026 under shadow of US tariff policies. By News Agencies Share Save Canada has named former BlackRock executive Mark Wiseman as the new ambassador to the United States, with upcoming trade and tariff negotiations likely to dominate his tenure. In a statement on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Wiseman would help manage Canada’s relationship with the US, which has grown stormy under tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. “Mr Wiseman will be a key contributor to the government’s efforts to advance Canada-US priorities, including secure borders [and] a strengthened trade and investment relationship,” Carney said in a statement. Relations between the countries have somewhat settled after the US launched a trade war targeting Canadian goods, prompting anger at what was widely viewed as an act of economic hostility against a longtime ally. The Trump administration has targeted Canada with several rounds of tariffs, including a blanket 25 percent tariff for allegedly failing to stem migration and fentanyl flows from Canada. That came despite data showing only a tiny fraction of fentanyl smuggled into the US crosses the US-Canada border. The US subsequently imposed sweeping tariffs on automobiles, steel and aluminium imports, all of which disproportionately affected Canada. In August, Trump and Carney, who was elected on a promise to take a tough stance in the face of US threats, reached agreements to roll back some of the measures. A more comprehensive deal has remained elusive. Trump has also stirred anger by repeatedly saying that Canada should become the 51st US state, which Carney has firmly rejected. Those tensions could re-emerge in the coming months as officials set out to renegotiate the terms of the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, also known as the USMCA. Canadian officials are set to begin discussions with US counterparts in mid-January on the USMCA, which currently exempts many key products that would otherwise be tariffed under Trump’s policies. Canada is the top export destination for 36 US states, with nearly $2.7bn worth of goods and services crossing the border each day. Carney has hedged his expectations for the future of trade relations with the US, saying that Canada will defend its economic interests but that US policy is beyond its control.

Title: Trump Loses GOP Support on China Policy

Donald Trump is wrecking so much with his blend of impulsivity and personal graft and vanity that it is sometimes hard to distinguish the consequential from the incidental. Far more important than his plastering his name everywhere is Trump’s incoherent China policy, where he keeps raising and lowering tariffs to no strategic purpose while at the same time giving away crown jewels or finding a way to sell them. More from Robert Kuttner Earlier this month, there was widespread outrage in the defense community when Trump reversed policy and allowed Nvidia to sell the H200 in China, its second most advanced artificial intelligence chip. Seven Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick a letter warning that “the President’s dangerous decision to give away crucial national security controls represents a significant departure from longstanding bipartisan efforts to ensure that U.S. technology does not turbocharge China’s military and technological capabilities.” The decision to allow the sale followed months of courtship and flattery of Trump by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Nvidia used a brand-new tech conference in D.C. to lavish praise on Trump, and Huang gave generously to Trump’s ballroom project and has claimed that Trump is ushering in a new Industrial Revolution (his words) with AI. The H200 decision came right after an Oval Office meeting between Huang and Trump. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. In line with Trump’s habit of asking private companies to pay tribute, Nvidia will kick back 25 percent “revenue share” of the value of its China sales to the U.S. government. This doesn’t go directly into Trump’s pocket. But in the great favor bank, Trump will find ways to cash in this favor to Huang for his personal enrichment. Now, however, Congress has pushed back big-time. In the annual defense authorization bill that Trump has just signed into law, a broad bipartisan coalition inserted provisions codifying a 2023 Biden executive order requiring national-security screening of outbound U.S. capital investment in China. In past years, U.S. venture capital firms have supplied a lot of the funds for AI development in China. Funds managed by Vanguard, BlackRock, and Fidelity have major investments in China’s marquee tech company, Alibaba. The authorization bill does not reverse the Nvidia chip approval, but it sends a shot across Trump’s bow and signals more willingness of Republicans to defect from automatic support for Trump. In supporting the new restrictions, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas warned, “Every dollar invested in China by a United States investor into a Chinese company is a dollar that’s going toward the potential production of weapons and technology that one day may be used to kill Americans.” Congress needs to go further and ban sweetheart deals like the Nvidia waiver. Meanwhile, Trump is pulling back on technologies where China increasingly dominates, such as EVs and renewable energy. His treatment of the Caribbean as an American lake and Ukraine as part of greater Russia is a virtual invitation for China to invade Taiwan. While Trump is obsessed with Venezuela as a national-security threat and imposes vanity tariffs on friendly nations like Canada that fall short of his standards of genuflection, militarily and commercially he is letting China clean America’s clock.

Please let us know The Business Topic:Reserve Bank Of Australia Interest rates fell, inflation kept surprising and the AI billions and trillions kept flowing: world stock markets had a party. (Unsplash: Krys Amon/licence) AI. Market records. Tariffs. Penguins. TACO. It's been a big year of economic shocks and surges as the international framework of global trade was shredded. In other major news, a company famous for making gaming PC chips became the world's most valuable, and Australia's key interest rate stuttered downwards then flatlined. George Tharenou, chief economist for Australia at investment bank UBS, was in New York during April's so-called "liberation day", when US President Donald Trump revealed a sweeping regime of tariffs that stunned global markets. "It was surreal seeing the markets move to meltdown amid the uncertainty," he recalled. "This is a true bubble-like mentality, and it doesn't look like there's initially anything right now to pop it," argues UBS's George Tharenou. (ABC News: John Gunn) And there were many more shocks to come. To analyse the hits and misses of 2025, the ABC quizzed some of Australia's most prominent economists about four intertwined elements that helped to define the year. Those key events and trends: Asked to summarise 2025's economic picture, Shane Oliver, the head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP, was succinct: "Resilience. But tell that to the penguins of the uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands to the distant south-west of Australia — bizarrely singled out in one of the biggest developments of the year, April's US tariffs. Placing heavy tariffs on exports from islands that have no human residents or trade with the US was emblematic of the chaos unleashed when the US administration revealed expensive new costs on goods sent to the nation. "The big thing for the last year in terms of markets has just been how strong they've been," says Shane Oliver. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine) "What we saw on 'liberation day' was a sign that Donald Trump wanted to rip up the global architecture that had prevailed for much of the post-[World War II] period," Dr Oliver said. The tariffs place a cost on trade from allies, neighbours and perceived enemies alike. While staunch US allies such as Australia and the UK were hit with a 10 per cent rate, at one point, a 145 per cent tariff was going to be put on trade with China. The US defended placing tariffs on islands that lacked trade or humans, suggesting that otherwise they would become a penguin-portal of countries seeking to avoid US levies. "The idea is that there are no countries left off," US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told broadcaster CBS. Taxing penguins was just part of the slapdash nature of the levies, which would make goods imported into the US more expensive, according to Dr Oliver. The impact — as countries scrambled for deals, exceptions and new markets for their goods — was panic. Sally Auld, chief economist at NAB, said she grabbed the red pen, essentially revising down projections of US and global economic growth for 2025. But as deals were made and the application of many tariffs was paused, that frosty view thawed. NAB chief economist Sally Auld says stock markets, worldwide, are buoyant for a single reason: "The whole tech complex has really led the market higher." (ABC News: John Gunn) Australia held on the "baseline" 10 per cent tax on goods exported to the US, while countries across the globe cut deals. "It became clear that most other countries really just didn't want to fight," Ms Auld said. Betashares chief economist David Bassanese watched the initial tariff hit play out on financial markets. "Markets reacted, fearing it could tip the US economy into recession," he recalled. What came next was the so-called "TACO trade" — standing for Trump Always Chickens Out — when the negative impact of deals or ideas became known. "We didn't get a tit-for-tat escalation in the trade wars. So most countries … basically rolled over and accepted the tariffs that Donald Trump imposed on them," says David Bassanese. (ABC News: John Gunn) "We have seen that. He has scaled back the tariffs through the course of the year. He's announced some deals with countries," Mr Bassanese said. Our nation is heavily exposed to moves in global trade — particularly commodity markets that set the price for exports like iron ore and gold. But at the start of the year, a huge focus was placed on a boardroom in a temporary office in Sydney, where the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board was meeting to set interest rates. At the start of the year, anticipation of a cut to official interest rates was intense. The RBA had hiked the cash rate to 4.35 per cent in November 2023 and held it there through 2024. With around one-third of Australians servicing a mortgage — and a further third renting, many from landlords with mortgages — the public was feeling the pain of higher repayments. Consumers slashed their spending as the cost-of-living crisis kept chomping at household budgets. "There was undoubtedly a lot of tension," said independent economist Nicki Hutley. "Part of the reason [households] were doing it tough wasn't just interest rates, it was higher-than-usual inflation." "We're very tightly poised", said independent economist Nicki Hutley, between lowering inflation without risking some significant rises in the unemployment rate. (ABC News: John Gunn) By late 2022, consumer prices were rising at a rate of 7.8 per cent a year. That tempered this year, with price rises at one point slowing to 1.9 per cent, below the 2–3 per cent target range the central bank was aiming for. The RBA cut the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points in February, May and August. "The pressure was there because we could see inflation was coming down, we could see the economy was really, really sluggish," Ms Hutley said. NAB's Ms Auld said the impact of a lower cost of money was flowing through the economy, with stronger consumer spending and higher housing prices. "The challenge has been that the recovery that we've got is already starting to lessen the scope for inflation to fall," she said. Most market watchers have now changed their initial view that the RBA would cut rates further in the final months of 2025 or the start of 2026, as inflation has ticked up, once again rising above the central bank's 2–3 per cent target. Mr Tharenou has what will be an unpopular view for people with big outstanding debts — interest rates are more likely to go up than down. It's a view shared by a growing cohort of economists, and expressed by RBA governor Michele Bullock herself. "I think begrudgingly the RBA is going to shift towards raising the cash rate by the middle of next year," Mr Tharenou said. AMP has forecast rates to remain on hold through 2026, with the risk skewing towards a hike. Dr Oliver said in order for a rate cut to be back on the table, unemployment would need to rise. In the most recent data, the unemployment rate remained at 4.3 per cent in November, down from 4.4 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms in September. At the end of 2024, both the trend and seasonally adjusted measures were 4 per cent. The RBA's rate-setting board next meets on February 2 and 3. "Liberation day" might have sounded like freedom but the initial reaction of global stock markets was unrestrained panic. In New York, the S&P 500 index wiped $7.5 trillion in value in the two days after the announcement. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 22 per cent from its December 2024 record close and the Dow Jones, European indices and Australia's markets fell more than 5 per cent. "The push-pull factors in markets this year have been a) Donald Trump and tariffs, but b) the positive of the AI boom," said Betashares's Mr Bassanese. Massive investments in artificial intelligence, data centres and computer chips propelled the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech companies most exposed to the boom — Google's parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Facebook's parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Nvidia. The stock price of the latter has rocketed more than 1,200 per cent after its computer chips — originally powering the visuals of gaming computers — became the bedrock of an AI boom. Nvidia leapfrogged Microsoft to become the most valuable company in the world, and the first to be valued at more than $US4 trillion ($6 trillion). It's what George Tharenou of UBS describes as an "up-crash". "It's almost a detachment from fundamentals," he said. "We haven't really had a boom in the real economy, but we have had a boom in asset markets." "People call it FOMO [Fear of Missing Out]. The higher the price, the higher the demand. People just want to get into asset markets and not miss out." Despite a recent dip, the ASX 200 index of our largest companies is up close to 5 per cent year-to-date. That makes sense to Shane Oliver of AMP. "We've seen the interest rate cuts, we've seen profits, particularly in the US, continue to surprise on the upside. And even though conditions have been on the soft side [in Australia], we've avoided recession". The runaway performance of the "Magnificent Seven" has brought fears of a repeat of the late-1990s, early-2000s dot-com market crash. But there's a key difference, said NAB's Sally Auld. While the dot-com bubble and the subsequent burst were driven by hysteria around companies trading at really expensive valuations despite being "yet to turn a dollar", Ms Auld said, "that's definitely not the case this time around". Bolstering that case is the mind-melting amounts of money being spent on data centres, factories and technology to power the AI revolution. "I think that number is now close to $500 billion, which is a huge number, and really forcing people to accept that this is a new innovation cycle," she said. The capital expenditure has been so large that it has put a so-called floor under the growth of the US economy. "Somewhere between 40 to 50 per cent of [gross domestic product] growth in the first six months of this year in the US can be accounted for by that huge AI capex spend — it's helping to prop up equity markets." The potential impact remains huge. So is the risk. "We're all openly talking about the fact that there are bubbles and almost thinking that it doesn't matter, that somehow, mystically, this time will be different," economist Nicki Hutley said. George Tharenou is another who isn't convinced the gains are justified by fundamentals. "It's almost the opposite of the law of economics," says Mr Tharenou, describing this year's market behaviour.

Please let us know The Business Topic:Reserve Bank Of Australia Interest rates fell, inflation kept surprising and the AI billions and trillions kept flowing: world stock markets had a party. (Unsplash: Krys Amon/licence) AI. Market records. Tariffs. Penguins. TACO. It's been a big year of economic shocks and surges as the international framework of global trade was shredded. In other major news, a company famous for making gaming PC chips became the world's most valuable, and Australia's key interest rate stuttered downwards then flatlined. George Tharenou, chief economist for Australia at investment bank UBS, was in New York during April's so-called "liberation day", when US President Donald Trump revealed a sweeping regime of tariffs that stunned global markets. "It was surreal seeing the markets move to meltdown amid the uncertainty," he recalled. "This is a true bubble-like mentality, and it doesn't look like there's initially anything right now to pop it," argues UBS's George Tharenou. (ABC News: John Gunn) And there were many more shocks to come. To analyse the hits and misses of 2025, the ABC quizzed some of Australia's most prominent economists about four intertwined elements that helped to define the year. Those key events and trends: Asked to summarise 2025's economic picture, Shane Oliver, the head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP, was succinct: "Resilience. But tell that to the penguins of the uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands to the distant south-west of Australia — bizarrely singled out in one of the biggest developments of the year, April's US tariffs. Placing heavy tariffs on exports from islands that have no human residents or trade with the US was emblematic of the chaos unleashed when the US administration revealed expensive new costs on goods sent to the nation. "The big thing for the last year in terms of markets has just been how strong they've been," says Shane Oliver. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine) "What we saw on 'liberation day' was a sign that Donald Trump wanted to rip up the global architecture that had prevailed for much of the post-[World War II] period," Dr Oliver said. The tariffs place a cost on trade from allies, neighbours and perceived enemies alike. While staunch US allies such as Australia and the UK were hit with a 10 per cent rate, at one point, a 145 per cent tariff was going to be put on trade with China. The US defended placing tariffs on islands that lacked trade or humans, suggesting that otherwise they would become a penguin-portal of countries seeking to avoid US levies. "The idea is that there are no countries left off," US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told broadcaster CBS. Taxing penguins was just part of the slapdash nature of the levies, which would make goods imported into the US more expensive, according to Dr Oliver. The impact — as countries scrambled for deals, exceptions and new markets for their goods — was panic. Sally Auld, chief economist at NAB, said she grabbed the red pen, essentially revising down projections of US and global economic growth for 2025. But as deals were made and the application of many tariffs was paused, that frosty view thawed. NAB chief economist Sally Auld says stock markets, worldwide, are buoyant for a single reason: "The whole tech complex has really led the market higher." (ABC News: John Gunn) Australia held on the "baseline" 10 per cent tax on goods exported to the US, while countries across the globe cut deals. "It became clear that most other countries really just didn't want to fight," Ms Auld said. Betashares chief economist David Bassanese watched the initial tariff hit play out on financial markets. "Markets reacted, fearing it could tip the US economy into recession," he recalled. What came next was the so-called "TACO trade" — standing for Trump Always Chickens Out — when the negative impact of deals or ideas became known. "We didn't get a tit-for-tat escalation in the trade wars. So most countries … basically rolled over and accepted the tariffs that Donald Trump imposed on them," says David Bassanese. (ABC News: John Gunn) "We have seen that. He has scaled back the tariffs through the course of the year. He's announced some deals with countries," Mr Bassanese said. Our nation is heavily exposed to moves in global trade — particularly commodity markets that set the price for exports like iron ore and gold.

Title: The biggest games industry news stories of 2025 | Year in Review

AI outrage, a delay to GTA 6, takeover deals for EA and Warner Bros., US tariffs, the Steam Machine, Switch 2… there's a lot to get through Join us as we journey back through 2025 via the biggest games industry news stories of the year, including massive takeover deals, the closure of historic studios, big hardware launches, big hardware reveals, and a lot of bother about tariffs. Following the catastrophic failure of Concord in 2024, Sony pulled back further from the live-service strategy it had embarked upon under the leadership of Jim Ryan, who back in 2022 said that through "close collaboration between Bungie and the PlayStation Studios, we aim to launch more than 10 live service games by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026." In January, Sony confirmed the cancellation of two unannounced live service titles from Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games; this and other high-profile live-service failures and cancellations led Rob Fahey to suggest that the industry's decade-long race for live-service riches was finally over. In an interview in January, Phil Spencer, Microsoft's CEO of gaming, gave further details about the plans to make Xbox first-party titles available across other platforms. "There's no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place where it would find players, where it would have business success for us," he said. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would go on to launch on PS5 in April, and in July it was reported that six of the ten best-selling games on PlayStation from April 6 to July 5 were published by Microsoft. In October, something that would have once been unthinkable happened – Halo: Campaign Evolved was announced for PS5. Warner Bros. Games announced the closure of Warner Bros. Games San Diego, Player First Games (maker of MultiVersus), and Monolith Productions in February. Monolith had been in existence for more than 30 years, and was behind such titles as No One Lives Forever, FEAR, and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. At the time of its closure, the studio was working on a new Wonder Woman game, which has now been cancelled. Although total layoff figures were down by around a third in 2025, the year saw the closure of a number of studios, including Ubisoft Leamington and a range of NetEase developers: see our feature looking back at the year in layoffs for more details. On the same day as Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct presentation (April 2), US president Donald Trump announced punitive tariffs on goods arriving from dozens of countries, causing a rush of speculation on how this would affect the games industry. Nintendo quickly moved to delay Switch 2 pre-orders in the States; they finally went live on April 24, with the console's US price unchanged, but with Switch 2 accessories rising in price "due to changes in market conditions." Sony said it was considering manufacturing PlayStation 5 consoles in the US as a result of tariffs, and retro handheld maker Anbernic suspended shipments to the States. Nintendo later hiked the US prices of the original Switch by up to 15%, and the US saw similar price rises for the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. Rob Fahey suggested the US tariffs "will likely force a strategic shift around the next generation of console hardware." In May, a US court enforced an injunction which prohibits Apple from collecting fees on app purchases made outside its App Store; the landmark ruling is likely to change the app landscape. The previous month, Apple was fined €500 million ($568 million) by the EU for deterring third-party payment methods on the App Store. Similarly, Google made changes in October to allow third-party payment systems after a US court ruling said Google could no longer restrict customers to using Google Play Billing. Then in November, Google and Epic Games agreed on a deal that will potentially pave the way for third-party app stores to be made available on Android worldwide. The Savvy Games Group subsidiary Scopely officially closed its $3.5 billion acquisition of Niantic's game business on May 29. The deal included Niantic's entire game development team, the games Pokémon Go, Pikmin Bloom, and Monster Hunter Now, and the apps Campfire and Wayfarer. Scopely was previously acquired by the Saudi Arabian multinational game investment group Savvy Games Group back in July 2023 for $4.9 billion. Nintendo launched the Switch 2 on June 5, which went on to sell over 3.5 million units in the first four days and 10.36 million units in its first four months, doubling the figures for the original Switch over the same timeframe. However, questions were soon raised about the relative lack of indie games, the seemingly slow rollout of dev kits, and the use of Game-Key Cards in terms of game preservation. Plus, the Switch 2's initial sales momentum seemed to wind down towards the end of the year: in the US, Circana reported that the combined sales of the Switch and Switch 2 in November were 10% lower than the sales of the Switch in the same period last year. The co-op climbing game Peak from Aggro Crab and Landfall became a breakout hit on Steam in the summer, notching up 10 million sales by the end of August. Not bad for a game that evolved from a month-long game jam. Peak was part of a wave of indie co-op games that hit it big on Steam in 2025, with titles like RV There Yet? shifting 1.3 million units in a week and REPO selling more than 12.3 million (according to Video Game Insights). Other indie titles that became unexpectedly huge on Steam included Dispatch, Megabonk, and the drug-dealing simulator Schedule I. The leadership team of Subnautica studio Unknown Worlds was removed by owner and publisher Krafton in July. There followed a very public falling out and subsequent legal action, with claims and counter-claims being thrown back and forth by Krafton and the former Unknown Worlds employees: you can follow the whole saga here. Another big legal battle kicked off in July when Sony sued Tencent, alleging the latter's game Light of Motiram is a "slavish clone" of its tentpole Horizon series. Tencent subsequently accused Sony of seeking a "monopoly on genre conventions," before eventually settling with Sony in December. Microsoft initiated a huge round of job cuts in July, affecting around 4% of the company's workforce, and causing a major shake-up in the games division. Studios affected included King, Blizzard, Turn 10, Raven Software, ZeniMax Online Studios, and The Initiative, with the latter being shuttered. Rare's Everwild was cancelled, along with an unannounced ZeniMax MMO. In an opinion piece at the time, Lewis Packwood said: "It's hard to dispel the feeling that these cuts are simply part of a disordered retreat." The games industry as a whole saw more than 9,000 layoffs in 2025. Members of the US actors' union SAG-AFTRA voted to end its 11-month strike in July, after reaching a pay agreement and ensuring "safety guardrails and gains around AI." The strike began in July 2024 in a bid to protect voice actors as more and more studios explore generative AI. However, as GamesIndustry.biz revealed in a feature in December, contracts for game actors still remain a nightmare in the UK. The UK's Online Safety Act (OSA) came into force in July, requiring companies to ensure that their games use highly effective age verification. However, some game firms struggled with the complexities of the OSA, with many having to rethink game features, and Itch blocked adult-oriented games on its store after being unable to find a satisfactory age verification solution in time. Jeremy Peel spoke to a range of people affected by the OSA for an in-depth feature for GamesIndustry.biz. Over the summer, a pressure group campaign resulted in a crackdown on adult games on Steam and Itch. It all started with a sexually explicit visual novel called No Mercy: UK technology secretary Peter Kyle had criticised the title in April, and it was subsequently removed from sale in the UK by Zerat Games. But the Australian group Collective Shout took the campaign to the next level by contacting payment processing companies, which put pressure on Steam and Itch to remove sex-related titles. Jeremy Peel gave a rundown of exactly what happened in this feature for GamesIndustry.biz. Activision studio Raven Software ratified its first union contract with Microsoft in August. The new agreement guarantees a 10% wage increase over the next two years, as well as seeking to eliminate crunch and provide workers with seven days' notice for any additional mandatory overtime. A few months later, the ZA/UM Workers' Alliance became the first recognised workers union in the UK games industry. On August 22, Team Cherry announced that Hollow Knight: Silksong would release on September 4, prompting other games companies to rapidly shift their release dates in response. Such was its popularity that the game's release crashed global stores right across Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam's digital platforms, and it would go on to sell over 7 million copies in three months. In September, the Game Developers Conference announced a rebrand as GDC Festival of Gaming, leaving some to speculate that the conference would now be welcoming consumers as well as industry attendees. However, in an interview the following month, the organisers indicated that this wouldn't be the case, saying: "The festival part of the GDC Festival is that we're broadening out what the conference is and does, but not into a consumer space." Reaction to the rebrand was mixed. In late September, it was announced that EA would be purchased by a group of investors comprising Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners. The total deal is worth $55 billion, but $20 billion of that total is being borrowed by the consortium. The deal will almost certainly require regulatory approval, and is expected to close during Q1 FY27, if given the go ahead. Mat Piscatella of Circana was one of several industry commentators who expressed worries about the EA deal: "Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies," he said. A disruption to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in October took thousands of web-based businesses – about a third of the internet – offline, with parts of the US being hardest hit. In the games industry, web-based services affected included Fortnite, Roblox, and PlayStation Network. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) accused Rockstar Games of union busting after the studio dismissed 31 employees who were allegedly attempting to unionise at the end of October. The move led to protests outside Rockstar's offices and the sending of a letter condemning the dismissals that was signed by 220 employees at Rockstar North. Rockstar disputes the claims of union busting, saying the employees were fired for gross misconduct after discussing "confidential information in a public forum." However, UK prime minister Keir Starmer described the dismissals as a "deeply concerning case" and said that ministers would investigate. At the start of November, Take Two Interactive delayed GTA 6 for a second time, moving next year's biggest release back six months to November 19, 2026. The delay caused a wide range of reactions in the games industry. "For many of our clients, it opens up a valuable window," said Damien Sarrazin, CEO & founder of HomeRun PR, "one that was previously seen as completely dominated by Rockstar's marketing and media gravity." Valve announced three new devices in November: the Steam Frame VR headset, a new Steam controller, and the console-like Steam Machine. Of the three, the Steam Machine – set to be released in early 2026 with "pretty competitive" pricing to equivalent PCs – caused the most stir. Rob Fahey suggested it could be an "industry turning point." On November 21, Ubisoft announced the completion of Tencent's €1.16 billion investment in Vantage Studios, the division in charge of the Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises. Prior to the announcement, Ubisoft had postponed the release of its H1 2025-26 financial results and suspended share trading, prompting widespread speculation. At the start of December, news emerged that Netflix was buying entertainment giant Warner Bros. in a deal valued at around $82.7 billion. Soon after, Paramount Skydance launched a rival hostile takeover attempt, which Warner's board advised shareholders to reject. Netflix said that it did not "attribute any value" to Warner Bros' games business as part of its proposed acquisition of the entertainment giant, leaving many to wonder what the deal will mean for Warner Bros. Games. Activision announced it will no longer ship back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games, following significant underperformance of the latest release in the franchise, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. This year, the franchise faced fierce competition from the likes of Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders. Rhys Elliott at Alinea Analytics said: "For years, Call of Duty was virtually immune to competition, but now the player base is splitting and annoyed, the franchise is creatively drained, and rivals have been more methodical and focused." Finally, comments made about generative AI by Larian Studios head Swen Vincke in a Bloomberg interview sparked an explosion of posts on social media in December. This prompted Vincke to issue a hurried clarification, saying that the Baldur's Gate 3 studio is "not replacing concept artists with AI," and that it is only using AI at the "very early ideation stages" as a "rough outline for composition." The episode came on top of several outbursts of AI outrage throughout 2025, including a row over the use of AI speech in Embark Games' Arc Raiders, which prompted Epic Games' Tim Sweeney to wade into the debate in defence of the technology.

From Dario Amodei earning “Founder of the Year” to why SpaceX will IPO before OpenAI, from the talent wars that “threw all conventions out the window” to why unemployment data could trigger a massive tech lash—this is the definitive look at where we’ve been and where we’re going. Spoiler: If you’re a B2B company that didn’t reaccelerate with AI in 2025, you got an F minus. And if unemployment ticks up even 2-3 points next year for any reason? “Society will be terrified of AI.” The unanimous choice wasn’t about predictions of mass unemployment (which the panel largely dismissed). It was about execution. Claude 3.5 and 4 changed everything—enabling vibe coding, powering Cursor, making Lovable and Replit actually work. “Without this, we have no vibe coding,” Jason said. “Many of these products existed for years. They did not work until Claude.” But it’s not just product. Rory highlighted Anthropic’s business execution: “Growth rate faster than OpenAI, valuation convergence even after OpenAI’s potential new round at $800B… he’s cranked out the ‘I’m going to get profitable, I’m going to be sensible.’ If you own those stocks at the start of the year, this is the stock you’d feel most excited about.” Honorable mentions went to Gwyn Shotwell at SpaceX (“navigating geopolitically challenging times with Elon’s brand this year… exceptional”), Alex Wang at Scale AI (“the best of the pseudo-hire playbook—moment in time, playing your cards right”), and Vlad at Robinhood (“Nine products doing over $100 million in revenue. JFC.”). Index wins on pure execution: Wiz (announced this year, $32B), Figma (seed), and Revolut ($75B). “Competent execution across multiple different exits,” Rory said. “Exits are the coin of the realm.” But Jason gave his vote to Neo on aesthetics and hustle: first money into Cursor and Cognition. “24 months ago, he seemed to be having weird arguments with Gary Tan on Twitter. Now he’s literally hustling his way into cursor, hanging out at MIT, giving programming tests himself.” And the wildcard? Google—owning ~10% of SpaceX, ~14% of Anthropic, and the majority of Waymo. “Those three with double-digit ownerships, even if done in a circular way… corporate investor of the year.” Meta paying $100M for individual researchers. The $14B deal to acquire a company’s team while letting investors keep the husk. Nat and Daniel getting their venture fund acquired too. “The entire convention on why people buy companies, how employees get treated, how much a human can be paid to do a job got thrown out of the window in the space of 6 months,” Rory said. In retrospect, the logic makes sense: “If you’re spending $73 billion on capex, spending $5 billion to make sure the people using the capex know what they’re doing probably makes sense.” The other massive surprise? There’s no ceiling on venture outcomes anymore. Lovable going from $2B to $8B valuation in weeks. Anthropic at $100M being “the deal of the century from a risk-reward outcome.” “That there is no ceiling on venture… changes all the math and calculations.” “Every founder, every VC—our job was to ride this torrent of AI,” Jason explained. “If you’re not an LLM, your job this year was to ride the greatest wave of our lifetimes.” Databricks did exactly that. In 2021, Databricks was presenting about managing cloud compute and data—nothing about AI. Now they’re at $5B revenue growing 55%, accelerating, while Snowflake’s AI revenue remains small. “If we had to have canon of the year for who rode the AI wave and utterly changed the trajectory of the company, it would be Databricks.” Other breakouts: Eleven Labs (scaled to $400M ARR, standing off OpenAI competition—”$30 in 10 minutes versus $2,000 in two weeks”), and Open Evidence (capturing 500K of the 1M US doctors in one year by perfectly targeting medical search). Jason’s order: SpaceX goes first (probably summer), Canva second (“the AI story is not perfect, but the numbers are there—do it now before looking obsolete”), Databricks in the back half (“it’s just the Series M”), Anthropic at year-end (“the simpler way to solve their capital needs”). OpenAI? Probably mid-2027. “It’s burning too much.” The challenge: taking a company public at $1 trillion is an unsolved banking problem. “What do you do with $950 billion in stock when many owners have been in for 10-15 years? Could be tricky.” The top B2B public stocks (Palantir, Cloudflare, Monday, Shopify, CrowdStrike, Snowflake) have all figured out their AI tailwinds. Jason’s betting at least three stay in the top six next year: “I’m not a hedge fund guy, but the trends aren’t going to change much.” But the contrarian bet? Salesforce. Trading at all-time low revenue multiples (5-5.5x), but when Agent Force actually works at scale: “Every single Salesforce customer is going to want that product. Would you like this agent to automatically go after all the customers your team didn’t follow up with? Sign me the f— up.” The warning: Adobe is “the worst offender” for claiming $5B of “AI-influenced revenue” without net new bookings. “If you’re going to hide in your tower and say ‘we grew 8% but half was AI-influenced’—that’s table stakes.” “2025’s biggest failure was the co-pilot,” Jason said. “We’re not going to put it in our base product. We’re not going to make the core product better. But we’re not going to provide so much value that you want to pay for it. That was the cynical whiteboard of January 2025 that failed up and down the B2B board.” The counterexample? Notion. If they really hit 50% growth at $600M, the only explanation is customers paying $20/month instead of $10 for their AI offering. “I can’t use Notion without AI as a 10-year customer. It’s worth the 2x.” Very few B2B companies have earned that premium. Rory’s pick: Buy Google, short Nvidia. “If the capex cycle continues and we’re all still spending, Nvidia does fine. But unless they need continued acceleration… Google has upside if the capex tide goes out.” Jason’s counter: “You’re a fool to invest against Nvidia for 2026. There’s not enough time for competing GPUs and TPUs to get into data centers that don’t exist. 2027? I don’t know. But 2026—the bet’s still on.” Amazon is the underperformer candidate—only up 2% this year, and “there’s just not enough time” for their AI strategy to materialize. Here’s the prediction that should worry everyone: if unemployment ticks up 2-3 points for any reason—tariffs, business cycle, bank events—AI will take the blame. “All the AI executives talk about there will be an impact on unemployment,” Rory noted. “Politics doesn’t work by looking at BLS data by subgroup. All they’ll know is: unemployment’s ticked up, and those guys building AI are admitting the crime. They’re like, ‘We did it. We put you all out of a job.'” Jason agreed: “When there’s hard numbers at the top of the New York Times… it will become every dinner table conversation. Society will be terrified of AI.” The dark humor? “If the robots are going to take over society, I want to be sure that I own the robots.” “What was the biggest surprise of 2025? The three days when Windsurf was being bought by Cognition and I interviewed Varun the day before—are they being bought? Are they not? OpenAI was buying them and then they’re not—that was a bizarre moment.” “Nvidia investing $100 billion into OpenAI and the start of the circular deals… all of us giving up on caring about things like circular deals. We’ve all stopped caring. If it marks up my fund, great. It’s just the way it is now.” “Which companies go public in 2026? SpaceX, Canva, Databricks, Anthropic—four IPOs backloaded next year. OpenAI probably should have gone first, but it’s burning too much.” “The product of the year is Claude 3.5 or 3.7. Without this, we have no vibe coding. Without this, we have no Lovable, no Replit, no Cursor that really works. Many of these products existed for years. They did not work until Claude.” “What agents can do—we just started. Outside of parts of coding, we just started. We haven’t missed the boat as investors. We haven’t missed the boat.” “If the robots are going to take over society, I want to be sure that I own the robots.” “The entire convention on why people buy companies, how employees get treated, how much a human can be paid to do a job got thrown out of the window in the space of 6 months. Blew me away.” “Exits are the coin of the realm. The only fair way to measure things is: did you end up owning a lot and having big ownership in big exits?” “If the AI kind of lift starts to recede, they’ll all come down because they’re way over their long-term valuation. Pennies in front of steam wheels. Someone’s going to look up and say, ‘Oh my god, 70x… I should panic.'” This post is part of the ongoing 20VC x SaaStr collaboration.

New information has come to light about the canceled reboot of the classic spy game Perfect Dark, stating that the game had met significant development milestones, with entire chapters of motion capture recorded before Microsoft shelved the project. Joanna Dark’s voice was lent by Alix Wilton-Regan, who recently spoke in an interview with TheGamer and revealed that Perfect Dark Reboot’s development had been in the works for many years. Early recording sessions began in 2023, steadily increased in 2024, and continued until the game’s cancellation. Joanna Dark’s voice actor said, “To my knowledge, we were pretty far along. I’d done entire chapters of this universe.” She even mentioned that the game had completed several key developmental milestones, which Microsoft was pleased about. The Initiative Studio was developing Perfect Dark’s reboot in partnership with Crystal Dynamics under Xbox’s endorsement. The project was supposed to fill a void left by the absence of action-espionage games in recent years. However, that has changed with the release of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and the announcement of 007: First Light. The cancellation came as quite a shock to everyone. Wilton-Regan learned about it online, like the rest of the world, with no prior notice from Microsoft. She added: I was as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else was when the funding was pulled, and the studio was closed. I did not see it coming. I was absolutely blindsided when the project was defunded. It was devastating. So many people lost their jobs. An entire workforce was disbanded. This decision came out of the blue, leading to thousands of layoffs in the Xbox Games division and the closure of many Xbox-partner studios, such as The Initiative. However, leadership from The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics scoured for two months to secure new funding in a last-ditch effort. Interestingly, Wilton-Regan knew about these conversations and revealed that hope hadn’t died out for the Perfect Dark reboot, up until the last moment. She said: I couldn’t say too much about it because I knew The Initiative was in talks to keep Perfect Dark up and running in some shape or form. Possibly a slimmed-down version, possibly something slightly different. But certainly, everyone was working really hard behind the scenes to bring Perfect Dark back. And then one day, I heard from the creative director that the deal hadn’t gone through, and that really everything had fallen apart, and production was fully stopping.

Title: If You Like AMD’s Future, AMDY Lets You Go Full Send With An Over 100% Distribution Yield

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall Street The YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMDY) has captured investor attention with its extraordinary 101.88% distribution rate as of December 17, 2025. This isn’t a traditional dividend ETF – AMDY generates income by selling weekly call options on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock, collecting premiums from traders betting on AMD’s price movements. AMDY employs a covered call strategy, selling short-term call options against synthetic AMD exposure. The fund’s 101.88% distribution rate means investors theoretically receive more than their initial investment back annually through distributions. However, this assumes the most recent weekly distribution remains constant—a significant assumption given variable options premiums. The fund’s income depends entirely on AMD’s volatility. With a beta of 1.93, AMD moves nearly twice as much as the broader market, creating rich options premiums. AMD’s 52-week range of $76.48 to $267.08 illustrates this volatility—a 249% spread generating substantial options income. In 2025, AMD surged 76.7% through mid-December, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s 16.13% gain. This explosive performance drove elevated options premiums enabling AMDY’s triple-digit distribution rate. AMDY’s strategy caps upside participation. While AMD gained 76.7% in 2025, AMDY delivered a 53.9% price return—capturing approximately 70% of AMD’s appreciation. The fund sacrificed 23 percentage points of capital gains for its high distribution yield. More concerning is downside risk. AMD currently trades at $213.43, down 20% from its 52-week high of $267.08. During this decline, options premiums compress, reducing AMDY’s distribution potential. The fund offers no downside protection—if AMD falls 30%, AMDY’s net asset value falls approximately 30%, and declining volatility simultaneously reduces income generation. AMD’s business fundamentals support the bullish case underlying AMDY’s strategy. Third quarter 2025 revenue reached $9.25 billion, up 35.6% year-over-year, with operating cash flow of $2.16 billion. The company maintains $4.81 billion in cash against $3.87 billion in debt. Management recently announced a multiyear partnership with OpenAI expected to generate over $100 billion in revenue. However, AMD’s valuation leaves little room for disappointment. The stock trades at 112x trailing earnings, despite a more reasonable 35x forward multiple. Analysts maintain a consensus $282.82 price target, implying 32% upside—gains that AMDY holders would largely miss due to capped call positions. AMD pays no dividend, meaning AMDY’s distributions come entirely from options premiums. AMDY’s 101.88% distribution rate is not sustainable in its current form. This figure represents an annualized rate based on a single week’s distribution during elevated AMD volatility. As AMD’s price stabilizes or declines, options premiums will compress, reducing weekly distributions significantly. The fund’s 30-day SEC yield of just 1.15% provides a more conservative baseline. Investors should expect substantial distribution variability. During periods when AMD trades sideways or declines, weekly distributions may fall 50% or more from current levels. Investors seeking similar options-based income with different underlying exposure should consider the YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:NVDY). This fund applies the same covered call strategy to NVIDIA stock. NVDY offers exposure to a different segment of the AI semiconductor market, currently yielding approximately 80% through its options premium strategy. Like AMDY, NVDY caps upside potential while maintaining full downside exposure. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: 40 People Share The Most Disappointing, And Downright Rude Gifts They Ever Received At Work
URL: https://pleated-jeans.com/2025/12/22/people-share-the-most-disappointing-gifts-they-ever-received-at-work/
Time Published: 2025-12-22T14:04:09Z
Full Content:
Get ready to cringe and laugh as we unveil the tales of 40 people who received gifts at work that were more bewildering than wonderful. From thoughtlessly re-gifted items to presents that made them question their colleagues’ sanity, these stories of disappointing and downright rude gifts are a hilarious reminder that sometimes, it’s truly the thought that counts (or the lack thereof). Imagine unwrapping a box of expired chocolates, or finding a regifted pen with someone else’s name on it – these are just a sneak peek of the gift-giving blunders waiting inside. So, grab your popcorn and prepare for a journey through the wacky world of workplace gifting gone wrong. You’ll either be grateful for your considerate coworkers or find solace knowing you’re not alone in the office gift-giving Hall of Shame! My mom’s boss gave everyone a pen (a really cr*ppy, normal pen) with their names printed on normal white printer paper that was scotch taped down the side of the pen. This sounds made up even to me as I type it, but it’s still in our junk drawer. A small, nickel-sized, heart-shaped rock sent in the mail. It was supposed to represent their appreciation for the extra work during Covid. All I could think of was Charlie Brown trick or treating, “I got a rock.” Not me, but one year the company my brother works for gave each employee a CD of the owner playing Christmas songs on the harmonica. A letter from the CEO telling us how he is going to celebrate Christmas with his family up north to go skiing. That was all. Two free tickets to a cinema. The issue was that the closest cinema in that particular chain was about 800 miles away from me. That year the company decided it wasn’t going to provide basic office supplies for the break room. Coffee, tea, eating utensils, napkins, nothing. That year for Christmas we all got a brown paper bags fashioned like lunches. Inside was a metal straw, cloth napkin, a child sized set of plastic cutlery that fit in a travel case, a copy paste printed piece of paper with food puns in relation to our job, and a single fun sized hundred grand candy bar. This Fortune 500 company had over a billion in raw profit that year. Oh, and the cutlery ended up getting recalled due to some terrible forever chemicals in them. An email that only upper management would be getting the end of year bonus (sent to entire company by accident instead of just upper management). Then laid off 2 weeks into the new year. Found out from a friend in the company a little while later that the board of directors held a vote. They keep their car allowances at the expense of a wave of layoffs, or lose their car allowances and 10-15 people get to keep their jobs. Pretty sure it was unanimous. No matter how many times a company says you’re family, just remember that it’s the type of family that would gladly cut your throat to make sure the fat cats get to eat. – strike-when-ready Noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones. I’m sure they were good and useful to some people, but I’m legally deaf. We were told we were receiving our Christmas bonuses soon, and then we were all given a poinsettia. The poinsettia in itself wasn’t so bad, mine is actually still alive years later, but the fact that they had the audacity to call it a bonus was absurd. Jelly of the Month membership instead of my Christmas bonus. I wanted to put a pool in the backyard but nope. – inkyblinkypinkysue I was gifted a ham for the holidays…..I’m Jewish. Not me but a friend – all staff at the hospital received a kitchen scrubby for Christmas. Not even themed. Just random browns, greens, pinks, and yellows… seems like the boss bought dollar store multi-packs and opened them to give everyone one piece. Nurses Week 2022 (height of Delta wave COVID). We were given rocks on a keychain. The rock was engraved with the word “Hope”. We might have gotten some chapstick too. New owners this year. Old owner gave us 10% of our salary as a year end bonus. New guys gave us $100 amazon cards that were drained by the time we got them. Everyone was pissed but didn’t wanna say anything so I did. He asked everyone and they claimed to be delighted with their cards. Spineless bastards. Lmao. – dankasaurus710 Company coffee mug with the company name misspelled. It was a large company. Teacher here. One year, as our Christmas bonus, we got a defective plastic keychain that read “I love teching!” Spelled exactly like that. Normally, I’m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.. but after the s**t we had been through, with zero support from admin, s**t pay, disrespect, etc. the keychain set us all off. It was adding insult to injury. Like, not only is our “bonus” a keychain that didn’t even work (the hasp had no spring), but the spelling error meant that a) someone didn’t even check them when they arrived, and b) someone put them in every teacher mailbox without looking at them. Admin sent out an email that basically said turn your keychains back in so they could send them back and get corrected ones. So, adding insult to injury. I appreciated the sentiment, but all of us could’ve done without that. An ultra-religious self-help book so we could become less miserable, incompetent and immoral. During the pandemic, my partner’s company sent employees each an envelope through the mail with a sticker in it for some appreciation week I laughed so hard at that. It literally was a sticker that said “happy appreciation week”. A coin commemorating a billion dollars in sales. I was re-gifted a gift basket given to my boss by a client and he forgot to remove the card that was addressed to him. Starbucks gift card that had no money on it and they had no receipt for it. Not me but a coworker at last year’s raffle got a Nintendo DS cleaning kit. For a normal Nintendo DS, not even a 3DS. They aren’t being made anymore. A pack of 10 tissues at the onset of COVID. Expired food. My last job the company broke all sorts of financial records and gave everyone a very expensive glass thing with a decal of the refinery. Not only did it suck but all employees ended having to pay 75 dollars in taxes on it. So the ‘job well done’ cost 75 bucks. – Logic_rocks I used to work in a record shop in the UK and usually got a bottle of wine as a Christmas bonus. Then the company was bought by Virgin and our Christmas bonus was a copy of Richard Branson’s (Virgin’s CEO) autobiography. 5 dollar Subway gift card. My boss made me come in on an off day to pick up because, “she did not want me missing the company bonus”. I really wonder if our managers need how much was on the cards? We talked about it for months. A long sleeve denim shirt with the company logo in the front above one of the front pockets.. In Florida. Plus we couldn’t wear denim at work so the only time we’d be able to wear the company shirt is on our own time (not happening) or when we’d have dress down day (again not happening). When a coworker inquired where we could wear this since we can’t wear it to work they listed places (like a BBQ joint, the movies, etc.) and said we should be grateful since most places don’t give their employees gifts. It was a call center. Could’ve given a blanket (since it was cold in the center), travel mug, anything except a shirt we can’t wear. – jennabellie A compulsory invitation to the holiday party.

Investing Nvidia is still riding the AI story, and a recent Barclays upgrade to a buy rating thanks to the likelihood of more AI spending. Sending You to Google News in 3 © lupmotion / Shutterstock.com After gaining $6.85 on Friday, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up another $3.25 in premarket. The tech giant is still riding the AI story, and a recent Barclays upgrade to a buy rating, thanks to the likelihood of more AI spending. “We are OW as the company has long-term sustainable growth led by a large lead in GPUs for AI in DC, with further Edge opportunities (autos, robots, etc.) and a competitive moat around a large portion of the market,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC. Technically, after finding triple bottom support dating back to September, NVDA is now challenging resistance at its 50-day moving average. However, if it can break above that, which could happen today, we’d like to see NVDA retest $200 next. Plus, despite AI bubble fears, the global AI boom could grow from about $137 billion in 2022 to more than $1.81 trillion by 2030, as noted by Grand View Research. After gaining $12.37 on Friday, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is up another $4 in premarket. Technically, after finding strong support dating back to late November, AMD is just starting to pivot higher. From its last traded price of $213.43, we’d like to see it challenge its 50-day moving average at around $239.74. AMD is also just starting to pivot from oversold RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. Also fueling upside is optimism following AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su’s meeting with China’s Commerce Minister, where the two spoke about strengthening cooperation. On her second day of a China trip, Su exchanged views with MIIT head Li Lecheng on “strengthening cooperation in the digital economy and artificial intelligence sectors, according to a statement issued by MIIT, as reported by the South China Morning Post. After an explosive few days on earnings and guidance, Micron (NASDAQ: MU) is up another $10.45 a share in premarket. While Micron is becoming overbought after breaking above triple top resistance, analysts are arguing for more upside. Analysts at Rosenblatt, for example, have a $500 price target on MU with a buy rating, citing accelerating demand for memory and storage thanks to AI. As we noted the other day, Micron’s EPS of $4.78 beat by 82 cents. Revenue of $13.64 billion beat by $760 million. Moving forward, the company expects to earn between $8.22 and $8.62 per share, with revenue expected to be between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion for the second quarter. Analysts were looking for $4.78 per share on revenue of $14.3 billion. Fueling further upside, Micron says supply-demand issues could create a $100 billion high-bandwidth memory (HBM) market by 2028 – a milestone projected to arrive two years before the company’s previous outlook.

Title: Monthly Pay ETFs Go Mainstream And Retirees LOVE Them

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St I opened the conversation by admitting something most investors eventually confront. There are products in the market that sound intriguing, but you are not entirely sure how they work. Monthly pay ETFs fall squarely into that category for many people. Lee stepped in to explain why they have quietly become one of the most useful income tools available today. Lee started with the basics. Exchange traded funds trade intraday, unlike traditional open-end mutual funds that settle at the end of the day. What surprised many income investors over the past decade is that while most ETFs originally paid dividends quarterly, a growing group now pays monthly. For retirees, boomers, and older Gen X investors, that distinction matters far more than it sounds. Lee pointed to JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) Equity Premium Income ETF, symbol JEPI, as the most widely recognized example. With roughly $30 billion in assets, JEPI pays a monthly yield north of 8%. While it does experience some volatility during broader market drawdowns, Lee noted that income-focused investors continue to support it because consistent cash flow is the primary objective. We also discussed more specialized options. One that stood out was the Gabelli Gold, Natural Resources & Income Trust (NYSE: GGN). Managed by Mario Gabelli’s firm, it holds a mix of gold and energy stocks, effectively pairing two sectors that often perform well during inflationary or volatile environments. GGN pays a monthly dividend above 8%, making it attractive for investors who want sector exposure alongside income. Another higher-yield option Lee mentioned was BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II (NYSE: BSTZ), a technology-oriented income fund paying monthly distributions exceeding 11%. These types of funds are not designed for ultra-conservative investors, but for those willing to accept some volatility, the income potential can be compelling. Lee emphasized that monthly pay ETFs are particularly well suited for boomers and Gen X investors nearing retirement. They are not replacements for Treasury bonds or insured products, but they serve as powerful income complements. Even investors who do not currently need the income can reinvest monthly dividends, taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging. When prices dip, reinvested dividends buy more shares, enhancing long-term income potential. We agreed that monthly pay ETFs are one of the most practical innovations in income investing over the past decade. They combine liquidity, yield, and flexibility in a way traditional dividend stocks and mutual funds often cannot. Whether used to fund living expenses or to compound income over time, they give investors another way to turn portfolios into cash-flow engines. [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there’s something out that I don’t even know how it works, but you do. It’s monthly pay ETFs. Tell me about them, I’m not familiar. [00:00:13] Lee Jackson: Well, everybody is probably pretty familiar with the exchange traded fund now and the way they vary from the old opened end mutual fund, exchange traded funds, trade on the major exchanges and they’re, you can buy and sell ’em anytime during the day when you want, at any price. [00:00:31] It doesn’t matter. Whereas when you wanna sell your Vanguard, open-end mutual fund, you may have to call Vanguard and sell and you’ll get the end of the day price. Yeah. But, one of the things that we found out and I was intrigued by, ’cause I’ve written about dividend and dividend paying stocks at, 24/7 for almost 15 years, is that most of these ETFs paid like mutual funds. [00:00:55] They pay quarterly. But in the last 10, 8, 10 years, they started to have ETFs that paid monthly. And think of that if you’re a boomer, an older, gen X person getting, what Better to supplement your passive income. And remember, passive income is income. that the IRS views, it’s anything from your job. [00:01:19] So if you have stocks or bonds or real estate or things like that that generate income, that’s passive income. Well, some of the really good ones that we like, and one of the biggest ones is it’s got $30 billion in it, is run by JP Morgan and it’s the, symbol on it is JEPI. It pays about an eight 15% yield monthly. [00:01:43] Wow. Monthly and you know it ha has it gone up and down a little bit? Did it go down a little bit, when we had the draw down in late October and November? Yeah, but then it came right back. ’cause who doesn’t want an eight 40 or eight 50, whatever it is, dividend monthly with, I mean, is there risk? Sure, because it is, it’s not a treasury bond yielding 3.8%. [00:02:07] It’s yielding 8.3% or whatever it is. That’s a good one. Another one we like and this is especially interesting if it’s people that are wanting a sector play, is, the Gabelli Gamco trust, symbol. GGN. Yeah. All, it holds is gold stocks. And energy stocks, so that’s almost your perfect Paris trade in one. [00:02:33] You’ve got the red hot gold stocks, which Goldman Sachs thinks exceed 4,900 next year, and then it has all of the quality energy stocks, but it pays monthly. The dividend on GGN is in the eight plus percent range. It’s run by Mario Gabelli’s company. He’s been on wall team for 50 years. So that’s a good shot to take. [00:02:57] Another good one that we like it’s, the symbol is BSTZ and it’s sort of a income related technology play, but the, again, the dividends monthly, it’s about 11.2%. And again, these aren’t for people that are very, very, very conservative. All the JP Morgan one you could go with, it’s, that’s pretty good. Very conservative, really all, and they all use big, they write covered calls on their positions. The stocks go up, they get called away, they replace it with another stock or buy the stock again. But I think for boomers, gen X people that are steering towards retirement, these are the perfect adjuncts to social security, pension funds, IRA distributions, anything like that. every bill that you have to pay for the most part comes monthly. Your car payment or your mortgage payment doesn’t come every quarter, comes every single month. [00:04:01] And what better way to augment income with passive income? And these are good, good ideas and we constantly write about this. So if you keep checking on, 24/7 Wall Street, you’ll see our ideas, I mean, we have so many good writers covering this now, [00:04:18] we probably have 10 guys and gals that are covering the exchange traded fund, income stocks. So they’re a good way to generate money. And, again, if you don’t need the income, if you don’t need the income, you can reinvest your dividends. [00:04:33] Just go to your broker and say, I wanna reinvest these every month. So if, it goes up a little bit and you’re reinvesting, you won’t buy as much. But if it does go down, like the draw down we had in October and November, you’ll buy more shares. So either way, just remember it. It’s like the dream investment for boomers, the monthly pay etf.

Title: AMZU Let’s You Bet 200% On Amazon But That Doesn’t Mean You Should

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Direxion Daily AMZN Bull 2X Shares (NYSEARCA:AMZU) offers 200% daily exposure to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but its mechanics reveal why it’s designed for short-term traders, not income investors. Understanding how AMZU generates distributions and its structural risks is critical before investing. AMZU doesn’t generate income through traditional dividends. It uses derivatives, swaps, and daily rebalancing to achieve 200% exposure to Amazon’s daily price movements. When Amazon pays a dividend, AMZU receives the distribution amplified through leverage, but at significant cost. The ETF paid a $1.20 special dividend in December 2025, but this must be evaluated against substantial NAV erosion from volatility decay. The fund holds only 13.57% in direct Amazon equity, with the remainder in derivatives for daily 2x leverage. This structure resets leverage daily, creating compounding drag that destroys long-term returns even when the underlying stock performs well. While Amazon declined 1.64% over the past year, AMZU lost 23.15% – nearly 20 percentage points beyond what 2x leverage predicts. The S&P 500 gained 12.63% and the Nasdaq-100 surged 20.70% over the same period. Year-to-date through December 2025, Amazon gained 3.63%, which should theoretically produce a 7.26% return for AMZU. Instead, the fund lost 13.99% – a 21-percentage-point shortfall from volatility decay. This occurs because daily resets lock in losses during choppy markets. When Amazon drops 2% one day and rises 2% the next, AMZU doesn’t return to breakeven due to compounding effects. Recent volatility illustrates the problem. In December 2025, Amazon experienced multiple 3-4% daily swings, with intraday ranges exceeding $7. On December 17, the stock dropped 4.4%. These moves amplify decay as AMZU rebalances derivatives at the worst times. While AMZU’s $1.20 special dividend might seem attractive, total return matters more. High yield means nothing if the ETF price collapses. Since inception in September 2022, AMZU has consistently underperformed its theoretical 2x target during volatile periods. Amazon’s fundamentals remain strong—Q3 2025 revenue of $180.2 billion and net income of $21.2 billion both beat estimates. AWS sales grew 20%, and the company maintains 24.3% return on equity with a healthy balance sheet. However, these positives don’t translate to AMZU performance due to daily resets. The ETF’s $321.5 million in assets and limited three-year track record provide insufficient data for long-term distribution patterns. The structure guarantees volatility will erode returns over extended periods, making dividend sustainability irrelevant when capital losses exceed income received. For leveraged technology exposure without single-stock concentration risk, ProShares UltraPro QQQ (NASDAQ:TQQQ) offers better diversification. TQQQ provides 3x daily exposure to the Nasdaq-100 Index, including Amazon alongside 99 other leading technology companies. TQQQ generates income from dividends across the entire Nasdaq-100. The fund’s $24 billion asset base and track record since 2010 provide more reliable performance data. While TQQQ still suffers from volatility decay inherent to leveraged ETFs, diversification across 100 stocks creates smoother daily movements than AMZU’s single-stock concentration. For tactical traders seeking short-term leveraged exposure, TQQQ’s broader base and deeper liquidity make it more practical than betting 200% on Amazon alone.

Title: AI layoffs in 2025: Over 55,000 US job cuts are linked to arrival of artificial intelligence – here's list of companies

Layoffs have been a major concern in the job market in 2025 as several major companies announced significant job cuts amid the growing use of artificial intelligence. This year alone, AI has led to almost 55,000 layoffs in the US, according to a report by CNBC citing consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. In 2025, total job cuts reached 1.17 million, the highest since 2020, when 2.2 million layoffs were announced. US employers reported 153,000 job cuts in October, and over 71,000 cuts occurred in November, with AI responsible for more than 6,000 of these layoffs, the report said. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a report in November, noting that AI can already replace 11.7% of the US labour market and save up to $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and other professional services. However, some experts disagree that AI is the primary cause of the significant job cuts. Fabian Stephany, an assistant professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, previously told CNBC that it could be just an excuse. Stephany mentioned that many companies which did well during the pandemic “significantly overhired," and the recent layoffs could simply be a “market clearance”. “It’s to some extent firing people that for whom there had not been a sustainable long-term perspective and instead of saying ‘we miscalculated this two, three years ago, they can now come to the scapegoating, and that is saying ‘it’s because of AI though,’” he added. Check out the companies that announced AI-linked layoffs — The tech giant announced its largest-ever layoffs, cutting 14,000 corporate jobs to focus on its “biggest bets”, including AI. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before... we’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote in a blog post. Microsoft has cut around 15,000 jobs by 2025, with its latest announcement in July signalling 9,000 roles to be eliminated. In a memo to employees, CEO Satya Nadella emphasised that the company must' reimagine” its mission for a new era' and highlighted the importance of AI for the company's future, the report noted. “What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It’s not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It’s about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That’s the shift we are driving — from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organisation to build whatever they need to achieve,” Nadella was quoted as saying. In September, CEO Marc Benioff announced that the company had laid off 4,000 customer support staff, utilising AI, the report said. “I’ve reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000, because I need less heads,” Benioff said in an interview on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast. Benioff stated over the summer that AI was already managing up to 50% of the company's work. CEO Arvind Krishna told the Wall Street Journal earlier this year that AI chatbots had replaced the jobs of a few hundred human resources workers. Unlike other companies, which cited AI as a reason for job cuts, Krishna, however, noted that the firm had increased hiring in other areas that required more critical thinking, such as software engineering, sales, and marketing. The company announced a 1% reduction in its global workforce in November, which is expected to affect approximately 3,000 employees. Crowdstrike announced in May that it is laying off 5% of its staff, amounting to 500 employees, citing AI as the direct reason for the cuts. “AI has always been foundational to how we operate,” the report quoted co-founder and CEO George Kurtz's memo. “AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster. It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office. AI is a force multiplier throughout the business.” Human resources platform Workday in February announced it would cut 8.5% of its workforce, roughly 1,750 jobs, as the company increases its investment in AI. Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach stated that the layoffs were necessary to focus on AI investments and to free up resources.

Title: Quite a few of the AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were actually ex-employees

20% of AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were ex-employees When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Google is re-hiring a number of ex-employees to help boost its AI strategy, a new CNBC report states, claiming one in five AI software engineer hires were so-called 'boomerang' employees. Not only is this figure up from previous years, but Google also claims to be hiring more workers from rival companies (like Microsoft, Amazon and Apple) than ever before. "We're energized by our momentum, compute and talent – engineers want to work here to keep building groundbreaking products," a company spokesperson shared. Data published by ADP Research confirms 'boomerang' hiring, where companies regain former assets (including from periods spent at rival companies), is on the rise, and has been since 2022. This trend is amplified within the information sector, while other sections like leisure and hospitality, health and construction see fewer returning employees. Google also has a large pool of alumni to pick from after cutting around 12,000 workers in early 2023, plus hundreds more in smaller rounds of layoffs. When ChatGPT hit the ground running in November 2022, rival companies like Google were left stunned, but recent years have seen Google in particular step up to the mark. The company recently launched Gemini 3, and with it "a new era of intelligence." The Gemini app now has 650 million monthly users, but it still lags behind OpenAI's 800 million weekly ChatGPT users. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Still, investors are happy with the work Google is doing. Company shares are up 62% this year to date. On the flip side, Google isn't the only company poaching AI talent. Apple recently announced that 16-year Google veteran Amar Subramanya would be joining Apple as VP of AI following John Giannandrea's departure.

Title: I was laid off by Oracle 2 years ago and still can't find a job. I've blown through my savings and now sell antiques to stay afloat.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This "as-told-to" essay is based on a conversation with Clair Todd, a 40-year-old job seeker from New Hampshire, who worked as a site reliability engineer for Oracle until being laid off in 2023. Business Insider has verified her employment with documentation. This essay has been edited for length and clarity. I started at Oracle in January 2020 as a site reliability engineer. In November 2023, I started hearing that my Oracle coworkers were getting pulled into Zoom meetings and told they had been laid off. I hoped I wouldn't be next, but I was. My entire team was let go. I didn't start looking for work right away because I'd received some severance pay, and I'd heard it was difficult to land a tech role during the holiday season. I took some time to reassess what I wanted from my career and began my job search in February 2024. I was optimistic at first because most of my prior job searches hadn't taken too long. As the months dragged on, it became clear I had the wrong impression of the tech hiring landscape. More than two years after being laid off, I'm still unemployed.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When I was let go from Oracle, my severance, unemployment benefits, and my emergency fund helped for a while. After going through more than $50,000 in savings, I'm now in a tougher position. I earn between $500 and $1,000 a month by reselling antiques I find and refurbish, including old instruments, electronics, and collectibles that I purchase on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. It's a huge drop from the roughly $5,500 a month I used to take home at Oracle. In addition to my mortgage, I have about $45,000 in student debt I need to pay off. I'm covering my mortgage and bills by dipping into savings and selling stocks when necessary. When my washer and dryer broke last year, I had to buy a new set on a payment plan — something I'd never done before. In the past, I would've just paid for it outright. Throughout the year, Business Insider has spoken with people who've worked at some of the world's most high-profile companies and found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations.

Read more on the topic: In my early 30s, I decided to go back to school and pursue a bachelor's degree. I had spent most of my career in sales and customer service roles, but I didn't see a path to earning the kind of income I wanted. I was still living in a small apartment, and I wanted to own a home someday. When I started thinking seriously about a career change, tech was the obvious choice. My dad, mom, and brother all worked in the field, so it felt like I'd be joining the family business. In 2015, I began pursuing a bachelor's degree in information technology. After graduating in 2018, I landed a software engineering role at a small tech firm. I left that position later that year to take on a quality assurance engineering role at Hitachi Vantara. I took the role because I saw it as a great opportunity, but the downside was that I lived three hours away from the office. The long hours on the road quickly took a toll. At the end of 2019, I accepted my former remote position at Oracle, a role I landed after receiving an employee referral. My pivot to tech gave me the income I needed to buy my first home. However, after being laid off and struggling to find work, I've sometimes wondered whether it was worthwhile. My job search has been challenging because I'm looking for midlevel roles, and a lot of the positions I've seen appear to be targeting either senior-level or entry-level candidates. I've also been targeting competitive remote roles due to a health situation I'm navigating, which makes it difficult for me to commute or work from an office. I've had several interviews, but I haven't been able to secure an offer. The technical interviews have been challenging. In one interview, it felt like I was on "Jeopardy!" because I was being asked what felt like software engineering trivia questions, and most of them didn't seem relevant to the actual role. My family warned me that layoffs are fairly common in tech and that I should be prepared. I built a "just-in-case" savings fund over the years, but there's not much left. A few months ago, after more than a year of searching for work, I decided to stop actively looking for employment and focus on building a website development business. I would like to return to tech, but I need time to recover from the difficult process of applying and getting repeatedly rejected. I also worried that being out of the workforce for so long made it even harder to land a job, so I figured it was wise to start my business as a backup plan. My business is still in its early stages and isn't generating income yet, which is one reason I spend time reselling goods. It's been challenging mentally because it feels like you're not good enough when you keep getting rejected. On top of that, you have to worry about paying the bills without money coming in. I don't want to say I've given up, but my search has been extremely discouraging. I'm also not as passionate about tech as I used to be, which is kind of a shame because I was so excited to get my degree and work in the field. If I hadn't been let go by Oracle, it probably would've been a different story. Before I scaled back my job search, I'd started focusing less on Big Tech jobs and more on roles at smaller businesses and startups. The interview process at these companies felt more human, and I was more likely to get updates on my applications — even if it was just a polite rejection. If I re-enter the job market, I think I'd definitely focus on smaller companies rather than large corporations. Jump to

Title: Why Nvidia maintains its moat and Gemini won’t kill OpenAI

UPDATED 16:07 EST / DECEMBER 21 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante and David Floyer Two prevailing narratives have driven markets recently. The first is that Nvidia Corp.’s moat is eroding primarily thanks to graphics processing unit alternatives such as tensor processing units and other application-specific integrated circuits. The second is that Google LLC generally and its Gemini artificial intelligence model specifically is gaining share, will dominate AI search and ultimately beat OpenAI Group PBC. We believe both of these propositions are overstated and unlikely to materialize as currently envisioned by many. Specifically, our research indicates that Nvidia’s GB300 and the follow on Vera Rubin will completely reset the economics of AI, conferring continued advantage to Nvidia. Furthermore, Nvidia’s volume lead will make it the low cost producer and, by far, the most economical platform to run AI at scale – for both training and inference. As it pertains to Google, it faces, in our view, the ultimate innovator’s dilemma because its search is tightly linked to advertising revenue. If Google moves its advertising model to a chatbot-like experience, its cost to serve search queries goes up by 100 times. The alternative is to shift its business model toward a more integrated shopping experience. But this requires more than 10 blue links thrown at users. Rather, it mandates a new trust compact with its users and advertisers, which Google does not currently possess, even with Gemini’s recent success. Despite the criticisms of ChatGPT, OpenAI in our estimation is well on the way to disrupting today’s online experience by emphasizing trusted information over pushing ads. The bottom line is the two early catalyzers of the AI era, Nvidia and OpenAI remain in a strong position in our view. Though lots can change, the current narrative around these two firms is likely to change when GB300 adoption ramps. In this, our 300th Breaking Analysis, we set forth our thinking around what we believe is a misplaced narrative in the market. We’ll explain what we think the market is missing and why Nvidia’s forthcoming product lineup will reset the narrative. We’ll also look at the economics of search, large language models and chatbots and share why OpenAI, while facing many challenges (competition, commitments, uncertainty), is in a stronger position than many have posited; and why Google, though clearly a leader in AI, remains challenged to preserve what may be the greatest business in the history of the technology business. We believe the core issue with TPUs isn’t whether they’re “good” chips — they are. The issue in our view is broad-based architectural fit for the next phase of AI, where frontier-scale workloads are increasingly communication-heavy and bandwidth-hungry and require systems that can scale to very large clusters without collapsing under their own coordination overhead. In our assessment, TPUs were designed in an era when bandwidth was expensive and hard to deliver, and that design center shows up as models scale and workloads diversify. TPUs are well-suited for lower-bandwidth AI and have proven effective in production contexts such as search. They can do certain training well, and they’ve been associated with important early milestones. But as models get larger and the work becomes more distributed, our research indicates the TPU design runs into practical constraints on expansion and on the amount of bandwidth available within the architecture. In our view, that’s a key reason the TPU approach hasn’t become the broadly replicated blueprint across the industry. We believe leading frontier efforts increasingly demand an architecture optimized for high bandwidth and scale — the kind of system design that enables “GPU factories,” where very large numbers of accelerators can be connected and kept productively utilized. When we talk about the requirements for AI factories, we highlight below three key factors: In our view, architectures designed around higher-bandwidth, scalable interconnects are better aligned with those requirements. Our premise is that TPUs remain a single-vendor architecture with a topology that effectively forms pods — a tightly coupled unit presented as a single system. That approach was elegant for its time and echoed other historic designs (for example IBM Blue Gene, Cray) intended to solve the “how do we connect everything” problem. But we believe the limitations show up in two places: None of this makes TPUs irrelevant. In our opinion, TPUs remain extremely useful and attractive — particularly for more bounded workloads — but usefulness is not the same thing as being the dominant foundation for next-generation AI factories. And in our framework, it’s definitely not the platform that will erode Nvidia’s moat. We believe the popular storyline — “Model X is trained on TPUs, therefore TPUs are the future” — misses the reality. Our view is that some major model training has indeed leveraged TPUs, but the data points toward a mixed approach where GPU-class architectures become increasingly necessary for frontier-scale, communication-heavy work. Our research indicates there’s also a pragmatic factor. Specifically, when accelerators are constrained, it’s rational to push existing assets to their limits. In that context, using available TPUs aggressively is not a statement that TPUs are the end state — it’s an optimization under supply constraints. We’re not bearish on TPUs. They are mature, and the engineering behind them is impressive. But we believe Nvidia’s moat is reinforced by an end-to-end architecture designed for bandwidth, scale, and sustained utilization — the attributes that matter most as AI factories move from impressive single-system demos to large-scale production infrastructure. We believe the recent TPU enthusiasm is less about a structural shift away from Nvidia and more about the fact that volumes are constrained, demand is outstripping supply, and every hyperscaler is operating under scarcity. In this environment, buyers and builders will use whatever credible compute they can get — and that dynamic is amplifying the availability and capabilities of TPUs, as well as other alternatives. The biggest constraint our research points to right now is packaging capacity. CoWoS (chip-on-wafer-on-substrate) is a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. packaging technology that takes chiplets from the wafer and integrates them onto a substrate so they can be connected with very high-speed communication. In our view, this is foundational to modern AI systems that depend on fast movement between chips and across complex multichip architectures. The key point is that when CoWoS capacity is tight, it constrains the output of advanced AI accelerators regardless of how strong demand is. The chart above shows projected consumption across Nvidia, Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and others — and importantly, it reflects all chips, not only AI chips. That matters because portions of the non-Nvidia consumption are serving other product categories and process needs. But the bottom line remains that AI chips are being governed by the same packaging bottleneck. In the data referenced, total CoWoS capacity expands materially over time with Nvidia locking up more than 60% of the volume: At the same time, the compute and system efficiency of the leading platforms improves as Nvidia transitions through architectural steps — from GB200 to GB300 and then Rubin — alongside improvements in switching and overall system design. In our opinion, the market should view these trends in tandem – that is, capacity increases, but so does the performance per system, which reinforces the economics for the vendors that can both secure volume and move fastest down the experience curve. The leading vendor, by far, in this scenario is Nvidia. We believe one of the most underappreciated points in the current narrative is that Nvidia has effectively pre-bought and securured meaningful CoWoS capacity. As a result, even as the pie expands, Nvidia is positioned to maintain significant share over the planning horizon discussed — with the projection that by 2027 it still holds roughly 61% of the referenced market. For AI chips specifically our estimate is that Nvidia will maintain closer to ~80% of the market. Our view is that share will be determined by unit economics. Our premise is that Nvidia has volume leadership and has locked up a critical bottleneck input, which will confer structural cost advantage and flywheel effects to the company. In a supply constrained environment, hyperscalers will pursue a blended strategy. In the case of Google, it will use TPUs where they fit, and GPUs where they’re required, to generally maximize access to any capable compute. We believe that’s what’s driving much of the current TPU buzz — not a belief that TPUs will broadly displace GPUs for frontier-scale, communication-heavy workloads. We also believe it’s unlikely that a major hyperscaler (Google in this case) will broadly sell its proprietary accelerators to direct competitors in a way that creates a real external market. Claims and rumors may circulate, but in our opinion the more plausible driver behind “TPUs in the wild” narratives is ecosystem pressure from partners (for example Broadcom) and Meta Platforms Inc. (looking for any advantage right now). In short, we don’t see this as a strategic decision by Google to become a true merchant silicon provider. We believe the most important takeaway from this segment is the connection between the following three factors: In our view, this combination positions Nvidia, with near term platforms like GB300 and especially Rubin, to become the low-cost producers of tokens versus alternatives — not simply because of peak performance claims, but because scale and secured capacity will translate into superior economics. We believe the market is in a phase where every credible AI vendor can sell everything they can build because supply is scarce. But our research indicates this will change as capacity catches up over the next couple of years. Historically, semiconductors tend to swing from undersupply to oversupply — timing this is hard, but our research suggests there is still meaningful runway, and that the near-term (including 2026) remains supply-constrained rather than surplus-driven. Net-net: TPUs are getting attention because the market supply is short. CoWoS is a core bottleneck. And Nvidia’s ability to lock up capacity and ride the experience curve reinforces both share and cost position as the cycle matures. In a recent investor podcast, Gavin Baker went deep into the economics of GPUs and TPUs. It’s worth listening to the entire conversion. We pulled a clip from that discussion, which succinctly articulates the pending economic shift coming in the near term. What follows is our assessment of that conversation blended with our premise: We believe the “low-cost producer” framing is critical, but it’s often misunderstood and not applied rigorously. In our view, being the low-cost producer has always mattered in scaled markets — the nuance is whether people mean unit cost, delivered price or economic margin structure. When viewed through that perspective, Google’s position as the current low-cost producer for AI chips is increasingly fragile as the stack shifts and as the economics of TPU/ASIC supply chains become more clear. Our research aligns with Gavin Baker’s narrative, which indicates Google has enjoyed meaningful cost advantages in parts of its AI stack and has leaned into that position by aggressively approaching the market. Google can “bomb” AI with low-cost capacity because when you can drive lower unit costs, you can push more supply into the market and press competitors on price and availability. But we believe that advantage is highly dependent on the underlying performance curve and the economics of the hardware supply chain — and both are moving. We believe one under-appreciated structural advantage for Nvidia is the learning loop created when a major deployment runs infrastructure at extreme scale. In our view, large-scale Blackwell deployments — particularly the kind of “push it to the limits” rollout that X.ai is driving — act as a forcing function that exposes bugs, tightens systems performance and accelerates resilience. Nvidia learns from this and then propagates those learnings across its customer base, which translates into a time-to-market advantage that is difficult for alternatives to match unless Nvidia stumbles operationally. In our opinion, this dynamic will compound as scale finds issues faster, fixes get distributed broadly and the platform improves as more customers run it in production-like conditions. Gemini 3, as Baker points out, has demonstrated the scaling laws are still working. Our research indicates that, if scaling continues to pay off, then the market’s center of gravity shifts toward whoever can deliver the most training and inference work per dollar, per watt and per unit time — at scale. That’s where Nvidia’s roadmap is positioned to reassert its dominance as GB300’s are drop-in-compatible with GB200. The delta from Hopper to Blackwell was nontrivial. We’ve previously reported the lower reliability of GB200-based racks due new cooling requirements, rack densities and the overall complexity of the transition. But early reports suggest GB300-based configurations at neoclouds are performing exceptionally well with low friction for upgrades from GB200-based infrastructure. This compatibility accelerates deployment velocity, and improves the probability that customers stay on the Nvidia upgrade path rather than detouring into architectural forks. And the economics favor Nvidia. We believe the economics of the TPU/ASIC stack are often overlooked. A critical constraint is if a large portion of value accrues to a supplier (for example Broadcom as Google’s ASIC partner), then the “low-cost producer” claim becomes more complicated. Gavin Baker estimates at scale, roughly $15 billion of Google’s $30 billion TPU revenue goes to Broadcom, which eats a major share of the margin pool. Baker used a simply analogy that Google is like the architect and Broadcom is the builder – it manages the TSMC relationship. He correctly points out that Apple has taken control of both the front-end design and all the back-end work, including managing TSMC, because at its scale, that level of vertical integration makes sense. This dynamic puts pressure on Google’s behavior over time. Even if TPU unit economics look attractive in isolation, the supplier margin structure can erode the sustained ability to undercut the market — especially as Nvidia’s performance-per-system improves. Baker stated that the OpEx for Broadcom’s entire semi division is $5 billion, so at scale, Google paying Broadcom $15 billion may become less attractive. We believe the roadmap implication is that GB300 will reset the cost curve and Rubin extends it again, the space between Nvidia and TPU/ASIC alternatives increases dramatically. In our opinion, that doesn’t make TPUs irrelevant; it makes them situational. As Nvidia’s platform becomes a lower-cost token producer at scale, alternatives are forced into narrower lanes or into “use what you have” strategies. This topic is reminiscent of a battle in the disk drive business in the 1980s. Seagate was a leading manufacturer of hard drives at the time and pursued a vertically integrated strategy, manufacturing its own heads, media and the drives themselves. In the 1980’s, Quantum was struggling with manufacturing quality but revived its business by outsourcing production to MKE, a world-class Japanese-based manufacturer. Though this required tight engineering coordination between designers and manufacturing, it addressed Quantum’s “back-end” challenges. Quantum began to gain share rapidly and its stock price rose. This author, in a conversation with industry legend Al Shugart, CEO of Seagate, asked if this was a new business model that had merit. Shugart said simply, “When you have to pay someone to make your product, you make less.” He further intimated that long-term, when the industry consolidated, he would be the last man standing. At the time there were around 80 hard drive manufacturers. Today there are three, with Seagate the most valuable. There’s a tight linkage between silicon and models. In this next section we move further up the stack and examine the recent narrative around Google, Gemini and OpenAI. Our research indicates the competitive battle is moving up the stack. Thoough there’s excitement about the rapid improvement in model capability — and we believe larger, more complete models will continue to emerge as AI factories ramp — a key strategic premise of ours is that model quality alone won’t be the enduring differentiator. In our view, the center of gravity shifts to: As laid out above, even if Google can claim periods of cost advantage today, we believe Nvidia’s platform learnings, drop-in upgrade path and performance roadmap — combined with the margin realities embedded in TPU supply chains — shift the “low-cost producer” advantage back toward Nvidia over the next two cycles and likely beyond. We believe it’s fair to say Gemini 3 has had a meaningful impact on the AI conversation, particularly in reinforcing that scaling laws remain intact. But we also believe some of the widely circulated charts — especially those implying ChatGPT is “leveling off” while Gemini is “exploding” — are potentially misleading if they’re used as a proxy for durable competitive advantage or for what matters most economically. Our view is that user growth charts are easy to over-interpret because they compress very different distribution mechanics into a single line. A product can appear to “explode” in monthly active users from bundling, defaults, integration points or placement — while another can appear to “flatten” even as usage quality, monetization and ecosystem affinity remain strong. The data suggests there’s more nuance here than the headline narrative implies. The more important factor, in our opinion, is that Alphabet’s economic center of gravity is still advertising — particularly Search and related advertising properties. As shown below, Google generates an enormous amount of operating profit from advertising, with very large operating margins. Cloud, though meaningful in absolute dollars and improving in profitability, is still minor relative to the scale of Search-driven operating profit. Even at rising operating margin levels, the cloud business is small compared with the hundreds of billions in operating profit and cash generation tied to the advertising machine. And the “Other Bets” category is economically immaterial in the context of the overall profit engine. Google has arguably the world’s best technology marketplace in the form of Search — extraordinary query volume, an unparalleled advertising monetization model and a highly efficient compute foundation that reinforces profitability. The system works, and it works at massive scale. The dilemma, in our view, is how Google migrates from that dominant model to something “more complete” without undermining the profit engine that made it dominant in the first place. The data suggests the challenge is not whether Google can build strong AI models — it clearly can. The challenge is whether it can evolve the product and business model of Search in a way that preserves economics while moving toward a new interaction paradigm. Our strategic questions for Google are: Gemini’s momentum is impressive, but we believe the larger story is economic and structural. Google’s strength in search creates the very dilemma it has to solve to lead the next phase. We believe the earlier monthly active user charts tell an incomplete story that can be misleading if used to infer leadership or monetization power. The more instructive view is engagement as shown above. Specifically, the SimilarWeb data shows user minutes on the web — because time spent is a better proxy for intensity of use, dependency, and ultimately monetizable opportunity. ChatGPT maintains a meaningful lead in user minutes, even as Gemini is growing quickly. The chart also shows fast growth from other entrants (for example DeepSeek and Grok), but in our view the competitive reality remains concentrated and it’s primarily a two-horse race for the bulk of user attention between ChatGPT and Gemini. The key metric is not only “who is growing,” but who is capturing time. We believe the implications become more acute when you overlay Google’s economic model. Google’s profit engine is built on advertising monetization tied to search behavior — high volume, low marginal cost and well-optimized conversion funnels. That machine depends on serving an enormous number of ad opportunities efficiently. But if the interaction model shifts toward ChatGPT-style experiences — richer answers, longer sessions and more compute-heavy responses — the cost structure changes dramatically. Our research indicates each unit of engagement in an assistant-style model is materially more compute-intensive than the classic search model. The point made above is for a comparable “user minute,” the assistant model can consume on the order of ~10 times more compute resources to generate substantially richer output for the end user. In our view, this is the crux of why merging an AI assistant interaction model with an ad-funded business model is not trivial: So although an AI-native interface may create a more compelling product, it also risks turning the economics of ad delivery from a high-margin machine into a heavier-cost model — unless monetization mechanics evolve to compensate. We believe user minutes is a better metric than MAUs, but it still doesn’t fully capture the true shift. Time spent doesn’t directly measure the quantity and richness of knowledge being produced and delivered into the market — and that richness is precisely what drives the compute intensity. The bottom line is engagement is the right metric, but the deeper point is economic. If the market moves from low-cost search interactions to compute-heavy assistant interactions, the cost to serve — and therefore the cost to monetize — rises sharply. That’s the pressure point for Google’s ad-dominated business model in our view. We believe a common refrain — “Google will just disrupt itself” — ignores the single most important constraint in that the economics of search are uniquely favorable to Google, and moving from classic search to an assistant-style interaction model changes the unit economics in a way that can break the profit engine. Our research indicates the cost of a search is a fraction of a cent. That outcome is the product of: In our view, this is arguably the cheapest large-scale compute service in the world, and among the best-operated at global scale. The point is that revenue per search is ~five times to 10 times the gross margin on the cost of the search itself. That’s the heart of the extraordinary business model Google has built – ultra-low unit cost paired with a monetization engine that extracts high value per interaction. In our opinion, you don’t casually disrupt a model with those economics — not because you lack vision, but because the alternative must clear a very high economic bar. Our research indicates the nature of search queries supports these economics: This is a high-volume, low-complexity workload. It is optimized for speed, efficiency and monetization — not for generating richly reasoned outputs. Our central claim is that if Google converts this ultra-cheap interaction into an OpenAI-style experience — richer responses, longer sessions, higher compute per interaction — the cost structure rises sharply. If cost per “search” increases by an order of magnitude while monetization mechanics remain in the old ad model, the economics compress and the business model can break. The bottom line is Google can absolutely innovate, but the data indicates self-disruption is economic surgery. The existing search machine is optimized around simplicity and margin. Shifting to compute-intensive assistant behavior without a new monetization model risks collapsing the very engine that funds the transition. The debate about whether Google can disrupt itself becomes much clearer when you model cost per session rather than looking at top-line user counts. As indicated, the economics of classic Google search are engineered around extremely low cost per interaction and very high-margin monetization. Assistant-style sessions invert that equation. Our research indicates the cost per interaction for Google Search is in the range of roughly 0.2 to 0.5 (as presented on the slide above), and because queries per session are low, the resulting cost per session is still “less than pennies.” The monetization model is also tightly coupled to this structure in that Google monetizes with ads per query, and the combination of low cost + strong ad yield produces very high margins. In our view, this is why Google Search has been such a durable business model. It is a highly optimized, low-cost service that is monetized efficiently at massive scale. ChatGPT’s cost per interaction is much higher, and the session pattern is different with five to 10 queries per session rather than the short, lightweight search interactions. When you multiply those factors, the cost per session becomes dramatically higher — we think ~100 times higher than Google Search. Importantly, the point is not that ChatGPT is inefficient. The claim is that ChatGPT is already among the leaders in efficiency — and yet the underlying interaction paradigm is still much more compute-intensive per session. We believe this is the core reason Google can’t simply flip Search into a ChatGPT-like model without destabilizing margins. Our research indicates the most economically valuable portion of search is product and commercial search — only ~10% to 20% of queries, but responsible for ~60% to 70% of search revenue. In our view, that concentration is exactly what makes the transition so difficult. Specifically: We believe this is one of the most important ideas in the entire research note. The model moves from low-cost ads and blue links thrown at users toward a higher-value, higher-cost information economy where trust and accurate representation are the product. In our view, this has two direct implications: Google’s current approach — offering a hybrid path where users can go deeper into AI mode — is both clever and useful. In an ideal world, Google would prefer to introduce assistant-style experiences slowly, ring-fence them as a separate business, and price them at a premium. But the point is that reality constrains the strategy because Google has to protect the commercial-search numbers. And though Google would like to layer higher-value services on top and charge advertisers materially more, it may be easier for challengers to enter with higher-cost, higher-trust services without needing to defend a legacy margin structure. This, we believe, is OpenAI’s advantage. That tension makes the hybrid model look less like a stable end state and more like a transitional strategy — a fence-sitter that ultimately has to resolve toward one economic model or the other. In our view, the market is carving into two distinct conflicts: The bottom line is cost per session is the economic forcing function in this new game. It explains why self-disruption is difficult, why the high-value commercial slice is vulnerable and why the market may shift from cheap ad inventory toward higher-cost, trust-based representation. This is the battle line for the next decade. We believe the core issue in “the future of search” is not model quality. The issue is a revenue model mismatch. Traditional search is an ad-funded machine optimized to deliver low-cost discovery — effectively “10 blue links” thrown at the user — where monetization is tied to placement and clicks, not to the intrinsic quality and trustworthiness of the information delivered. As search becomes answer-centric and trust-centric, our research indicates a large portion of Google’s profit pool becomes exposed. In this research we try to make a concentrated revenue point that we believe is the linchpin: In our view, this is the part of the business that is most vulnerable to trust erosion. If users begin to believe the answer is optimized for the advertiser rather than for the buyer, the value proposition degrades quickly — and that small slice is exactly where buyers are most sensitive to quality, ranking integrity and confidence. The risk is that Google can retain the bulk of total search volume and still lose the economically decisive segment: “90% of search,” but not the part that pays the bills. Our research indicates generating an answer with generative AI is at least an order of magnitude more expensive than a classic, highly optimized search query — and potentially two or three orders depending on the experience design. At Google’s scale, even modest mix shifts toward AI-heavy sessions can have outsized margin impact. We believe this becomes both a timing and a strategy issue. In other words, the transition begins to bite into margins as usage patterns migrate, and the company has to manage a delicate balance between to countervailing forces: From the consumer standpoint, there is an upside in that users can increasingly choose between low-cost traditional search and higher-quality, higher-trust answer engines. But that optionality increases competitive pressure. Because Google’s search share is so highly elevated, it has nowhere to go but down from here, because the competitive axis is shifting. In classic search, if the result isn’t good, the user simply refines the query and continues. In assistant-driven search, as users build affinity for an engine that consistently returns higher-quality outcomes, has memory and trust becomes the moat. The platform that earns that trust can pull disproportionate share of the highest-value sessions. The key point is even if Google’s model quality is strong, the business model incentives are different. In our view, the future state is not “smarter ads.” It’s a different value chain where brands need to be represented accurately, compared appropriately, and surfaced based on fit — not on who bought the top slot. The premise of this research captures the delta – a complex, high-intent request can be satisfied in a single minute with ranked options and an action plan, versus a longer, more iterative search process. Our research indicates that this “high-quality commercial search” experience is precisely where share can migrate — and it’s the most economically meaningful slice that moves. We believe OpenAI has a structural incentive advantage rooted in its revenue model: That incentive system is fundamentally different from ad-funded search where the buyer is not the user, and where brands pay for placement. In our opinion, this creates a more direct “quality to revenue” linkage for the assistant platform. On the brand side, our research indicates the emerging play is buyer-facing APIs backed by trusted information, designed to score well in answer engines. That is a different marketing and distribution model than classic search engine optimization and paid links. We believe the right way to frame it is SEO is not dead, but it will matter less over time. As answer engines mediate discovery and ranking through trust and structured vendor information, the importance of classic SEO mechanics declines. Our view is that the market bifurcates in a way that can still look “good” in absolute terms for Google while being strategically disruptive: Google will fight hard for that high-value slice, but our research indicates it requires substantial work above the model layer: APIs, software capabilities, interface design and the surrounding service stack that enables vendors and users to extract real utility from the platform. Bottom line is the future of search is a restructuring of incentives and economics. The platform that aligns trust, representation quality and monetization has the advantage in the most valuable part of the market. We believe it’s useful to end this segment in the context of an earlier Breaking Analysis where we put forth a plausible scenario where Google could have disrupted OpenAI’s first-mover advantage. That scenario was not irrational — it was rooted in Google’s deep technical bench, its distribution and the assumption that it could translate model strength into product and platform leadership. But the picture on the slide above — “OpenAI likely to retain its leadership” — reflects what our research indicates today – the conditions that sustain OpenAI’s lead are strengthening, not weakening. Our view is that the market is over-fixated on model-to-model comparisons. The reality is that the leading labs will all produce very high-quality LLMs. Google’s models are strong. Anthropic’s Claude has positioned around coding. Gemini has demonstrated competence in many tasks and Grok is moving fast. The point is not that any one of these is “bad.” We believe the durable differentiation is shifting away from raw model quality and toward: Our research indicates OpenAI maintains leadership in several areas: We also believe OpenAI’s close relationship with Nvidia matters. Our contention is if Nvidia remains the critical supplier for frontier compute, and if OpenAI is tightly coupled to that ecosystem, then OpenAI is positioned to receive preferential allocation versus competitors — particularly versus those whose narrative depends on Nvidia being displaced. In our view, that allocation dynamic reinforces time-to-capability and time-to-market. The most important datapoint in this segment, in our opinion, is the mix shift described between consumer usage and enterprise adoption. We note movement from roughly 70/30 (users/enterprise) last year to about 60/40 by the end of this year. We believe this is a meaningful signal because enterprise growth tends to be stickier and more platform-defining than consumer novelty. Our research indicates enterprise adoption will increase as organizations learn how to: In our view, that enterprise “data readiness” journey is what turns an AI model into an enterprise system — and that is where platform advantage compounds. We believe Google has advantages and will remain a formidable competitor. But our premise is that OpenAI is more likely to emerge as a high-quality software and platform player in enterprise AI than Google, which — despite being strong technically — is not broadly perceived as the enterprise AI software leader. Our view is that this matters because the next phase of competition is not “who has the best model demo,” but “who owns the workflow and the integration fabric.” Our research indicates OpenAI is “a country mile ahead” at the moment in platform momentum. That does not mean the lead is unassailable. OpenAI could blow up, or competitors could find superior approaches. But as of now, we believe the most likely outcome is continued leadership because the factors that matter most — platform, developer adoption, enterprise mix shift and access to scarce compute — are currently aligned in OpenAI’s favor. The two big conclusions of this Breaking Analysis are: The bottom line is the early “Google disrupts OpenAI” scenario was plausible. But the data and the platform dynamics suggest OpenAI’s first-mover advantage is evolving into something more durable — especially as the enterprise becomes the center of gravity. OpenAI’s relationship with Nvidia is meaningful.

Some trends were predictable, like smart glasses continuing their exponential growth and smartwatches adding more AI and health features. But I didn't anticipate some things, like Oura lawsuits strangling its smart ring rivals or the impact of tariffs. I've decided to look back on my 2025 forecast for smart rings, glasses, and watches, including two analysts' predictions, and judge how well our collective expectations lined up with reality. Then, I'll look at the biggest wearable and fitness watch brands and grade their 2025 performance — where they succeeded and how they could have done better. As expected, Garmin tested "loyal users' willingness to buy pricier status-symbol smartwatches." The Garmin Fenix 8 Pro ($1.2–2K) and Venu X1 ($800) are clear examples, but even mid-rangers like the Venu 4 ($550) have become more high-end. Add in the $800 Apple Watch Ultra 3, $500 and $650 Galaxy Watches, and the $1,000 Polar Grit X2 Pro, and you can see brands normalizing phone-level prices (and offsetting tariff costs). It was also expected that there would be "more options" for thrifty consumers. The Apple Watch SE 3 qualifies, sticking to its old $250 price, but it's the exception. We saw cheap trackers from Xiaomi and CMF, but very few cheap Android smartwatches besides discounted last-gen models. Even Amazfit sold as many $300+ watches as $100 ones. Tariffs have interfered with budget options, making it more profitable to attract wealthier hobbyists. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Meanwhile, Google, Samsung, and Apple started pushing the idea of smartwatch AI in 2025. But it's still mostly on-phone processing of queries and health data analysis. The Pixel Watch 4 and Apple Watch S11 have on-watch AI tools like smart replies or live translation, and I appreciate how Gemini on Android watches syncs well with Google apps. I expect a bigger AI push in 2026, particularly with the Fitbit Personal Health Coach AI. Again, companies clearly want smartwatches to become medical devices, but we're still in the predictive "wellness" phase. For example, Samsung added virtual doctor's visits and prescription management while giving its watches vascular health and antioxidant index analysis, with heart failure warnings coming soon. That said, my analyst's prediction of direct blood pressure monitoring on watches in 2025 didn't happen. But Apple started offering hypertension alerts, while Fitbit and Oura launched hypertension studies — so at least we're getting warning signs for high blood pressure. As for smart rings, I don't have hard figures for 2025 yet, but IDC's current estimates show it's a tiny but growing sliver compared to fitness trackers, and growing much more slowly than smart glasses. Sales have grown, but I'm expecting the category to stagnate. Oura has leveraged its patents to demand royalty payments from every major smart ring brand, bringing Circular and RingConn to heel, successfully banning Ultrahuman from the U.S., and currently challenging Samsung. The current rumor is that Samsung won't make a Galaxy Ring 2, and there's little hope for competition and innovation in the space if brands like Fitbit and Apple decide it's not worth the legal hassle — or giving Oura a cut of the profits — to make a smart ring. Finally, IDC's Jitesh Ubrani wasn't bullish on smart glasses' future last year, saying that "most consumers don't need" the photo/ video/ music/ AI combo and that sales would only climb from 2.5 million to 3.5 million in 2025. Turns out, IDC's current forecast is 9.4 million glasses sold in 2025, Meta's Ray-Ban/Oakley partner EssilorLuxottica has ramped up production to 10 million per year, and Ubrani is much more enthusiastic about smart glasses' future. That said, 10 million sold may not qualify as "mainstream," compared to 200 million smartwatches and trackers in 2025. The Samsung AI and HUD glasses coming in 2026 should help the category continue to grow, especially internationally. Garmin launched a series of successful, high-quality watches this year: the Instinct 3 for hikers and campers, the Vivoactive 6 for thrifty indoor athletes and daily step-counters, the Forerunner 570 for runners and triathletes, the Forerunner 970 for pro-level athletes and trail runners, and the Venu 4 as the all-around best option. Unfortunately, Garmin raised watch prices across its entire lineup for extra revenue, delivering strong earnings but making them less accessible to everyday athletes. As much as I love the Venu X1, I can't recommend people spend $800 on one. From an economic standpoint, Garmin has become a top-5 brand for worldwide smartwatch sales. Despite that, Garmin's stock plummeted because its uber-expensive Fenix 8 Pro couldn't compete with last year's massive Fenix 8 sales, undoing all its gains. The new Garmin Connect+ subscription, which launched this year, may have earned some profits, but Garmin fans have never embraced the feature, especially when it's required for features like Garmin Trails, extra badges, and their Year in Review summary. Unrealistic shareholder expectations aside, Garmin has had a strong year, but its tendency to price-lock the best features to Fenix-level watches is harder to stomach when the "cheaper" models are still expensive. And you never know when there'll be a major blue triangle crash. I won't grade every fitness watch brand, but I'm highlighting COROS because it's had a strong 2025 as a foil to Garmin. The COROS Nomad, Apex 4, and Pace 4 have each impressed me with their accurate GPS and HR data, weeks of battery life, affordable prices, and fast performance for trail and street maps. COROS gained some ground on its rivals with vital features: media playback controls, move alerts, undo laps, flashlight mode, cycle tracking, mid-activity voice alerts, street names and POIs on maps, and an adventure journal. Equally important, COROS updates its entire lineup, rather than price-lock features to the flagships. It makes models like the $300 COROS Pace Pro feel like a great value, because you get tools like offline maps and Strava Live Segments that only $600+ Garmin watches have. It's no coincidence that COROS is the "fastest-growing watch brand year-over-year on Strava" in the app's 2025 end-of-year report. It won't catch up to Garmin (2nd overall) anytime soon, but COROS has earned a reputation for budget quality with serious athletes — stealing Garmin's customers. COROS's main 2025 blemish was an IT exposé revealing major security vulnerabilities on all COROS watches, letting hackers potentially access your account, snoop on notifications, and worse. COROS says it has resolved these issues, thankfully. Oura reports selling 5.5 million rings so far, with half those sales in the past 12 months. It also has a new U.S. DoD contract, which requires them to build a manufacturing facility in Texas. This deal also caused some backlash over fears Oura would share private data with the Trump administration, but CEO Tom Hale has reassured otherwise. The Oura Ring 4 continuously received new features in 2025. The LLM-powered Oura Advisor is the centerpiece, giving advice and coaching based on your ring stats. The AI Meals tool gives you a nutritional summary of your plate with a photo. Your Oura Ring can now track pregnancy and premenopause symptoms. Its Preventive Health data studies signs of cumulative stress. The list goes on! Oura also launched the Ring 4 Ceramic, a more expensive model with premium zirconia ceramic materials. While our tester praised how "incredibly soft" it feels to wear, he's also noticed areas where the finish has been "scratched off" from wear and tear, and that the new finish makes it "noticeably thicker and a bit heavier" than the normal Ring 4. Overall, Oura kept users happy with new features, made record-breaking profits, and weaponized patents to scuttle its biggest rival (Ultrahuman) and demand royalties from the rest. That's a good business position to be in. Meta released three pairs of smart glasses in 2025, which is a significant accomplishment. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) is the centerpiece, and while it isn't significantly different from the original, the extra hours of battery and 3K video do make it easier to recommend. The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses cater specifically to the athletic crowd, particularly with the Garmin integration, and while I loved them, it'll take time to see whether they resonate because of the weight and price. The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses have struck a chord with the tech niche, with some impressive HUD features that have started to live up to the Google Glass idea people have waited a decade for. They're too thick, heavy, and expensive to break out of that niche, but it's a step in the right direction. Hardware aside, Meta has done well with software updates in 2025. It added Meta AI support for several apps (Audible, Spotify, Google Calendar, Outlook, and Weather), released Live AI and Live Translation, sped up camera captures, and brought Gen 2 features like improved stabilization to the Gen 1 glasses.

Posted on December 21, 2025 by Deanna McLean Leave a Comment When it comes to ecommerce, standing out means ditching cookie-cutter templates for product pages that not only captivate but also convert. With Divi 5‘s Woo Product Modules, you can build high-impact product pages entirely from scratch, all while seamlessly integrating real-time WooCommerce data. In this post, we’ll walk you through creating a product page from scratch using Divi 5’s 17 Woo Product Modules and the Theme Builder. Let’s get started. Divi 5’s Woo Product Modules represent a step forward in ecommerce design, offering 17 native modules that pull dynamic data directly from WooCommerce. You’ll have full control over every element, from eye-catching visuals to seamless user interactions via Divi’s intuitive Visual Builder. To make sense of this toolkit, we’ve grouped the 17 modules into four intuitive categories based on their roles in a typical product page flow. Each integrates effortlessly with Woo’s backend, ensuring your content stays fresh and functional. Let’s break them down: Start strong by guiding users and keeping them informed with these foundational elements that handle orientation and real-time feedback. At the heart of any compelling product page, these modules showcase the essentials: visuals, details, and specs that hook visitors and build trust. With these modules, you can turn passive browsers into active buyers. Wrap up with smart upselling and broader explorations, using these to extend sessions and inflate order values. With these modules, you’re not just building pages but creating experiences that convert. In the next section, we’ll roll up our sleeves and step through building a custom product page, from layout to launch. If you’d like to follow along with a completed design, fill out the form below to download the files.

Follow along and you will be a Divi master in no time. If you are already subscribed simply type in your email address below and click download to access the layout pack. This section will guide you through creating a modern product page using Divi 5’s Woo Product Modules. By the end, you’ll have a fully functional product page that beautifully showcases each product on your site. Here’s a quick preview: You’ll want to ensure that WooCommerce is installed and activated and that you have created at least one product. Next, navigate to Divi > Theme Builder and click the + Add New Template button. Once the modal appears, click Build New Template. In the Template Settings modal, scroll down to and check All Products. Click Create Template to continue. Next, click Add Custom Body. When the Theme Builder loads, select Build From Scratch from the available options. Add a single column row to the page. When the Insert Module Or Row modal appears, locate the Woo Modules option and select it. Locate the Woo Breadcrumbs module and add it to the row. By default, This Product will be selected in the Product dropdown menu in the Content tab. This option will allow Divi 5 to easily pull content for each product in every category. For this tutorial, we will select a product to display to make it easier to see how the layout will look with an actual product in view. As you add modules to the design, ensure that This Product is always selected. Click over to the Design tab and expand the Text dropdown menu. Ensure the Paragraph tab is selected and choose Poppins as the Text Font, #5a4130 as the Text Color, and 14px as the Text Text Size. Next, select the Links tab in the Text menu. Select Poppins as the Link Font, Underline as the Link Font Style, and #83A65B as the Link Text Color. Next, add a two-column row directly underneath the first row in the layout. In the left column, add the Woo Product Images module to the column. Swap to the Design tab. Expand the Image menu followed by the Border menu. Set the Image Border Radius to 20px on all sides. Scroll down to reveal the Sale Badge menu. Expand it and add #C77347 as the Sale Badge Color. In the Text menu, select Poppins as the Sale Badge Font, Uppercase for the Sale Badge Font Style, #ffffff as the Sale Badge Text Color, and 15px as the Sale Badge Text Size. Add the Woo Product Title module in the second column. Select the Design tab and expand the Title Text menu. Set the Title Heading Level to H1, Poppins as the Title Font, and #5A4130 as the Title Text Color. Set the Title Text Size to 4em. If you want to make the layout responsive as you go along, you can click the Edit Responsive Values button to make immediate changes to any module, saving time as you design the page. When the Responsive Editor modal appears, you can adjust the values in real-time. Enter 2.75em for tablet and phone views. Next, add the Woo Product Rating module underneath the Title in the second column. In the Design tab, expand the Star Rating menu. Set the Star Rating Text Alignment to Left, #5A4130 as the Star Rating Text Color, 15px as the Star Rating Text Size, and 1px as the Star Rating Letter Spacing. Next, expand the Text menu. Enter Poppins as the Text Font, #5A4130 as the Text Text Color, and 13px as the Text Text Size. Next, add the Woo Product Description Module to the second column. In the Content tab, decide whether to use the Description or Short Description in the Description Type field. Switch to the Design tab. Expand the Text dropdown menu and select Poppins as the Text Font, #5A4130 as the Text Text Color, and 1.8em as the Text Line Height. Next, we’ll add the Woo Product Price module to the second column. Expand the Price Text menu. Select Poppins as the Price Font and #5A4130 as the Price Text Color. Add the Woo Product Add To Cart module. In the Design tab, expand the Field Labels menu and enter Poppins as the Field Labels Font. In the Field Labels Text Color field, use #5A4130. Next, expand the Fields menu. Enter #5A4130 in the Fields Background Color and Fields Focus Background Color fields. Set the Opacity to 0. In the Fields Focus Text Color field, enter #5A4130. Expand the Fields Text menu. Enter Poppins as the Field Font, #5A4130 as the Fields Text Color, and 16px as the Fields Text Size. Next, expand the Field Border menu. In the Fields Border Radius settings, enter 5px. Add 1px Field Border Width and set the Fields Border Color to #5A4130. In the Dropdown Menu settings, set the Dropdown Menus Background Color and Fields Focus Background Color to #5A4130 with an Opacity of 0. Set the Dropdown Menus Focus Text Color to #5A4130. Next, expand the Field Spacing settings. Set the Dropdown Menu Margin to 5px on all sides. In the Module Text dropdown menu, enter Poppins as the Dropdown Menu Font, #5A4130 as the Dropdown Menu Text Color, and 13px as the Dropdown Menu Text Size. Next, expand the Field Border menu. Add 1px Dropdown Menus Border Width and set the Dropdown Menus Border Color to #5A4130. The last step in this module is to style the Button. Expand the Button menu and toggle Use Custom Styles For Button on. Expand the Button Background settings and assign #83A65B as the Button Background Color. In the Button Border menu, add 50px Button Border Radius. In the Button Text menu, use Poppins as the Button Font, Uppercase in the Button Font Style, and 15px for the Button Text Size. Finally, in the Button Spacing menu, add 15px Button Padding to the top and bottom and 35px for the left and right. The last module to add to the second column of the row is the Woo Product Meta module. In the Design tab, expand the Text menu. For the Paragraph tab, enter Poppins as the Meta Font, Left in the Meta Text Alignment field, and #5A4130 in the Meta Text Color field. Tab over to Links. Select Poppins as the Link Font and enter #83A65B as the Link Text Color. Add a new single-column row under the two-column row that houses our product info. Select the Woo Product Tabs module. Expand the Body Text menu. Enter Poppins for the Font and set the Text Color to #5A4130. Next, expand the Tab Text menu. Enter #83A65B as the Active Tab Text Color and #5A4130 as the Tab Text Color. Set the Tab Font to Poppins. Add a new single-column row. Select and add the Woo Related Products module to the page. Expand the Overlay menu. Add #C77347 to the Overlay Icon Color field. Open the Image menu. In the Border settings, add 20px Image Border Radius to all sides. Select and expand the Star Rating menu. Set the Star Rating Text Alignment to Left. Use #C77347 for the Star Rating Text Color field. Open the Sale Badge menu. Enter #C77347 as the Sale Badge Color. Expand the Text menu. Select Poppins as the Sale Badge Font, set the Sale Badge Font Style to Uppercase, the Sale Badge Text Color to #ffffff, the Sale Badge Text Size to 15px, and the Sale Badge Letter Spacing to 1px. Next, open the Title Text menu. Use Poppins as the Title Font, #5A4130 as the Title Text Color, and 4em for the Title Text Size. Use Divi 5’s Responsive Editor to set the tablet and phone views to 2.75em. Open the Product Title Text menu. Enter Poppins for the Product Title Font and set the Product Title Text Alignment to Left. Use #5A4130 as the Product Title Text Color and set the Product Title Text Size to 16px. Use 1.2em as the Product Title Line Height. For the Price Text menu, enter Poppins as the Price Font and use #5A4130 as the Price Text Color. Finally, open the Sale Price Text menu. Use Poppins as the Sale Price Font. In the Sale Price Text Color field, enter #5A4130. Before saving your product page, use Divi 5’s Customizable Responsive Breakpoints to navigate through each screen size. This ensures that your layout looks seamless on every device.

Title: The Magnificent Seven Myth Is Starting to Crack
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/21/the-magnificent-seven-myth-is-starting-to-crack/
Time Published: 2025-12-21T15:23:52Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St There is a widespread perception that the Magnificent Seven represent the greatest investment basket in history. Put equal money into all seven, hold forever, and you cannot lose. Lee and I both agreed that this narrative is starting to break down. Lee cited recent work from BTIG that caught his attention. As of mid-December, only Nvidia and Alphabet are beating the S&P 500 this year. The rest of the Magnificent Seven are trailing the benchmark. That surprised even seasoned investors. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) underperforming was not shocking, but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) lagging the index caught many people off guard given its solid earnings and strong AI narrative. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have also struggled on a relative basis. Collectively, that means five of the seven stocks that carried the market for nearly three years are no longer doing the heavy lifting. Lee and I have both seen this movie before. Every era has its dominant group, whether it was the Nifty Fifty in the 1960s, the dot-com leaders in 2000, or the financials and housing-related stocks before the global financial crisis. Leadership does not disappear forever, but it does rotate. What makes the current setup notable is how quickly that rotation is happening. I said plainly that when leading stocks start to run out of gas, that is often how market tops are formed. You do not need the entire market to collapse. You just need fewer stocks pulling it higher. When five of the seven biggest drivers stall, the margin for error shrinks fast. Lee pointed out that the S&P 500 itself has still had a very good year, up roughly 15% to 17%, and is on track for a third consecutive year of double-digit gains. That is rare. This has been one of the longest bull runs we have seen since the mid-1990s, rivaling the recovery periods after the dot-com bust and the financial crisis. That strength is exactly why complacency becomes dangerous. Long bull markets convince investors that the ride will never end. History says otherwise. Lee closed the thought perfectly, echoing one of the oldest adages on Wall Street. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Casinos are not built because the house loses. The long-term trend of the S&P 500 may be upward, but it is not a straight line. Knowing when leadership is narrowing can be the difference between protecting gains and giving them back. [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there is a conception that the Magnificent seven are the, that is the best investment in the history of the world. [00:00:11] Just take those, put your money into them. you’ll be good forever. Put an equal amount of money into each one you cannot lose. Guess what? How are they doing compared to the S&P 500 this year? [00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Well, strangely enough, and, this caught my attention about three or four days ago, maybe a week, and it was an article from the good folks at BTIG, which is an outstanding firm on Wall Street that pointed out that only Nvidia and Google were beating the S&P 500 this year, the rest of the Magnificent seven, and you know who they are. [00:00:53] Trailing the basic index for large cap stocks, which I was stunned by that, because I knew, that Amazon had underperformed, so I thought, well, that, that doesn’t surprise me, but I thought Microsoft would be ahead of it. ’cause they’ve had a solid year. No, just those two. [00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: well, yeah, meta, listen, some of those stocks have really done very poorly. [00:01:19] Lee Jackson: on a comparative basis. Yeah, so I mean, literally they led the market for almost three years. So it’s no surprise that they’re having a hard time at this juncture because most of ’em, for the most part, are overbought and they tend to correct extremely quickly. And only Nvidia and Google have had the huge stories behind them and, so much positive earningS&Positive forward expectations, right. That, yeah. So it, it’s interesting though, how a group, but it, listen, we’ve been around long enough to see, and I wasn’t really in the business in the sixties for the Nifty 50, but there’s always been a group of stocks, like we discussed recently, there’s only like two stocks that were the top stocks in 2000 in the S&P 500 that still are. [00:02:08] So it just shows you, how things rotate. And one of those was Microsoft, but it shows you how things rotate and it’s only at like once in a generation. It’s not like once every a hundred years. [00:02:19] Doug McIntyre: Well, I think if you want to call ato, if you say, when do you call a peak in a stock market. Okay. When do you think a stock market actually has hit a spot and the only direction is down? [00:02:33] Take the stocks that are the leading stocks and when they start to run out of gas, and you’ve just described, you’ve got five of seven running outta gas, you’re really thinning out the stocks that have pulled the market higher. Absolutely. But when I start to see those guys get weak, I start to call a top. [00:02:54] That’s when I start to see a top in the stock market. Yeah. [00:02:57] Lee Jackson: and the S&P and the thing that’s, that, that’s interesting about that is now it’s not like the S&P hasn’t had a decent year. It’s up 15, 16, 17% in the ballpark. And we’re headed for the third full year of double digit. S&P 500, growth going up, over double digits for three years in a row. [00:03:19] And this has been one of the longest bull markets we’ve had since I, I don’t know. I, guess you’d have to go back to the early aughts, when we rallied out of the, out of the dot com explosion or maybe the period after the real estate stuff from maybe 2010 to 15. But I haven’t seen anything like this since the mid nineties. [00:03:40] Doug McIntyre: Well, let’s go back to something we said earlier, and it’s important if you own the S&P 500, if you’ve got a financial in, in instrument where you own it, we’re talking about taking half of your profits off the table, right? That isn’t just true of stocks, okay? Yeah. If you own S&P 500, if you own gold, whatever it is, don’t just stay there and assume that, well, this is gonna go up forever. [00:04:06] It’s great. If you’ve made a lot of money on, being, there’s several ways to be in the S&P 500. I would, I’d sell some of that absolutely. [00:04:18] Lee Jackson: After this year, after the run we’ve had these last three years. That’s what I mean. That’s always been, trust me, when I was a salesman, that was the, I, could easily get people to buy, but it was hard to get them to sell for just that reason. [00:04:32] They thought, oh, it’s gonna go higher. And I said, well, look, that’s why I always had, look, let’s sell half. Let’s sell a third. Let’s at least put some in the bank. Because they don’t build those casinos ’cause the house loses and eventually this will come back down. The long term for the S&P 500 is a sweet 45 degree angle, but it has some big dips in it. [00:04:52] And sometimes those dips take quite a while to come back. I mean, after 2000, after that blowup, it took years for the NASDAQ to come back. Oh my God. Like 10 years it took years. And after other sell offs, it’s taken years so it never hurts to take some money. And then you can reinvest that into something maybe a little safer or a stock that hasn’t run as much, or whatever the case might be. [00:05:16] But I think you’re exactly right.

Pietro Laureano describes it beautifully in The Water Atlas. It’s one of the finest books I’ve ever seen. Here’s a pdf (big): https://catalogue.unccd.int/1148_The-water-atlas.pdf Thank you! “Finnish finance minister calls EU’s loan deal for Ukraine ‘major failure'” Gee, she is pretty sour about the EU only giving Zelensky €90 billion instead of those frozen/stolen Russian assets. I got an idea. Maybe Finnish Finance Minister Riikka Purra could tell the EU that Finland will step up to the plate and give Zelensky €120 billion from their coffers to make up the €210 billion that he was expecting. Hope that President Alexander Stubb is not reading this as he would regard that as a great idea. I feel like there are some matters of the conflict with respect to engineering or logistics I can speak to and understand. But the continued push to throw more and more money into the corrupt pit that is Ukraine baffles me. I can’t even ask NC’s favorite question, “cui bono?” I have no idea who could possibly benefit from this death and destruction. Especially since we have now proven our NATO weapons platforms don’t work and showing more people how badly they don’t work as the conflict continues can’t be good for business. Also, it appears from polling results that EUcrats aligned with the Ukraine project continue to do poorly and are now facing a resurgent right wing in their countries. So why is everyone in Europe so damn committed to death by 10000 cuts here? There is no plan for winning in the sense that the West have defined victory. Russia has been very clear that they’re not going to freeze the conflict or grant a ceasefire so Ukraine can lick its wounds and rre-arm. So what are Finland, Germany, France, the UK, etc. doing here? Are there any analysts who seem to have a clue? Thomas Fazi, on his Substack, makes an interesting argument: “ I intend to argue that the current NATO-Russia confrontation is simply the latest chapter in a century-long Western campaign to weaken, isolate and contain Russia. This antagonism long predates the Soviet Union and is rooted in both geopolitical and civilisational motives: Western powers have historically viewed Russia as too large, too independent and too culturally distinct to integrate into a Western-led order” https://www.thomasfazi.com/p/the-wests-century-long-war-against (Sorry if this has already been a link) With politicians who have the memory of a fish, explanations like this leave me uncomfortable. IMO this doesn’t make any sense and doesn’t help in any way or form to explain why the idiots in charge are playing the fool so much. We might try to find reasons back to the Middle Ages but let’s be clear, these are not “reasons” neither “roots” of conflict. Politicians have the minds of goldfish. The Rich like it that way. Ancient cultural imperatives and Prime Directives remove the need for “having a mind” and any goldfish can keep re-doing more of the same of what has been pre-done for the last thousand years. And with the “brain-parasites” from Eastern Europe and ” Legacy Great-Game Britain” now in firm command of NATO’s cultural brain-command centers, don’t be surprised if this is sustained until it can’t be, per Herbert Stein’s dictum that “anything that can’t continue will stop”. This will continue until it can’t, then it will stop. >>>So what are Finland, Germany, France, the UK, etc. doing here? Have you ever seen deer trapped in a car’s headlights? I think that see the oncoming wreck, but have no idea what to do except more of the same. I wonder if the continuing the war serves the cause of consolidating the EU into a kind of US of Europe. Indebting the member nations by funding Ukraine and having member states indebt themselves by expanding their militaries will increasingly put the EU under the tutelege of creditors. Creditors might prefer dealing with one central agency in Brussels rather than dozens of national capitals. Immigration/Police state Please see: https://jennbudd.substack.com/p/the-real-purpose-of-ice-raids This may be the reason that all of the border relief workers that I work with speak of seeing less BP and way more active military along the wall. People doing water drops are now regularly approached by bored military personnel wondering what’s going on. I have heard that BP agents who “go on safari” get significant bonus and Per Diem money. And since it is really boring patrolling out here, going off to tackle some guys in a Home Depot parking lot may look like fun While President Trump and the people he works with probably believe that they can suppress voters using the same methods as the Southern elites did after they overthrew Reconstruction, using goon squads (and let’s be serious here, death squads as both the police and the KKK were by the elites and not only in the South) would likely go very badly for them. If nothing else, I am not sure that the local police and the national guard would acquiesce, nor would the locals themselves. The Border Patrol would probably win in the first election, but once people got over their suprise, and after the ruling party lost its Mandate of Heaven, the loss of acceptance, and therefore authority and power would be extreme. The United States is still a quasi democracy and the government depends on the people’s acceptance of at least semi fair elections; it has been this way since almost two centuries before there was an United States. It is more of a cultural reflex or instinct than conscious thought. Historically authoritarianism has been expensive. Policing, containment and punishment compete for resources while simultaneously reducing manpower. Brutality, torture, terror and horror are then made political tools, pour encourager les autres. With this, and the redirection to MAGA aims of the vast American siloviki between Georgetown and Langley, team Trump hope to keep those domestic costs manageable. That said, the incompetence of it all in the face of our traditional myths of freedom, culture of satirical humor, and the basic decency amongst most of us commoners makes me believe you’re right and eventually we’ll vote again for something better! Correction. “Hope we will be offered the chance to vote for something better…..” Preventing that has been the plan so far…… Which has worked so far, but denying even the option of voting for the approved candidates is still likely to backfire. I don’t know. Denying the people the option of voting for “the other side” did sort of backfire on the Dems, but it didn’t exactly lead to any improvement, other than tearing down further what was already a dubious situation. That post is likely correct that the idea is to use ICE and border patrol to suppress black and latino votes. Given how its going and the stakes involved, I would guess in particular in the 2026 midterms. There are a number of other clues to such an agenda: Trump’s expressed wish to federalise the elections, Trump’s propaganda against postal voting, ICE and border patrol pushing the line by raids in court houses, Trump’s continued insistence that 2020 was stolen, the open gerrymandering. I think what might stop them is the polling. If it looks like they will still lose they might think twice. Or double down, depending on how desperate they are at that point. “India will surpass Germany to become third-largest economy by 2027: Scindia” I don’t mean to rain on India’s parade but it should be remembered that German is being rapidly deindustrialized as well as taking on colossal amounts of debt so it may not be so much a case of India rising here as Germany sinking. Here are the guys at The Duran talking about Merz and the German economy- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWCUgu_hzM4 (20:41 mins) I think part of the German decline is because they are paying dearly to India as a middle-man for Russian energy. The final phase of the decolonization of Europe – the idea being that a colonial system consist of the colonized and the colonizers, not really dipping into the idea that EU has been a colony of/exploited by US (that’s another discussion). Germany’s pains are largely self-inflicted. Their abrupt energy policy change some years ago resulted in loss of base load generating capacity. Most utility planners would call that stupid, inviting outages and soaring prices as alternatives were desperately sought. There are more orderly ways to transition over decent realistic intervals that don’t require such risks. Add in their so-called political class and that spelled trouble. Is acquiescing to Biden’s elimination of Nordstream the policy shift to which you refer? They had some problems before no doubt due to the same Greens who led them into war with Ukraine(once removed) shuttering base load, but industry didn’t actively start migrating until the Biden move forced it. Did the Germans blow Nordstream? The decision not to invest in new nuclear power (or renovation to practically the same extent as new), but instead go for wind and solar did not cause outages and soaring prices. We know this because there was enough time between that shift and the 2022 war to see the difference. In fact the minimal cost of marginal electricity production from wind and solar pushed prices down. What increased electricity prices in 2022 was the lack of cheap gas and half the French reactors being idle for half a year. (So much for stable base load). And the main problem for German industry isn’t even electricity prices, it’s gas as a direct input in industrial processes. >>>>Americans have lied about a Venmo glitch to avoid paying the bill. Not saying that is neccessarily wrong….but all these “polling” stories, irrespective of “conclusion”, need to be taken with an **extreme** grain of salt unless conducted by a reputable pollster. There is a cottage industy of lazy market research and polling—-relying on paid, online respondents. (garbage in, garbage out) naturally since it’s paid, the respondent pool skews to self-identifying as wealthy—as few paid polls involving research the non-comfortable. see amy survey, especially touted by a non-authoritative or tabloid outlet (NY Post)….be skeptical! My bank doesn’t allow Venmo transfers, for what it’s not worth. The article says it’s this one from Harris https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Income-Paradox-Survey-November-2025.pdf. It doesn’t mention paying respondents. I thought it was an interesting read but otoh not really a surprise. I don’t think it would be hard to use up a 6-figure income on mortgage, kids, day care, cars, insurance, utilities, food and the rest. Also see Part 1: My Life Is a Lie by Michael Green, and IIRC has been previously linked at NC, in which he argues that the true poverty line for a family of four should be $140K per year for a family of four. Tangentially related, I was just listening to a New Yorker Radio Hour interview with Maine Senate candidate, Graham Platner, in which he claims he and his wife are getting by on $60K per year, which he says is only made possible by his having free healthcare from the VA. I haven’t listened to the interview. Maybe he’s giving a lot of his annual salary to his campaign, but U.S. Senators are paid $174,000 a year. “James Webb Space Telescope confirms 1st ‘runaway’ supermassive black hole rocketing through home galaxy at 2.2 million mph: ‘It boggles the mind!” Imagine a planet with an emerging sapient species. They go from discovering agricultural to being an industrial society in only 4,000 year. Eventually they put more and more resources into astronomy because one part of the sky looks weird. And eventually they work out that it is because a supermassive black hole is heading directly for them and there is not a damn thing to be done. What sort of effect would that have on an intelligent species? And for all we know, this could be happening right now. there was a story arc in Stargate Universe about just that…nd im too scatterbrained, atm…but i do recall a couple of Star Trek episodes and at least one Arthur C Clarke story regarding this scenario. lol, prob. thinking of the Star Trek Voy episode where the Voyager is an anomaly in a time-accelerated planet….and Voyager causes a scientific explosion on said planet. (The Doctor also fathers a kid, random unexplored plot point) That episode is based on a short story….and in classic literary style, there is a debate of the Voyager story is an homage, or an outright rip-of And that is all I can remember without resorting to the internet. and IIRC, this type of plot point is almost commo enough to be labeled a sci-fi trope? Know the episode that you mean as it was one of their finest in story telling. It was called “Blink of an Eye”- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_of_an_Eye_(Star_Trek:_Voyager) I liked how in each era they were at the same place that starts off a hill with a shrine to the gods until it is eventually overlooking an advanced city. You guys might enjoy the following Netflix video which is kinda along the same lines- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQGEUv6CCPM (3:46 mins) It really does boggle the mind. I got stuck with acute boggling twice just in the first sentence. First, this black hole is “10 million times larger than the sun”. I guess that means they estimate the diameter of its event horizon at about 10^7 x the diameter of the sun. That’s about 10^5 astronomucal units (AU), i.e. 100,000 times the distance of the Earth from the sun. For comparison, the orbit of Neptune is about 60 AU. This black hole is about the size of the Oort cloud is theorized to be. Second, “rocketing through space at a staggering 2.2 million miles per hour”. What does that mean? In first year physics at Edinburgh we got an introduction to Special Relativity class and since then I have never been comfortable with the notion of astronomical speed or velocity. I can deal with quantifying the relative movent of two things but I don’t understand the speed of one thing in space. Is space itself a thing we can measure the speed of something else against? And that speed they said, 1000 km/s. For comparison, the speed of light is only 300 times that. But yeah, whatever that means, if you think human violence is bad, or even measured against what some imagine god might do to punish us, the scale and power of this speedy SMBH boggles. “First, this black hole is “10 million times larger than the sun”. I guess that means they estimate the diameter of its event horizon at about 10^7 x the diameter of the sun.” OTOH, they could mean that the *mass* of that black hole is 10 million times the mass of our sun. Which I think is more likely, but I haven’t read the article. I considered that but then I think they should have used a word other than “larger”. However, assuming you’re right, the Schwarzschild radius for 10 million solar masses, according to Wolfram Alpha, is 295.3 10^8, only 42 times larger than the sun, or about 0.1974 AU, which fits inside the orbit of Mercury. *only* “its event horizon at about 10^7 x the diameter of the sun” The mass of this black hole is about 10 million times the sun not 10 million times larger. https://astronomyexplained.com/how-big-are-black-holes/#google_vignette “The supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy Messier 87 (M87) gained significant attention in 2019. In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope took the first image of its shadow. With a mass estimated to be 6.5 billion times that of the Sun, this supermassive black hole has a size comparable to the solar system.” So comparing physical size of the sun to a black hole has to take in the difference in density. Think of a lead ball compared to a styrofoam ball. Well, now I’m boggling again. 6.5 billion solar masses gives M87’s SMBH a 128.3 AU event horizon radius. I’m no physicist but am puzzled by the assertion in the story that this thing is generating a shock-wave ahead of itself, given that a) its supergravity would surely attract anything towards it as soon as any influence is felt and, b) it’s travelling in a vacuum so what would transmit any shockwave forward? Somewhere in the Universe it probably is. Aren’t we in that same thought experiment with our own heat death? Cassandras and skeptics. Venezuela tanker: “But the vessel boarded on Saturday, called the Centuries, is not on a list of entities under U.S. sanctions that is publicly maintained by the Treasury Department. The people inside Venezuela’s oil industry said the cargo belongs to an established China-based oil trader with a history of taking Venezuelan crude oil to Chinese refineries.” https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/20/us/politics/us-coast-guard-venezuela-oil-tanker.html Pirating Chinese oil seems like something that could have some sort of international fallout but who knows anymore. There never seem to be any consequences for US actions internationally. You should read the Homeland Security tweet- ‘Homeland Security @DHSgov PREPARE TO BE BOARDED. This morning @USCG in coordination with the @DeptofWar executed a lightning strike operation to seize the Motor Tanker Centuries, which is suspected of carrying oil subject to U.S. sanctions. The iron fist of America’s joint military and federal law enforcement rules the waves.’ https://xcancel.com/DHSgov/status/2002493812976095249 Arrgghhhh, me maties. Good thing that they did not drag China into all this as they won’t sit down and take it. Oh wait… It’s all so very Ragnar Danneskjöld, this piracy on the high seize… Does everything have to follow the plot in Atlas Shrugged? Reads like some teen bragging about his videogame wins. Surprised they didn’t spell it “Rulz the waves”. Also, I’m no history expert but wasn’t “iron fist” what Stalinist Russia was labelled? Wow our military is bragging about taking over a non-military vessel You guys look like idiots Actually the Coast Guard, which I have a hard time equating with “the military,” although I guess they really are. I don’t recall ever seeing a report that they brutalized the crews of the vessels they seize. Say China (or Russia), sinks a third of the u.s. navy in one fell swoop. I’m wondering if Americans would “rally around the flag” or condemn the current administration for negligence. In that event, to hide our shame and embarrassment at having been defeated by the commie Chinese horde of lesser humans, we’d resort to our own “Samson option”. Because if no one is around to write about a defeat, then it didn’t happen. That’s really dark. Dark but accurate. This is why even after all this the opponents to empire continue to hang separately. Samsonite Option or American Tourister Option? I’d expect Russia and China to arrange a “freedom of navigation” exercise in Caribbean Sea in the very near future. And I doubt it will escalate beyond that. Maybe a joint Russia-China task force sailing between Cuba and Florida then? Can you imagine the panic? We lost our minds over a balloon. https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3288543/f-22-safely-shoots-down-chinese-spy-balloon-off-south-carolina-coast/ Heh heh, yes we did. Very interesting hypothetical that gives you an idea of how much fun it is to be Putin or Xi these days. It has seemed to me that Putin and Lavrov have been trying to conduct an intervention for power and violence addicts since Munich ’07, but now it’s more like cornering a rabid dog. That answers Joe Biden’s question from SOTU that year… “The iron fist of America’s joint military and federal law enforcement rules the waves.” The messages continue to shock and scare me despite preceding insanity. I won’t make the obvious points, ie. 1. What Federal Law was this tanker in breach of? 2. Federal Jurisdiction is limited to territorial waters only. After all, the US has joyfully regressed to its Wild West childhood where the man with the biggest gun wins, as long as it’s John Wayne. There never seem to be any consequences for US actions internationally. Well, not necessarily immediate consequences, but if we entertain the Mahanian idea of the USA being a Sea Power (as in dependent of secure sea lines), deteriorating the the trade security in the proximity of the North American continent may have certain long term repercussions. If naval conflicts replace the “Pax Americana” in places the Multipolar Stability (between agreement capable nations) can’t reach, US may learn about autarky at an accelerated pace. There never seem to be any immediate consequences for US actions internationally. Fixed it for ya! I would say BRICS and the rise of a multipolar world is a consequence of America’s actions. A world responding to decades of senseless wars. The more immediate problem is the neocons are very likely to get the war they so desperately desire despite the fact that the neocon wars America has conducted over the last couple of decades have done a huge number on the US military. Sometimes I cannot help but feel that the whole neocon bit for the last forty years has been a plot to wreck America, mostly because it seems to have worked.

Frankly wasting the ink to produce 113 pages of big black blocks is the Trump regime mocking people. At least the entire Epstein saga is finished and closed and nobody will ever talk of it again, especially during the midterms. Please Rev Kev, Think of the revenue stream with all those black Sharpies utilized! Disagree on the Epstein saga being over. Trump is still falling, and as the fall picks up speed the Epstein matter will come back. It’s too radioactive to die anytime soon. For either party. Based on knowns, the fallout will be felt far more among the Dems. Bubba is front and center, and doesn’t have the benefit of Epstein’s own attorney and many witnesses attesting to lack of scandalous involvement for Trump. Bubba likely will be joined by a lot of celebrities in the hot seat. Also count on many from both sides of the aisle and from academia and media. The full scope of the espionage and blackmail may never be known, but more spotlights on DC, Cambridge and elsewhere are welcome. Now, pray for the children victimized as their experiences will haunt them for the rest of their lives. Bubba is front and center because Trump was redacted and he wasn’t that of a big deal, politically and power wise speaking… Me thinks Rev Kev was being sarcastic ;-) Could be wrong, though. Perhaps AI can “fill in” the redacted text? Might make for some interesting denials from team Trump. Re the Iran/water story–talk about burying the lead. This is the final para. Politically, the country’s ambition for food security through self-reliance needs to be rethought, hydrologists say. There is simply not enough water to achieve it in the long run. Madani and others call for farmers to switch from growing thirsty staple crops such as rice to higher-value, less water-intensive crops that can be sold internationally in exchange for staples. But that requires Iran to lose its current political status as an international pariah and rejoin the global trading community. Given the heavy Israeli thumb on all of Iran’s international relations clearly the implied path for sanctions removal would be to bring back the reign of the Shahs who, as the article admits, also had more than a little to do with aquifer pumping and other environmental mistakes. One might also point out that the Cadillac Desert problem is prominent in our own Southwest with politically powerful agricultural incumbents being a factor. …rejoin the global trading community. Does the writer know that Iran joined BRICS+ two years ago? It’s 36% of the global community by GDP PPP and 46% by population. 3 of the world top food producing countries are members, too. So maybe, just maybe, Iran is a enough of a member of the global trading community? All in all, I think it was a decent article, especially on the technical points. Like almost everything on Iran in Western or Gulf Arab media though, there’s a strand of concern-trolling running through the whole thing that omits a lot. Besides the sanctions issue you mention: 1. The author brings up that the qanats are centuries old (some millennia), but implies they’ve been mostly damaged / neglected recently. My understanding is most of the old qanat network was degraded irreversibly during the Mongol invasions, partly out of direct destruction, partly out of lack of maintenance. Even after the Mongols, Iran’s population was less urbanized and so much smaller (it didn’t recover fully until the 1950s) that rebuilding a new network was never really feasible. 2. So new qanats today often have to be built from scratch, and what he doesn’t mention, is that you can’t really build them anywhere. You need just the right topography and springs in the right place relative to a population center. Like he does mention, they can also only provide a certain level of flow. With a large population under siege, the hard choice is to pull more water now with pumped wells, try to limit consumption downstream, and hopefully do things more sustainably once they’ve reached a strategic / economic stage closer to China or Russia (probably 1 more generation out). 3. I’m not a hydrologist, but IIUC many of the dams he mentions running almost empty were designed with that in mind. The Iranian government trains a lot of hydrologists, it does pay attention to climate models, and in particular, I think it expects a lot more extreme precipitation events around a drier average. The dams are staggered up in the highlands to retain water from wet / snowy years, not with any expectation of being close to full on average. 4. It still seems like way too many people haven’t realized that the Iranian government wants as many people to (gradually) abandon Tehran as possible. They aren’t going to plow their budget into saving a city they’ve already written off. Everyone assumes it’s going to be whacked with a giant earthquake eventually, plus it’s built right up against the Alborz so the air quality will never be great (imagine Boise during an inversion if 10 million people tried living there). And that’s before you get into all the weird cultural aspects of how the city relates to the rest of the country. File under Bondi Beach and narrative control.

He must really know what he is doing (and saying). That he got his wealth by hook and crook, and whether he believes in his own drivel is irrelevant; the governments that subsidize his endeavours, the public buying shares in them, the consumers acquiring the junk his firms produce, the press and other pundits transported into states of ectasy at his pronouncements — these are the true imbeciles. Agreed. If he’s an idiot (and he seemingly is) what does that say about everyone else? Same could be said about Trump. He’s clearly a dullard but apparently a slick salesman can climb their way to the top. We are truly a society of marks. I often think back to the NFT/Metaverse craze a few years ago. Was at SXSW in 2022 and it was like being at a massive cult rally as the KoolAid was being passed around. The bottom was already dropping out but everyone was spewing buzzwords, minting coins, and speaking abstractly about the new frontier they were pioneering. I thought, just maybe, in all the talks about presentations I’d garner a hint at some sort of tangible application for any of it but walked away from that experience certain of nothing but how empty it all was. Just hype and faith. But, one thing that seems to draw in legions of diehard acolytes is confident hype. People swoon to that like moths to a flame. I’ll never understand it. Anyone that speaks to me with unbridled confidence repels me like a used car salesman. But it works on the vast majority of humanity it seems. I don’t claim to be smarter than others, I just don’t like salesmen/preacher types. I prefer people who see the complexity of the world and doubt their own grasp of it. Yes, that is why this guy says this is and is not an AI bubble at the same time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh3d43DlBOU OpenAI and Xai are cults. I’ve dodged a metaphorical bullet by missing out on big tech jobs a decade or more ago. Watched friends and colleagues go to them. Facebook, Atlassian, slack, google. you don’t get hired, last or thrive in places like that if you question the orthodoxy or show signs of skepticism. they all know what game they’re playing – “big number get bigger”. might as well look for another job if you question it. the sad thing is they don’t always start that way. plenty of moral, ambitious, startups with talented curious skeptical people in them. but those start ups get absorbed by the tech-finance borg and… I think the country has always been like that, but there was a transition in corporate CEOs from engineering background to sales background to finance background. Where once competition was for things like market share, now it’s stock price, a measure far more removed from reality than whether the public likes the design, price and reliability of your cars. And if it’s even worse now, I wonder if it’s not an effect of the existential fear that I believe is creeping in on “little cat feet” throughout Western society. I hear people from my Millennial son to my Boomer friends talk about cutting themselves off from the news in order to avoid the anxiety and dread that seem to be building in the old “West” because of a combination social dissolution, economic instability, international chaos and an increasingly enraged Earth. Do we believe at some level that the confidence man must know something because somebody, somewhere must know something. Otherwise, it’s pretty hard to escape the conclusion that we’re screwed. Another thing I’ve observed about some “normie” types is that they’re desperate for some authority they can rely on. Some resort to traditional religion, the more conservative the better. Some bow the knee to Science as KLG discussed here. Technology and the Progress Myth may even be displacing Science as the sand upon which our society is built, so in such times as these, the Tech huckster has plenty of desperate marks. Yes an idiot. Being born wealthy and then being at the right time, right place takes no intelligence. And the real reason for his wealth, achieving TechBro cult status, he fell into. None of that was planned, and he just believes his own BS. I would add that from my brief time running with some rich and powerful (albeit on a much much lower rung of the ladder), they know so little about tech, and are even intimidated by it, so are incredibly easy to baffle and impress with bull$h1t when it comes to the areas Musk is in. It’s always felt like a lot of his success has been due to sounding intelligent to those who don’t know any better and them having FOMO if he turns out to be right. Astrophysicist and author, Adam Becker, in his book More Everything Forever, provides incisive, science based proofs as to the idiocy of Musk’s Martian fever dreams and other lunacies from Silicon Valley’s best and brightest.

Love it, Wuk. And when that song came out, I was a 14 year-old Midwest teenager wishing I was old enough to drive to check it out. Surely it was a mix of good and bad, but there were things happening like the Monterey Pop Festival, the Be-In, the Houseboat Summit and the kool-aid acid tests that I would like to have seen or participated in. Just the bands that were playing at the Fillmore or Monterey would have been amazing to see as they were forming and evolving. It would have been a different route. More New Buffalo Communes and fewer Waymos. Maybe your Burning Man, Wuk, preserves some part of that, but it seems to me we’re a lot closer to Dick’s and Scott’s vision of the future than the 60s San Francisco that MacKenzie was writing about. And I’ll throw in an Animals’ tune along the same lines. British bluesmen could dig the Summer of Love along with Americans. Thanks HMP, that song was crying out to be rearranged~ One thing about the 60’s is that money seemed to be irrelevant in all goings on, you could see a concert with 5 really good bands for a few bucks in the SF Bay area. Burning Man costs a bit for entry ticket and parking pass, and then money becomes ballast, in that the only thing you can buy on the playa is bags of ice, that’s it. So, it has some of that 60’s vibe going on, art for the sake of enjoyment-not enrichment. So Kagi came out with a game to help kids detect AI slop. There’s a sneaky group called the Slop Syndicate that’s trying to trick everyone! They use computers to make fake stories, pictures, and sounds that look real but aren’t. This is the state of the world in late 2025. We need a tool like this for kids to understand econo-priest speak as well, so that they can see through market worship. Anybody else notice the demise of the Xmas card? Used to get 30-35, up to 2 so far this season~ What, no tidings of DeJoy? I guess he is no longer in charge. I imagine that your cards will arrive with your 1098 and 1099’s at end of January. There apparently is a small groundswell emerging that some 2025 tax returns may be submitted- redacted. We really might run out of ink!! Same here. I still send ’em though. / ;) Mrs. Socialist makes me sign a bunch of hand-made cards every Christmas, but whether they get sent or not depends on if she can locate her address book in time. This Christmas it was a no, unfortunately. I had enough trouble just getting my gifts selected and purchased. I still have a few to go. Cards?!!??? remain beyond me yet another Christmas. I have not received any Christmas cards but I will send some next year if I can get my act together. I still send out some Solstice cards as I have for a half century I don’t send them out to get one back, just like making them and sending them out. For all of the attempts to destroy it, the USPS is still a great service. Denmark has solved that problem. You cannot send letters there anymore and they have removed all their mailboxes. You wanna send a Christmas card, send an email. But around here I noticed something more prosaic. Over the recent decades as friends and family pass away there is less and less people to send Christmas cards to so this year there are only a handful to send. Nobody told me that that would ever happen but I guess that it is inevitable. Same here. Many of the older generation I used to send cards to has passed on. The better half has decided we will switch to sending very pretty PDFs of Christmas cards that she designs. I really enjoyed watching the video embedded at the top of the links showing a traditional egg decorating technique. Thanks for sharing that. I also enjoyed the video. The work shown was amazingly precise showing the great skill of the person creating the egg. It looked like something to start practicing for next year’s Christmas. Technically the traditional egg decoration is for the Easter (spring, resurrection etc). Nothing really preventing one from doing for Christmas, though. It’s a living tradition so change, appropriation and assimilation do apply. Latest from Eric Salzman at Racket News. no paywall.

I’m speechless. I bet Xi is pissed. No magnets for Xmass… A drop in church attendance preceded the opioid epidemic: “Long before opioids flooded communities, something else was quietly changing—and it may have helped set the stage for today’s crisis. A new study finds that as church attendance dropped among middle-aged, less educated white Americans, deaths from overdoses, suicide, and alcohol-related disease began to rise. The trend started years before OxyContin appeared, suggesting the opioid epidemic intensified a problem already underway.” https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251219093317.htm Maybe some independent factor caused both the drop in attendance and the opioid epidemic. Or maybe a fair number of people are better off attending church than not, no matter how wart-ridden the church inevitably is or what they believe. I’m not sure how one would set up a study to determine which it is. I would add that too many of the preachers in these congregations served neither to educate their parishioners to some of the realities of their existence nor did they advocate publicly for their interests. Instead, many of their preachers reinforced the status quo that was crushing these people with their preaching and considered themselves upstanding members of their local communities in terms of their memberships and friendships. First, the church often left them. Losing that membership in the community may well have been an important contributor to the epidemic. It wasn’t weekly exposure to the preaching of fire and brimstone. Spiritual Fitness Inventory User Guide US Army Public Health Command, Technical Guide No. 360 [2012] Even if a particular church left people, they could have still gone to a different church, or formed a new one. In many denominations the members choose their own pastor (or in the case of my denomination, have no paid pastor; everyone is a pastor). I’m not convinced that the cause was bad pastors. It seems like a little much to expect some one person to “educate” parishioners to the realities of their existence; I wouldn’t expect that of a pastor even if my denomination had them. I’m just not sure why people stopped attending. In my part of the country I did see social snobbery being a factor; religion was seen as being for the uneducated. Lack of community and peer to peer support in a world of neoliberalism and unaffordable or underfunded social services is a recipe for disaster. I don´t sympathize with that claim at least at its face value. There were also anecdotes where in the light of lacking support from state (as DEA colluded with Purdue) victims turned to church where prayers were supposed to solve the problem of addiction! The thing that did the trick was organizing and the FBI connecting the dots, to my knowledge. That doesn´t mean “church” doesn´t help in certain context. But then “church” is just the representation for something else. Call it solidarity, call it community organising, local social services. It´s risky to think religion helps where in fact it is serious shortcomings and corruption in rich societies. In fact Purdue abused such indicators as poverty or “decency” to claim why victims of Oxy had become addicted. NOT actually Oxy. That´s is not unlike claiming “well it´s all due to the loss of values that our kids are taking drugs”. i.e. it´s their fault. The less solidarity in a society because its dismantled by its elites the more religion is supposed to step in. Eventually an Emmanuel Todd says that the demise of religion is directly connectet with the demise of societies. I.don´t.think.so. Forgive me but to cease this dependency on religion as it was established in the Soviet system was progressive achievement. (it was other issues that didn´t work.) Thanks for the link. From the article: “The researchers found a clear pattern at the state level. States that experienced the sharpest drops in church attendance between 1985 and 2000 also saw the largest increases in deaths from these causes during the same period.” Now what else was happening in the US during that time period – 1985 to 2000? My very first thought is that was when the big push to move factory jobs offshore or from northern states more expensive labor to southern states less expensive labor, the difference being the rate of factory labor unionization between northern and southern states. Moving manufacturing to Mexico and Vietnam and later to China. People were told to move from places like Detroit and Dearborn to places where the work was. Or told to accept lower wages or the company would move the factory jobs to another state or to another country. Either accept lower wages or quit and ‘learn to code’. Working class people were economically whipsawed by this threat for many years. People were uprooted, displaced, financially distressed, and moving into a new community when feeling desperate, maybe a second or third move, could I imagine leave one in a state of turmoil. Finding a new church to attend and join might have been the last thing on the mind if wondering just how long one might live in the new city. Shorter, it started during the Reagan years of outsourcing and downsizing that put families on the move looking for work. / my 2 cents And putting too fine a point on this, I’m thinking of the US’s internal great migration of farmers and farm labor, dispossessed of their farms and labor during the Great Depression, on a constant move looking for work. I don’t think many of them looked to join a new church during those terrible years when they were on the move. No stability, no knowing how long they’d be in any place if they did find work. Dorothea Lange made a series of famous photos for the Farm Security Administration in FDR’s administration. You’d recognize the pictures. Search on the term “Dorothea Lange”. But church attendance dropped among people who stayed put. And it dropped in areas like my home region of New England that weren’t affected in the same way by Reaganomics. And it used to be that when people moved to a new area the first thing they did was look for a church for support. I agree about the badness of Reagonomics and its dislocations but I think there may be something more. Pretty sure Space X gets a tax wright off for the CyberTrucks. That will be some form 179. Here I was wrestling with the older eurovans clocking in below 6K GVW. It’s all a matter of scale, no? With Elroy, it is almost also like a stock-buy-back. My bet: He got a discount-to-MSRP ro deal, books the sale, never pays a penny, sells to Guvvy for their Venezuelan ground transpo at 150 % of MSRP (Military Pro deal) , but graciously throws in solar charge stations. So many headlines to anticipate for 2026!! Maybe that will offset the cost of exploding rockets. / heh. RE: Roomba’s and ebikes. . . Rad ebikes dominate the ebike category in my town. They start at $1k for the model parents are buying for their kids (as young as 9 y.o.). The town council has now created administrative fines for the reckless riding the youngsters create. The fines are payable by the parents. Needless to say this market for ebikes is shrinking. Older adults buy the more expensive models, but after less than a year realize an ebike is the prey for distracted automobile drivers. One local dealer told me that 40% of buyers want help selling their purchase in the first year of ownership. (I own an expensive Class 3 ebike that is stored in the City run Bike Spot indoor parking; there are ebikes next to mine that have not been ridden in the last 6 months.) It’s not just the tariffs that are depressing the market. E-bikes are so dangerous in the hands of a kid or adult, as I see them rather silently almost keeping up with cagers, often in their blind spot. In Brooklyn they are known to burn down buildings due to off market chargers and lithium batteries. There’s a reason why some people don’t park their Tesla in the garage. It does seem I see fewer ebikes on my trails these days. And on the street even motorcycles are quite dangerous because of the visibility problem. “They graduated from Stanford. Due to AI, they can’t find a job – Los Angeles Times” This is a complete farce. AI is not replacing people. AI is not responsible for new grads being unable to find tech jobs. It’s Indians. Indians and other mass migrants via fraudulent visas. This is congruent with the adage that AI means “Actually, Indians”. Ukraine Receives Last of 80 Promised Abrams Tanks: How Many Are Left and How Well Can They Be Sustained? Military Watch I’m calling bullshit. No-one is signing off sending 80 $25 million turbine powered tanks to be obliterated by 200 $1500 drones within 96 hours. The total budget for the endless drone destruction music videos and edits over the next 5 years remixes won’t even exceed the paperwork budget for shipping this many tanks into Ukraine. It makes more sense to relegate the tanks to bulldozer duty behind the lines than to do this. Probably they are being shipped somewhere else, or being sold by the Ukrainians to someone else, or are for conquering Poland. I simply cannot believe even the Nato MIC would send this much (relatively) good hardware in after bad. I doubt that those tanks are for the present conflict. Instead, they will be the nucleus of a more powerful tank force for the Ukrainian army that will be built up after the Russians sign Minsk 3. Then when NATO gets its planned 2030 war against Russia, they will be at the forefront of the new attack against the Russians. Now we just need to have the Russians cooperate more… re: Protonmail leaves Switzerland use google-tranlsate Proton leaves Switzerland: CEO warns of surveillance state https://tarnkappe.info/artikel/it-sicherheit/datenschutz/proton-verlaesst-die-schweiz-ceo-warnt-vor-ueberwachungsstaat-324338.html “Proton has begun relocating its infrastructure from Switzerland.

Title: Job seekers in 2025 faced a Great Frustration: never-ending applications, ghosting after interviews, and losing hope

Call it the Great Freeze — or the Great Frustration. Business Insider spoke with dozens of job seekers across generations in 2025, some of whom have been unemployed for more than a year. They voiced a wide range of frustrations about their searches — including slow hiring timelines, so-called "ghost jobs," suspected ageism, employers going silent midway through the process, overwhelming competition for each role, and the belief that AI filters are often screening their résumés before a human ever sees them. Their job-finding journeys come at a time when employers are hiring at one of the lowest rates since 2013. Whether the job seekers blame AI, corporate efficiency pushes, or broader economic uncertainty, they say it all adds up to a deluge of applications and a dearth of job offers. Still, through the frustration, they've also found ways to cope and connect with a community of fellow job seekers. "I believe the hiring system is broken," said Matthew English, who's been looking for full-time work since October 2024 after a decadeslong career in accounting. Despite applying for hundreds of jobs — from accounting roles to the Chick-fil-A cow mascot — he's been unable to secure a full-time offer. He said he's burned through much of his savings, and that last Christmas, he couldn't afford to buy gifts for his family. "I have about drained my life's savings," said English, who is in his 60s and lives in Alabama. "Money that you're expecting to use in retirement is now being used to survive." The New York Fed regularly asks people to estimate the likelihood that, if they lost their job today, they'd be able to find a new one in the next three months. In August 2025, that average probability dropped to its lowest level since the survey began in 2013 — and has only recovered slightly in the months since. Kory Kantenga, the head of economics for the Americas at LinkedIn, said 2025's labor market had "low momentum." "The cumulative effect of three years of slowdown — it's completely understandable why they feel like this might be the worst labor market they've ever been in," Kantenga said. Throughout the year, Business Insider has spoken with people who've worked at some of the world's most high-profile companies and found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations. Share your story by emailing jzinkula@businessinsider.com or mhoff@businessinsider.com. Read more on the topic: Hilary Nordland began looking for work after being laid off from her marketing role in July 2024. To help pay the bills, she said she started donating plasma and drew on her retirement savings. Nordland, who's in her 50s and lives in Minnesota, said one of the most frustrating parts of her job search has been landing interviews — only to have opportunities fall through for unexpected reasons. She said she's had interviews canceled the same day they were scheduled because the role was suddenly put on hold or filled internally. On one occasion, she said, an HR representative told her she'd be a great fit — but the rep was fired before they could schedule the interview. "This job market is terrifying," she said. "It's a black hole that makes you question everything — and I don't see a clear path through." US employers have announced 1.17 million job cuts so far in 2025, the most since 2020. While the unemployment rate remains relatively low by historical standards, it has risen to its highest level since 2021, when the economy was still recovering from pandemic-related disruptions. High demand for jobs — combined with the rise of AI-assisted applications — has contributed to an influx of submissions for open roles, making it harder for qualified candidates to stand out. Last quarter, the average job posting received 242 applications, nearly three times the number in 2017, according to data from Greenhouse, a hiring software provider. Aaron Terrazas, an independent economist, said job seekers' frustration with this year's labor market was justified. "Just because the aggregate jobs data look stable, steady, slowing but stable, doesn't mean that it hasn't been very difficult for some people," Terrazas said. Heather Driscoll began looking for a healthcare management job after being laid off last year. She said she's struggled to pay the bills and had to draw on her 401(k). "The amount of time, research, enthusiasm — the dressing up, hair, makeup — just to sit on a Zoom call and get no feedback or rejection, is insane," she said. Driscoll, who's in her 50s and lives in Colorado, said she has reached the final interview round multiple times but has been unable to secure an offer. She suspects that ageism and sexism could be working against her. A challenging job market has forced some job seekers to confront the possibility that their goals and aspirations may be out of reach. At age 40, Kenneth Ferraro quit his job as a truck driver to pursue a bachelor's degree in political science at New York University. He hoped it would set him up for a career in public service — but after struggling to find work, he returned to trucking last year. He said he's stuck with more than $100,000 in student debt. While having a college degree improved his credentials, Ferraro said he thought his age had held him back in the job market. He recalled applying for an entry-level government position that seemed like a good fit. The early stages of the interview process felt promising, but he said things shifted after the in-person interview — and he suspects his age was a factor. "As soon as the hiring manager saw me, his whole demeanor changed," Ferraro said. "He ran through the questions and never truly engaged with me." Solomon Jones hoped that earning a college degree would open doors. After earning his bachelor's degree in sports communication in May, he struggled to find employment. Jones said that some of the sports communications job postings he'd come across had attracted more than 1,000 applicants. "The goal is to obviously get a job in the sports industry, but realistically, I know that life isn't fair," said Jones, who's in his 20s and lives in New Jersey. "So at this point, I'm just trying to find a job, period." Some job seekers Business Insider spoke with have leaned on others — including friends, family, professional contacts, and fellow job seekers — for support and solidarity during their job searches. After being laid off by Microsoft in May, Ian Carter struggled to find a new job. He switched to a month-to-month lease on his Redmond, Washington, apartment, but eventually moved to Florida to save money by living with family while continuing his search. Carter said he's connected with others who've lost their jobs and visits the private "MSFT Survivors" Facebook group, which includes people who've been laid off throughout Microsoft's history. "Layoffs kind of affect people mentally," said Carter, who's in his 30s. "I've reached out to people so we can be each other's support system." In July, Sriram Ramkrishna was laid off by Intel for the second time. On his last official day with the company, his wife also lost her job. When he learned the news, his mindset shifted from "I'll find a job when I can" to "I'd better find a job." But over the past few months, he's struggled to make much headway. Ramkrishna said one of the things keeping him going is the support of his former Intel colleagues, who also lost their jobs. "Many of us have been helping each other with our job searches — sharing opportunities and offering support," said Ramkrishna, who's in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon. "It feels like we're all looking out for each other." Chris Martin, lead researcher at Glassdoor, said uncertainty helped drive this year's low-fire, low-hire job market, such as businesses navigating the effects of tariffs and AI. Terrazas, the independent economist, doesn't think uncertainty will fully fade next year, but said employers won't be facing the initial shock of policy changes from a new administration. Most job seekers can't afford to put their searches on hold until conditions improve. Despite the challenges, some have managed to break through. When Alexander Valen was laid off from his project manager role at Accenture, he was initially optimistic that his more than two decades of experience would help him land a new job. But after nearly two years of job searching — and falling behind on his mortgage — that optimism had vanished. Valen, who's in his 50s and lives in Florida, said he and his wife, a stay-at-home mom, relied on DoorDash earnings, unemployment benefits, and help from family to get by. But a few months ago, someone in his network recommended he explore roles at the freelance platform Toptal. Valen applied for a project manager role, went through the interview process, and landed the position, which he said fell within the $80 to $100 an hour compensation range he'd been targeting. Valen's top advice for other job seekers: Reframe how you view the process — and lean on others along the way. "The search becomes far less discouraging when you treat it as an opportunity to grow rather than a verdict on your worth," he said. "And in a market this competitive, networking isn't optional — it's the force multiplier that ultimately led me to my role." Jump to

December 21, 2025 03:04 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA MAHIA, New Zealand, Dec. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its 21st Electron rocket of the year to deploy the latest satellite to space for multi-launch customer Institute for Q-shu Pioneers of Space, Inc. (iQPS), a Japan-based Earth imaging company. ‘The Wisdom God Guides’ mission launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on December 21 at 7:36 p.m. (06:36 UTC) to deploy the QPS-SAR-15 to space for iQPS. The spacecraft will join the company’s synthetic aperture radar (SAR) constellation providing near-real time imagery across twelve different orbits for iQPS’ global customers. Rocket Lab first launched for iQPS in 2023 and has gone on to deploy seven satellites to the iQPS constellation, making Electron the primary launcher for iQPS. A further five launches on Electron for iQPS are planned from 2026. Today’s mission has set a new annual launch record for Electron: 21 launches in one year with 100% mission success. The record cements Electron as both America’s preeminent small launch provider and the world’s most frequently-launched small-lift orbital rocket. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “Congratulations to iQPS on this latest successful mission for their constellation, and to the Rocket Lab team on a fantastic record-setting year of Electron launches. Electron makes frequent and reliable launch look easy as it outpaces all other American small-lift orbital rockets, year after year. In 2026, we’re expanding Electron’s global reach with more multi-launch constellation deployments, dedicated missions for domestic civil space and international space agencies in Japan and Europe, and both suborbital and orbital launches with defense applications for hypersonic technology and national security. Our new record of annual launches and the breadth of upcoming missions go to show how much of a global impact Electron continues to have on the space industry, and we’re looking forward to another year of continued execution in 2026.” ‘The Wisdom God Guides’ mission was Rocket Lab’s 79th overall Electron mission and final scheduled launch for 2025. The next Electron launch is slated to take place in early Q1 2026. ‘The Wisdom God Guides’ launch images: F79 | The Wisdom God Guides ‘The Wisdom God Guides’ launch broadcast: Rocket Lab - ‘The Wisdom God Guides’ Launch Rocket Lab Media ContactMurielle Bakermedia@rocketlabusa.com About Rocket LabRocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.
