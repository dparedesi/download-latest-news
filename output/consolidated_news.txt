FirstRand's significant retail investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public The top 25 shareholders own 44% of the company Institutions own 38% of FirstRand Every investor in FirstRand Limited (JSE:FSR) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are retail investors with 47% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Meanwhile, institutions make up 38% of the company’s shareholders. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of FirstRand. View our latest analysis for FirstRand Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that FirstRand does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at FirstRand's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. FirstRand is not owned by hedge funds. Public Investment Corporation Limited is currently the largest shareholder, with 15% of shares outstanding. Bee Partners, LLC is the second largest shareholder owning 4.9% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 3.7% of the company stock. On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of FirstRand Limited in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own R1.6b of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 47% stake in FirstRand. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Title: China Puts Investor Patience to Test as Key Meeting Underwhelms

(Bloomberg) -- China’s highly anticipated Finance Ministry briefing on Saturday lacked the firepower that equity investors had hoped for, indicating that the volatility that’s gripped the market following a world-beating rally will likely extend. Most Read from Bloomberg Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Chicago Marathon to Honor Kenyan Who Died After His World Record While Finance Minister Lan Fo’an promised more support for the struggling property sector and hinted at greater government borrowing to shore up the economy, the briefing didn’t produce a headline dollar figure for fresh fiscal stimulus that the markets had sought. A lack of new incentives to boost consumption, which has been a weak link in the economy, is another reason why traders may feel disappointed. The ministry “tried its best,” but there is a large gap between what was announced and what the market was expecting, said Shen Meng, a director at Beijing-based boutique investment bank Chanson & Co. “So the overall sentiment for investors is negative.” Patience has been wearing thin among investors, who have clamored for Beijing to announce big-bang fiscal measures to help sustain the rally sparked by the stimulus blitz that authorities unleashed in late September. The CSI 300 Index, a benchmark of onshore equities, capped its biggest weekly loss since late July on Friday, with volatility rising ahead of the MOF briefing. The Australian and New Zealand dollars, proxies for China sentiment among developed market currencies, both slipped 0.2% in early trading Monday. A further unwinding of the rally risks fueling concern that equities are heading for yet another false dawn, which may bring more selling pressure. The market has been caught in a start-stop cycle of gains and losses a few times before as Beijing’s piecemeal approach to stimulus produced only brief rebounds. Local governments will be allowed to issue special bonds to buy unsold homes and turn them into subsidized housing, Lan and his deputies said on Saturday, while refraining from putting a price tag on any additional stimulus. Lan also hinted at room for issuing more sovereign bonds and greater government spending, steps that could be announced later this month or early November. Prior to the weekend, investors and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected China to deploy as much as 2 trillion yuan ($283 billion) in fresh fiscal stimulus on Saturday, including potential subsidies, consumption vouchers and financial support for families with children. “The room for further fiscal stimulus is still on the table,” said Britney Lam, head of long-short equities for Magellan Investments Holdings Ltd. In the meantime, “markets will likely see further profit taking,” she said. Inflation data released on Sunday is likely to add to investor concerns. It showed that China’s consumer prices rose less than forecast in September, while factory-gate charges fell for a 24th straight month, underscoring the need for further policy support to help the economy break out of deflation. The CSI 300 Index slid 3.3% last week, but it’s still up 21% from its close on Sept. 23, the day before China’s central bank announced a broad package of measures that included an interest-rate cut and liquidity support for the equity market. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index lost 6.6% last week after surging more than 30% in the previous three weeks. While the epic rebound in Chinese shares has spurred the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. to upgrade the market, it has also drawn skepticism from others such as Invesco Ltd. and Morgan Stanley who say stocks have already run too far too fast. “I’m still a little bit disappointed,” said Kenny Wen, head of investment strategy at KGI Asia Ltd. While the finance minister announced some specific measures, the ‘timing and amount’ were still missing. What’s Next? Investors will soon turn attention to the next major policy briefing in the coming weeks — from the Communist Party-controlled parliament that oversees the budget — for details of more stimulus. At its October meeting last year, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress approved additional sovereign debt and raised the budget-deficit ratio. China’s sovereign bonds were little changed on the measures announced on Saturday. By noon on the day, the 10-year yield had erased an earlier drop of as much as two basis points, according to traders, who asked not to be identified as they are not allowed to comment publicly on the rates market. A strengthened fiscal push would likely weigh on China’s bonds by encouraging traders to move funds into riskier investments with potentially better returns. An increased supply of debt may also sap liquidity in the financial system, making it harder for the market to absorb the entire amount. The yield curve will probably move lower, given debt issuance this year may come below market consensus, said Zhaopeng Xing, a senior strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. Going forward, “we expect 1 trillion yuan of ultra-long treasury and 1 trillion yuan of local bonds to be announced,” he added. --With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi, Zhu Lin, Wenjin Lv, Shuiyu Jing, April Ma, Matthew Burgess, Michael G.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) stands against the other trending AI stocks. As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.

Title: Cardano Whales Move $6 Billion In One Day, Fuel For ADA Price To Reach $0.5?

Time Published: 2024-10-12T20:30:36Z

In an interesting move, Cardano (ADA) has rebounded by almost 4% in the past 24 hours, in what seems to be an uptick in activity among large ADA holders. The price of ADA started the week on a bearish note and spent the majority of the week trending downwards. Particularly, the ADA price fell by about 9.5% to bottom out at $0.33260. However, the crypto has rebounded and has increased by about 6% from this low. This price rebound was accompanied by a large transaction volume, especially from large holders, also known as whales. According to data from IntoTheBlock (ITB), this transaction volume amounted to 17.33 billion ADA, worth about $6 billion. The Large Transaction Volume metric from IntoTheBlock tracks details on transactions with a value of $100,000 or greater. Interestingly, this metric puts the worth of whale transactions at $24.18 billion in the past seven days, a notable increase from last week’s readings. A huge part of these transactions were recorded in the past three days, with $6 billion movements coming on October 11 and $5.8 billion on October 10. The uptick in whale activity appears to be closely linked to ongoing developments within the Cardano ecosystem. According to a recent report from InputOutput, Cardano has remained a major hub for blockchain developers, especially following the recent node upgrades to v.9.2.0 and the subsequent v.9.2.1. InputOutput’s data reveals that by the end of September, there were 1,376 active projects being built on Cardano, underscoring its popularity among blockchain innovators. Additionally, during September, the number of minted native tokens grew by 80,000, while the total number of transactions on the network surged by 1.34 million. ADA’s price action has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks, and sentiment among investors has been more negative than usual, especially on social media. Cardano’s creator, Charles Hoskinson, addressed this sentiment on social media platform X. Hoskinson clarified that the negative outlook doesn’t reflect any failure on Cardano’s part, emphasizing that the project continues to grow. He also took the opportunity to criticize other crypto ecosystems, remarking that Cardano remains one of the few cryptocurrencies still committed to being a true decentralized currency, unlike those aligning with corporate giants like BlackRock and Wall Street. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: $1.83 Billion Makes Its Way To Exchanges, Is A Bloodbath Coming? Despite the pessimism, the ADA price has managed to hold a key support level at $0.33, which offers some relief to bullish investors. Additionally, on-chain metrics such as net network growth and positive momentum in the futures market suggest a more optimistic outlook. The recent uptick in whale activity could signal the beginning of a more sustained rise for the ADA price. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.354. The first target is a significant break above $0.40 before a return to $0.50.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) stands against the other trending AI stocks. As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.

Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.

Let’s do this. Tesla finally revealed its Cybercab robotaxi. Unveiled at the company’s We, Robot event, the Cybercab looks like a smaller, sleeker, two-seater Cybertruck — and the company claims it’ll cost less than $30,000.

Title: Mark Harmon Explains Why His Son Isn't Returning To Play Young Gibbs On NCIS: Origins

Time Published: 2024-10-12T20:01:53Z

Your changes have been saved Email is sent Email has already been sent Please verify your email address. You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics. NCIS: Origins executive producer and narrator Mark Harmon explains why his son, Sean, isn't returning as Young Gibbs. Set to premiere on CBS in just a matter of days, NCIS: Origins is the first prequel in the history of the NCIS franchise. It follows Leroy Jethro Gibbs in the early 1990s. Although Sean Harmon is involved behind the scenes in the new show, he won't be appearing on camera. Instead, Bridge of Spies actor Austin Stowell steps into the lead role. Speaking with Variety, ahead of the premiere of NCIS: Origins on Monday, October 14, at 10 PM ET on CBS, Harmon clarified why Sean won't be reprising his role as Young Gibbs in the prequel. Even though Harmon played Gibbs in the main series, and has been credited with coming up with the pitch for NCIS: Origins, the older Harmon clarified that his son is focused on different things and enjoys executive producing. Read the quote below: “He’s an actor, writer, producer, a surfer, he does a lot of things. You have to come to decisions about what you want to do in life, or what you think’s important. I just think he made a choice and had to make a decision in some ways. He likes executive producing.” The new NCIS prequel puts the spotlight on Gibbs as he's just beginning his career as a Special Agent at NCIS' Camp Pendleton office. He intends to build up a gritty team, with the support of another legacy character, Mike Franks, who has been played in the main show by Muse Watson. It's a different version of Gibbs than the one the franchise viewers will recognize, at least in terms of the NCIS: Origins cast Gibbs is surrounded by. Though there are a few familiar faces, there are several more new ones. NCIS: Origins: Cast & Characters Actor Who They're Playing Notes Austin Stowell Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs The main protagonist of the prequel. Mariel Molino Special Agent Lala Dominguez The female lead and potential love interest for Gibbs. Kyle Schmid Special Agent Mike Franks Leader of the team. Tyla Abercrumbie Field Operation Support Officer Mary Jo Sullivan Self-described “Head Secretary in Charge.” Diany Rodriguez Special Agent Vera Strickland Franks' partner in the original NCIS. Daniel Bellomy Special Agent Granville "Granny" Dawson A young probationary agent. Caleb Martin Foote Special Agent Benjamin “Randy” Randolf The agency's lovable golden boy. Robert Taylor Jackson Gibbs Gibbs' father. Patrick Fischler NCIS Special Agent in Charge Cliff Walker Walker oversees the fledgling NIS Pendleton Office. Julian Black Antelope Chief Medical Examiner Kai Blackrock Blackrock works at the San Diego County M.E.’s Office. Lori Petty Dr. Lenora Friedman A pathologist at the San Diego Medical Examiner’s Office. Bobby Moynihan Woodrow “Woody” Browne Director of the NIS Forensic Lab. Mark Harmon Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (as narrator) Also executive producer. In one of his few major acting roles, Sean Harmon appeared in seven episodes of NCIS, appearing in seasons 6, 7, 9, and 18. By bringing in Stowell, the high-profile prequel will honor NCIS continuity. But it will also signal to viewers that this is a somewhat distinct version of Gibbs that won't simply retread the ground that's been covered in flashbacks. It invites viewers in, with one argument being that audiences wouldn't necessarily have to follow the main NCIS to enjoy the prequel. NCIS: Origins recently cast its new Jethro Gibbs, and this casting is all the more exciting considering the actor’s previous action show success. In any case, even though Sean Harmon is not the lead actor, he's very much part of the show's creative team. Mark and Sean share executive producer credits alongside David J. North and Gina Lucita Monreal. The latter duo will also co-write the premiere episode and serve as showrunners, joined by those heavily involved in the main NCIS. So, while there may be a different Gibbs at the center of the story, the same writing force and vision are present. Even though the reasons are only implied by Harmon, it takes a lot to be the lead of a high profile series. That's both in terms of the work itself and hours filming, but also things like promotional tours and being the face of the brand. All of this might have contributed to CBS and Sean Harmon wanting to go in a different direction. But it also allows NCIS: Origins a better chance of standing on its own terms. Source: Variety Your comment has not been saved A young Gibbs embarks on his journey as a Naval Investigative Service agent in the early 1990s. Set against the backdrop of Camp Pendleton, the series explores Gibbs' formative years, the cases that shaped him, and the mentors who guided his path, including Mike Franks. Your changes have been saved Email is sent Email has already been sent Please verify your email address. You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics. We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved Finally!!! I’ve been anxiously awaiting this show since its announcement back in January. I hope it lives up to expectations- I’m betting it will! The story continues......no how the story, the legend, the reputation became as respected as He is. Looking forward to the development of how the GIBBS RULES came into being..... especially rules 9 and 12 I have watched every episode on NCIS since the beginning. Can't wait until tomorrow to start watching the new series. Best wishes for a successful Show Arnold Sheir NCIS: Origins' core cast has already been confirmed, but there's one more actor that the CBS prequel needs to feature for it to succeed. White Collar has one of the most compelling pilot episodes of any series, and it's because of a bizarre choice made by one of the leading characters. Daryl Dixon season 2 hits its midway point with a slightly slower episode that focuses on the villains, setting up Carol and Daryl’s imminent reunion. The official runtime for Gladiator 2 runs just a few minutes short of Ridley Scott's original 2000 epic movie, which was two hours and 35 minutes. The Star Wars movies and TV shows have often referenced midi-chlorians and "M-counts", but what are they and how do they connect to the Force? One Cowboy Bebop episode reveals the true standout of the series, shedding light on the character who best defines its emotional core and depth. Adam Brody's role as Rabbi Noah in Nobody Wants This is a reminder of how excellent he could have been had he stayed on Gilmore Girls longer.

Adam Norwitt, CEO of the firm, highlighted the surge in bookings between March and June during the company's Q2 earnings call.

Title: Troubled retailers face a Halloween crunch with consumers spending less
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/troubled-retailers-face-halloween-crunch-190000616.html
Time Published: 2024-10-12T19:00:00Z

(Bloomberg) -- A predicted slide in Halloween consumption is the latest blow for heavily-indebted retailers battling mounting overheads and the trend of consumers trading down to cheaper products. Most Read from Bloomberg Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Chicago Marathon to Honor Kenyan Who Died After His World Record US spending for the holiday will drop by 5% to $11.6 billion this year, according to the National Retail Federation. Sales of greeting cards and costumes are likely to see the greatest decline, a hit to merchants reliant on seasonal splurges in what’s already been a tough year for the industry. Households on the lower end of the income scale are broadly struggling as unemployment has edged higher this year and underlying inflation has remained persistently high. Retailer Michaels Cos. said on a recent earnings call that households earning less than $100,000 are retrenching, resulting in lower basket sizes. “2024 has been a perfect storm for retailers of all stripes,” said Erica Weisgerber, a partner at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. “Inflation, high operational costs, and reduced consumer spending have been especially challenging for brick-and-mortar retailers, and online retailers have struggled with steep competition from e-commerce giants like Amazon.” Many of the troubled firms, including Michaels and At Home Group Inc., are owned by private equity managers after buyouts during the pandemic proved ill-timed when interest rates rose and inflation crimped household budgets. Home, clothing and hobby retailers dominate the list of distressed retailers because the size of their debt means they lack the liquidity to compete with better capitalized competitors, according to Moody’s Ratings. Still, Michaels and At Home are hopeful that they can win a larger slice of the holiday spending. Hellman & Friedman LLC’s At Home saw a strong start to Halloween spending after flat second-quarter net sales of about $443 million, chief financial officer Jerry Murray said on a September earnings call. Apollo Global Management Inc.’s Michaels also saw a revenue pop tied to Halloween as customers began to buy inventory earlier this year, according to people on last month’s earnings call. That’s a fillip for the firm whose earnings declined by about 20% to $50 million in the second quarter from a year earlier, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Apollo and Hellman & Friedman declined to comment. The pullback is creating challenges for the wider industry and has contributed to several high-profile bankruptcies this year, including Joann Inc., Big Lots Inc. and Conn’s Inc. It also makes it harder to turn around firms simply by slashing costs. “Retailers are finding that their low-hanging efficiency efforts do not go far enough,” said Holly Etlin, a partner in AlixPartners’ turnaround practice. With capital markets shunning troubled firms, more retailers turned to bankruptcy rather than distressed exchanges over the past year as the companies require deeper restructuring that is best done in court, Moody’s Ratings said in a report last month. It’s part of a wider trend that saw quarterly filings for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection rise to the highest level since 2012 in the three months through June. Private equity’s widespread failure to hedge against rising borrowing costs also means it’s less able to come to the rescue of troubled firms, which could have knock-on effects for the economy and jobs. “The private equity players that often have backstopped retailers have been in a new deal lull as multiples collapsed and rates for leveraged deals skyrocketed,” said James Gellert, executive chair at risk analytics provider RapidRatings International Inc. Listen here to the Credit Edge podcast on Schroders’ bullish outlook on CRE private debt Week in Review China’s onshore high-yield debt market this week suffered its worst day of trading in years as investors pulled money out of bonds and poured it into stocks in response to government stimulus. Meanwhile, domestic developer Country Garden Holdings Co. missed a self-imposed target date for getting key creditor support for terms of its restructuring plan. Inflows to private credit funds helped BlackRock Inc. pull in a record $221 billion of total client cash last quarter, bringing the world’s largest money manager to an all-time high of $11.5 trillion of assets. A potential bidding war for HPS Investment Partners is set to swell the fortunes of its three founders as rival groups vie for a piece of the red-hot private credit market. A group of private credit firms including 26North Partners are closing in on a deal to lend to Vista Equity Partners-backed Alegeus Technologies, after the software firm tried to refinance existing debt with a new leveraged loan. Banks led by UBS Group AG sold $1 billion of leveraged loans to help finance Vista Equity Partners’ buyout of software company Jaggaer, the market’s latest acquisition deal to include a second-lien component. In Europe, Blackstone Inc. is investing in a C$1.125 billion ($822 million) second-lien tranche that is helping finance AutoScout24’s purchase of Canadian online car marketplace Trader. K2 Insurance Services sold a bigger-than-planned leveraged loan as the firm cuts borrowing costs on buyout-related financing by three percentage points. Verizon Communications Inc. lined up $10 billion of short-term bank funding to help finance its purchase of Frontier Communications Parent Inc. If cut to junk status, Boeing Co. will be the biggest US corporate borrower to ever be stripped of its investment-grade ratings and join junk bond indexes, flooding the high-yield market with a record volume of new debt to absorb. A market for aircraft bonds that all but shut down after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is showing signs of life again. Japan’s Norinchukin Bank got a vote of confidence from bond investors on Wednesday, when spreads on the firm’s first dollar issuance since it revealed massive losses tightened significantly in secondary trading. Gritstone Bio Inc., a vaccine developer that once touted its ability to make a next-generation Covid-19 shot, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware. Avante Health Solutions filed for bankruptcy in order to sell its business to an affiliate of private equity firm Staple Street Capital. On the Move John Abate, partner and co-head of trading at Silver Point Capital, is set to retire by the end of the year after more than 15 years at the hedge fund. Wells Fargo & Co. is hiring Celine Catherin from Deutsche Bank AG as a managing director and co-head of its leveraged syndicate. Joshua Baumgarten, co-managing partner and head of credit at TPG Angelo Gordon, is leaving the firm after its purchase last year by TPG Inc. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has hired Mike Shanahan from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as a managing director in its technology leveraged finance team. Corinthia Global Management has recruited three more people from Barings after poaching a 22-strong team from the US asset manager earlier this year. The trio are Louis Godest, Christel Huguet and Jan Lübke. JPMorgan Chase & Co. veteran Doug Kravitz joined M3 Partners as a managing director focused on advising company creditors in restructuring scenarios. Barclays Plc has promoted Harry Mateer to head of Americas fixed income, currencies and commodities research.

Title: BlackRock Is Selling Bitcoin To Buy Ethereum, Will This Bullishness Trigger Another Altcoin Season?

Time Published: 2024-10-12T17:30:34Z

New reports have revealed that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and American multinational investment company, is now selling Bitcoin (BTC) to buy Ethereum (ETH). Many market watchers propose that this unexpected investment change could trigger a bullish rally for Ethereum, potentially catalyzing another altcoin season. Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics tool has uncovered a shocking new transaction executed by asset manager, BlackRock. In its official X (formerly Twitter) account, Lookonchain disclosed that BlackRock has recently sold off 182 BTC, valued at $11.34 million. Around the same period, the blockchain analytics tool recorded BlackRock purchasing 7,574 ETH tokens, worth approximately $18.52 million. This surprising development indicates a potential shift in BlackRock’s investment strategy, hinting at the investment giant’s newfound favor in Ethereum. As the world’s largest Bitcoin fund, BlackRock’s decision to dump Bitcoin for Ethereum comes as a shock to many crypto community members, with discussions flooding the space about the real reason behind the asset manager’s investment decision. According to some market watchers, BlackRock’s move is a reflection of its clients’ digital asset preferences, as the asset manager could be selling Bitcoin and buying Ethereum based on client requests. Other crypto community members are seeing BlackRock’s investment move as a sign that the price of Ethereum could be gearing up for a substantial rally. As the number one altcoin in the market with the largest market capitalization, a massive price rally for Ethereum could potentially trigger the long-awaited altcoin season. Historically, a price increase in Ethereum paves the way for other altcoins in the market to see similarly bullish gains. With the market already expecting a significant altcoin season in this bull cycle, BlackRock’s unexpected investment move is fueling speculation in the market about a potential Ethereum price surge that could outperform Bitcoin. As of writing, BlackRock‘s holding reveals a strong preference for Bitcoin in terms of value. Data from Lookonchain reveals that BlackRock holds approximately 369,640 BTC, valued at an impressive $23.02 billion. In comparison, the investment giant Ethereum’s holdings amount to 414,168 ETH, with a value of around $1.01 billion, highlighting a stark difference in the allocation between the two leading cryptocurrencies. Numerous analysts in the crypto market are expressing optimism about the highly anticipated altcoin season. A popular Bitcoin and crypto analyst identified as ‘Moustache’ on X has disclosed that the altcoins season index has been forming a particularly bullish pattern for the past 3.5 years, suggesting that altcoins could be on the verge of a significant price increase. He disclosed that this technical analysis pattern is known as the “Inverse Head and Shoulder,” which often indicates a potential shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. The analyst is optimistic that the present market downturn will soon be replaced by strong growth in the altcoin market, anticipating an extended period of price gains.

Title: The New Gods Among Us...

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/12/2024 8:50:58 AM PDT by Starman417 In ancient Egypt pharaohs were considered gods. They believed that when a pharaoh died, he would continue to lead them from the beyond, which partially explains why they had such ornate tombs. At roughly the same time, Japanese emperors were similarly thought to be gods, a practice that continued until 1945, when, after the war the emperor was required to explain to his people that he, in fact, was not a god. In the Roman Empire, while emperors were not considered gods while living, most were deified upon death. While living however they were thought to have authority that had been divinely endowed. Later, through much of European history, monarchs were often thought to be divinely inspired. There existed a concept called the Divine Right of Kings which suggested that kings were anointed by God and ruled by his grace. As such, they did not have to answer to anyone on this earthly plain, whether the Pope, parliament, nobles or anyone else. Of course ruling via God’s grace didn’t always protect kings from earthly dangers – in the form of assassinations or wars between two simultaneously divinely inspired enemies or your run of the mill usurper – but it was a great gig, if you could keep it. As regal and majestic as all of this sounds, in reality, divine rule was nothing more than a tool to help establish legitimacy and maintain power for the ruling elites. Who could be a more powerful ally in demonstrating that an individual or a group should have power than God? Using armies and weapons to keep subjects from questioning authority or revolting could be expensive. It was cheaper to do so through or with the assistance of religious beliefs. If one could convince a man that his king was acting in the stead of God, the threshold of abuse he would accept before revolting would be much higher than if the king were just a man. While the United States has never had a king – divine or otherwise as George Washington quashed that when offered the crown and turned it down – our Declaration of Independence, the document that established our nation, looks to God for inspiration. That doesn’t mean we aren’t ruled by gods, however. I’ve always wondered why some of America’s richest people, particularly tech and finance types lean to the left. How could someone who has benefited so extraordinarily from the American system support ideas that are so anathema to its very existence? The things they support generally include bigger government, higher taxes, limitations on freedoms of speech and the right to bear arms among others. The first is bigger government. Many corporations see increasing regulations as a means to limit competition. By supporting minimum wage hikes or increased reporting regulations or mandates, large companies – many of whom are controlled or owned by billionaires – can and do use the government to impose costs that cripple small competitors while they themselves have the resources to easily comply. Coincidentally, concurrently, the elites, particularly those in tech and on Wall Street, have little connection to the real world most Americans inhabit. From farms to restaurants to retail stores to truck drivers, the elites, in their remote offices and relatively low regulatory environments aren’t much impacted when OSHA or the DOT or EPA issue new regulations that handicap small business owners. While Wall Street may be heavily regulated as it relates to advertising and fiduciary responsibilities, the actual buying and selling is relatively unregulated when compared to the red tape blue collar industries face. When it comes to higher taxes, this is usually a red herring for America’s barons. Many of America’s wealthiest leftists call for higher income taxes, one most of them don’t actually pay. Most billionaires don’t pay themselves much of a taxable salary and they earn most of their incomes from stock sales or dividends, which are typically taxed at a lower rate. Regardless, even if capital gains taxes were increased, they find opaque tax avoidance schemes that often reduce their taxes to zero or less, options that are rarely available to the average millionaire, nevermind the average Joe. Free speech is another element of American culture that elites seem to have little appreciation for. Leftists of all income ranges favor curtailing conservative speech, with violence a common tactic on college campuses. The elites don’t dirty their hands with violence, of course, rather seeking to act through their control over social and traditional media, or via DEI coercion tactics of firms like BlackRock and Citadel.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Starman417 Part of the leadin is inaccurate; the “Divine Right of Kings” bit in particular involved kings being anointed by the local Christian clergy and therefore binding themselves to Christian norms to a greater or lesser degree (except for people like Henry...) Anyway this was a great improvement over king as simply the guy who personally or with his buddies would lop your head off if you didn’t obey him. The modern neo-feudalism is more of the Egyptian or Chinese style where the emperor is the religion and the state in his own person. One of the many reasons leftists degrade education is that if people actually learned history, they might notice that leftists love to mock Christianity when rulers use religion as a tool of social control at the same time seeking to have similar social control themselves in the name of dirt or a disguised version of a deadly sin (e.g. “equity” is just envy with a sales job). 6 posted on 10/12/2024 9:57:19 AM PDT by No.6 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Gnome1949 Agree 100% 7 posted on 10/12/2024 11:26:45 AM PDT by vpintheak (Sometimes you’re the windshield, sometimes you’re the bug. ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: vpintheak bill g is no god.. a goddarn pervert ignoranest pineapple filled up with himself 8 posted on 10/12/2024 12:10:52 PM PDT by skinny old man (Still lurking and posting after all these years(27 yrs ?)(more ?)(seems like more...))

In the Roman Empire, while emperors were not considered gods while living, most were deified upon death. While living however they were thought to have authority that had been divinely endowed. Later, through much of European history, monarchs were often thought to be divinely inspired. There existed a concept called the Divine Right of Kings which suggested that kings were anointed by God and ruled by his grace. As such, they did not have to answer to anyone on this earthly plain, whether the Pope, parliament, nobles or anyone else. Of course ruling via God’s grace didn’t always protect kings from earthly dangers – in the form of assassinations or wars between two simultaneously divinely inspired enemies or your run of the mill usurper – but it was a great gig, if you could keep it. As regal and majestic as all of this sounds, in reality, divine rule was nothing more than a tool to help establish legitimacy and maintain power for the ruling elites. Who could be a more powerful ally in demonstrating that an individual or a group should have power than God? Using armies and weapons to keep subjects from questioning authority or revolting could be expensive. It was cheaper to do so through or with the assistance of religious beliefs. If one could convince a man that his king was acting in the stead of God, the threshold of abuse he would accept before revolting would be much higher than if the king were just a man. While the United States has never had a king – divine or otherwise as George Washington quashed that when offered the crown and turned it down – our Declaration of Independence, the document that established our nation, looks to God for inspiration. That doesn’t mean we aren’t ruled by gods, however. I’ve always wondered why some of America’s richest people, particularly tech and finance types lean to the left. How could someone who has benefited so extraordinarily from the American system support ideas that are so anathema to its very existence? The things they support generally include bigger government, higher taxes, limitations on freedoms of speech and the right to bear arms among others. The first is bigger government. Many corporations see increasing regulations as a means to limit competition. By supporting minimum wage hikes or increased reporting regulations or mandates, large companies – many of whom are controlled or owned by billionaires – can and do use the government to impose costs that cripple small competitors while they themselves have the resources to easily comply. Coincidentally, concurrently, the elites, particularly those in tech and on Wall Street, have little connection to the real world most Americans inhabit. From farms to restaurants to retail stores to truck drivers, the elites, in their remote offices and relatively low regulatory environments aren’t much impacted when OSHA or the DOT or EPA issue new regulations that handicap small business owners. While Wall Street may be heavily regulated as it relates to advertising and fiduciary responsibilities, the actual buying and selling is relatively unregulated when compared to the red tape blue collar industries face. When it comes to higher taxes, this is usually a red herring for America’s barons. Many of America’s wealthiest leftists call for higher income taxes, one most of them don’t actually pay. Most billionaires don’t pay themselves much of a taxable salary and they earn most of their incomes from stock sales or dividends, which are typically taxed at a lower rate. Regardless, even if capital gains taxes were increased, they find opaque tax avoidance schemes that often reduce their taxes to zero or less, options that are rarely available to the average millionaire, nevermind the average Joe. Free speech is another element of American culture that elites seem to have little appreciation for. Leftists of all income ranges favor curtailing conservative speech, with violence a common tactic on college campuses. The elites don’t dirty their hands with violence, of course, rather seeking to act through their control over social and traditional media, or via DEI coercion tactics of firms like BlackRock and Citadel.

I’ve always wondered why some of America’s richest people, particularly tech and finance types lean to the left. How could someone who has benefited so extraordinarily from the American system support ideas that are so anathema to its very existence? The things they support generally include bigger government, higher taxes, limitations on freedoms of speech and the right to bear arms among others. The first is bigger government. Many corporations see increasing regulations as a means to limit competition. By supporting minimum wage hikes or increased reporting regulations or mandates, large companies – many of whom are controlled or owned by billionaires – can and do use the government to impose costs that cripple small competitors while they themselves have the resources to easily comply. Coincidentally, concurrently, the elites, particularly those in tech and on Wall Street, have little connection to the real world most Americans inhabit. From farms to restaurants to retail stores to truck drivers, the elites, in their remote offices and relatively low regulatory environments aren’t much impacted when OSHA or the DOT or EPA issue new regulations that handicap small business owners. While Wall Street may be heavily regulated as it relates to advertising and fiduciary responsibilities, the actual buying and selling is relatively unregulated when compared to the red tape blue collar industries face. When it comes to higher taxes, this is usually a red herring for America’s barons. Many of America’s wealthiest leftists call for higher income taxes, one most of them don’t actually pay. Most billionaires don’t pay themselves much of a taxable salary and they earn most of their incomes from stock sales or dividends, which are typically taxed at a lower rate. Regardless, even if capital gains taxes were increased, they find opaque tax avoidance schemes that often reduce their taxes to zero or less, options that are rarely available to the average millionaire, nevermind the average Joe. Free speech is another element of American culture that elites seem to have little appreciation for. Leftists of all income ranges favor curtailing conservative speech, with violence a common tactic on college campuses. The elites don’t dirty their hands with violence, of course, rather seeking to act through their control over social and traditional media, or via DEI coercion tactics of firms like BlackRock and Citadel.

We recently published a list of 8 Stocks Under $20 To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) stands against other under $20 stocks to invest in now. There has been a lot of discussion happening lately regarding the economy and the markets. While the economy was doing great with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates and analysts expecting the markets to continue the bullish outlook, the recent geopolitical circumstances have again created doubt among investors. We recently covered an article about 10 Stocks Under $10 With High Potential, where we talked about how the market is expected to perform if the geopolitical situation escalates. Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, mentioned that he would be buying the dip if the market goes there and also presented his bullish thesis regarding how the market tends to perform well after such tensions. Here’s an excerpt from the article: “Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, appeared on CNBC to discuss what the stock market looks like in the current geopolitically tense environment. Lee has been bullish on small caps for a long time however, he has also remained cautious regarding some bumps in the start before the market for small caps starts to rise. He maintained a bullish stance, projecting a year-end target of 6,000 for the S&P 500, despite acknowledging potential short-term volatility due to upcoming events like the election and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. He emphasized that current market conditions are tricky, with headline risks stemming from a potential port strike that could impact the economy. Lee suggested that if a significant dip occurs, it would be a good opportunity to buy, as he believes the long-term outlook remains positive despite temporary setbacks. Talking about how the market has performed during wars in the past. Lee noted that historically, market reactions to geopolitical conflicts have often been more positive than anticipated. He cited past conflicts where buying during initial downturns proved beneficial, except for the recent Russia-Ukraine war which went otherwise due to concurrent Federal Reserve tightening.” Building upon how the market is progressing, Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, says that the current market is exactly what a soft landing looks like. Adam recently appeared in an interview on CNBC to talk about how the lower interest rates will benefit the small caps in particular the Russell 2000. He believes that the bull market will continue while the economy inches towards a soft landing. When it comes to small-cap stocks they get around 56% of their financing from the short end of the curve. The short end of the curve refers to the short-term interest rate on the yield curve, which typically represents the yields on bonds with shorter maturities, such as 2-year or 5-year Treasury notes. Whereas the large-cap companies get only 26% financing from these short ends of the curve. Therefore, Adam believes that as the Fed continue to lower interest rates it will help small caps meet financing needs. He further pointed out that it is expected that the Fed will cut twice this year and another four times the next year. Another reason why he likes small caps is because the economy going towards a soft landing. Adam emphasized that we have already seen that the rate cuts helped small caps outperform the large caps. Historically speaking whenever the economy has a soft landing it typically helps the small caps greater than the rest of the market. Moreover, while mentioning his favorite sectors, Adam likes technology, healthcare, and industrials in both the small caps and large caps categories. While reasoning his interests in these sectors, he mentioned earnings in these sectors to be one of the prominent likable factors. Technology has been the only sector in the large caps category that has seen upward revisions. Moreover, the cash flow that these sectors are generating is being utilized in buybacks, paying dividends, and future growth expansions. Our Methodology To curate the list of 8 stocks under $20 to invest in now, we used the Finviz stock screener and Insider Monkey’s database for Institutional Investors. Using the screener we shortlisted stocks trading under the price tag of $20 (recorded on October 4th). Once we had the list of stocks under $20, we ranked them according to the number of hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024. The list is ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Share Price: $10.45 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47 Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is a leading automaker based in the United States. It is one of the world’s largest automakers and is known for its brands including but not limited to Ford, Mustang, and Lincoln. It manufactures and sells trucks, SUVs, cars, luxury vehicles, and EVs throughout 125 countries. There are many points that investors can argue about while talking about the company, including its massive losses in the electric vehicle department or the challenges it is facing in China. However, one of the things that the investors might be missing about Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is its Ford Pro segment, which deals with commercial customers including businesses and government agencies providing vehicles and services tailored to their needs. If we look at the first half of 2024, Ford Pro generated $5.6 billion in EBIT which was ahead of the regular company business. Moreover, while the overall revenue of the company grew 6% year-over-year, the Ford Pro grew 21% in the first half. The business in this segment also led to an increase of 35% in its software business. Gaining confidence from the growing business segment, management has raised its full-year EBIT mark of $9 billion to $10 billion from $8 billion to $9 billion for its Ford Pro business. The stock was held by 47 hedge funds in Q2 2024, making it one of the best stocks under $20 to invest in now. Overall, F ranks 5th on our list of 8 Stocks Under $20 To Invest In Now. While we acknowledge the potential of F to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: NVIDIA “Blackwell” DGX B200 Listed, Prices Start At A Half A Million Dollars For The Top of The Line AI Hardware

NVIDIA's DGX B200 "Blackwell" AI server has been listed online by server solution provider Broadberry, with a rather astonishing price tag. Team Green's next-gen Blackwell AI architecture has seen the spotlight from the industry, mainly due to how the platform is said to feature performance that the markets have never witnessed in the past. Not only NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang has immensely praised Blackwell, but its rapid adoption from mainstream tech giants, such as Microsoft and Meta, shows that NVIDIA's new AI product portfolio is ready to disrupt the markets. Interestingly, Broadberry has listed a Blackwell DGX B200 AI system, starting at around half a million dollars, which is quite surprising. NVIDIA intends to sell multiple Blackwell AI systems, but the product targeted for the wider segment of the market is the DGX B200. Each DGX B200 uses eight B200 GPUs to deliver up to 1.4 TB of GPU memory with an HBM3E memory bandwidth of up to 64 TB/s. Based on information from NVIDIA, the DGX B200 can offer up to 72 petaFLOPS of training performance and 144 petaFLOPS of inference performance, which is a huge upgrade compared to its Hopper generation counterpart. Following are the full specs of what you get with the system: The listing at Broadberry has put a price tag of $515,410.43 on the Blackwell DGX B200 AI system, with configuration options as well, mainly dealing with after-sale services. This is the first instance where we have seen NVIDIA's Blackwell AI product surface over the internet in the form of a retail listing, and while we are currently unaware of the supply situation, it is said that Blackwell will be initially confined, with a larger portion of shipments slated for the first quarter of next year. Just recently, NVIDIA delivered their first batch of the DGX B200 AI system to OpenAI, showing the exclusive relations both firms have, so it won't be wrong to say that the first batch of DGX B200 systems is already out in the markets, although we still are unclear about Broadberry's inventory, or maybe at the time this post goes live, the stock runs out. Regardless of it, NVIDIA's Blackwell will usher in a new era of "AI gold rush", ultimately leading the next-gen architecture as Team Green's most successful product.

Title: How do you solve a problem like MariaDB? Cozy up to the community, says new CEO | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The new CEO of MariaDB (Plc) says he wants closer-knit collaboration with the foundation behind the eponymous open source database project. He cites the corporation’s newfound stability from its recent acquisition by a private equity firm as to why it should now be able to get on a firmer footing. It has been a turbulent two years for MariaDB, with its ill-fated public listing via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2022 sending the company into a nosedive it never quite recovered from. Less than two years later, the Redwood City-based company was taken private by K1 Investment Management in a $37 million fire sale that was significantly below its opening day market cap of $368 million — which in turn was way below its peak private valuation of $672 million. Last month’s transaction means that MariaDB’s shares are no longer trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), though the three-month de-registration process means that the company is still technically public through early December. However, with a new CEO already in place in the form of ex-Micro Focus executive Rohit De Souza (pictured above), MariaDB is already preparing for life as a private company once more — and this will involve getting cozier with the foundation that bears the same name. “The [MariaDB’s] Foundation’s reason for existing in times past was there was a lot of uncertainty about MariaDB’s future,” De Souza told TechCrunch in an interview. “Today, with the backing of K1, there isn’t that uncertainty anymore.” The initial MariaDB project launched in 2009 as a response to MySQL falling under certain corporate ownership. MySQL is the popular open source relational database management system created by Michael “Monty” Widenius, David Axmark, and Allan Larsson back in the mid-’90s, who sold the commercial company behind the project to Sun Microsystems for $1 billion in 2008. A year later, Oracle announced it was acquiring Sun Microsystems for more than $7 billion, spurring Widenius to create MariaDB as a community-developed “fork” of MySQL. In the wake of the deal, Widenius formed a couple of organizations, one called SkySQL (focused on MySQL services) and one called Monty Program (for MariaDB), which eventually merged and rebranded as MariaDB Corporation before going on to raise $230 million in funding to sell services around the MariaDB project. In tandem, the MariaDB Foundation (established in 2012) has been safeguarding the “interests of MariaDB users and developers” as an independent not-for-profit. Today, MariaDB is the 15th most popular database, according to DB-Engines Ranking, though that figure jumps to ninth for relational databases, and fourth for open source relational databases. There have been tensions between the two MariaDB bodies through the years, particularly around the corporate entity’s focus on building out proprietary products and tools — which MariaDB Foundation CEO Kaj Arnö suggested has been to the detriment of the open source project. But after MariaDB appointed a new CEO and executive team last May, relations thawed, Arnö noting at the time that the Plc and the Foundation were “rebooting their entire relationship” with shared goals centered around cooperation and openness. Twelve months on, and MariaDB has yet another new CEO. But an arguably more important factor is that it now has the backing of a major private equity firm, and it no longer has to pander to the pressures of the public markets. This could give MariaDB a little more freedom to get back to basics, in cahoots with the Foundation. “There’s like a billion downloads [MariaDB database] and a big, vibrant community. Our intent is to grow that community, and have the Foundation be the engine that helps that community grow,” De Souza said. “We’ve got fairly deep pockets [now] — that doesn’t mean that we’re going to go out and spend like sailors tomorrow, but we can run a decent business together. A closer involvement with the Foundation will help feed things that the community really needs into product development — it will help us understand the community, and we could also use the community more to test new ideas.” On the Foundation side, Arnö says that there are now “shared strategy sessions” taking place to find ways they can support each other’s efforts. He also echoed De Souza’s sentiments, adding that he doesn’t want to dwell too much on historical tensions. “The past is behind us — I want to focus on the future, and how we can all work together on a shared goal, and not elaborate on the past,” Arnö told TechCrunch. “I am now more optimistic about the relationship between the Foundation and MariaDB the Company than I have ever been since taking the CEO position in 2019.” Historically, the vast majority of the code for the core MariaDB Server product was provided by the MariaDB corporation, a reliance that led the Foundation to seek alternative sources. For example, last year it signed up Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its first “diamond” sponsor, which is committing €500,000 ($550,000) per year — more than any other sponsor. On top of that, the MariaDB Foundation is in the midst of bringing vector search (a major component of the AI revolution) to its main database, with Amazon one of the core contributors alongside the MariaDB corporation. While the “relationship reboot” between the two MariaDBs is surely positive for those in the community, the Foundation is continuing to lean into its relationship with Amazon, which is now one of the single biggest code-contributing corporations outside of MariaDB Plc. “AWS has recently stepped up to start contributing code for MariaDB Server,” Arnö said. “I find this to be exciting for a number of reasons, but in particular, of all the open source relational databases out there, AWS has specifically chosen to invest in MariaDB Server. MariaDB as part of AWS service offerings gives us great exposure to a large AWS user base, which feeds the overall community and collaboration we are trying to drive.” Today, MariaDB Plc claims around 200 employees, 40% of whom reside in North America, while nearly half are located in Europe. That’s somewhat fewer than what it had at the start of last year, with the company going through two rounds of layoffs amounting to more than 100 staff — one-third of the workforce. In addition, part of this restructuring has entailed ditching key products “not related to the core MariaDB Enterprise Server business,” including its SkySQL cloud database service. But despite all the cutbacks of the past 18 months, De Souza reckons that they’ll be more likely to see net growth in the coming months. “There are always going to be places that we’ve over-invested in or under-invested in. There’s always going to be some fine-tuning, but I expect MariaDB to grow — I do expect to infuse new talent,” De Souza said. “I do expect to augment the existing talent. There’ll be some areas where we have to change things. Obviously, it hasn’t worked in the past for a reason.” MariaDB grew off the back of more than $200 million in venture capital, and its failure in the public markets can be attributed to many things: the macroeconomic situation at the time, lukewarm financial performances, and the fact that it went public via the dubious SPAC route before it was close to profitable. Life as a private company, backed by private equity, couldn’t be more different — private equity is all about investing in underperforming businesses that have the potential to be stabilized and grow, and this usually starts with bringing in seasoned management. De Souza has a strong record in the enterprise realm, having previously worked at Intel, SAP, Oracle, Hewlett Packard, and most recently Micro Focus, where he was a senior executive through its $6 billion acquisition by OpenText. He was also previously CEO and president of data management company Actian, which was acquired by HCL and private equity firm Sumeru Equity Partners in 2018. And it’s this combination of experience and skills that De Souza sees as being one of the biggest assets that he brings to MariaDB. “It’s everything from helping navigate customers, helping drive how products are developed, how you actually build a sales team,” De Souza said. “Every one of those is required to build an enterprise software company. But really, it’s all about people: understanding the people that you need inside the company, and how you stabilize and build those teams.” While De Souza was hesitant to be drawn on the SPAC IPO debacle that his company endured before he joined, he did say that he was ultimately brought in to bring some “enterprise rigor” to the mix, now that it’s away from the pressures of being a public company. “You’ve got to run a company efficiently, and at a profit — it doesn’t take a genius to run a company at a loss,” De Souza said. “That’s part of why I’m here, it’s to bring some enterprise rigor to the business — how we develop products, what we invest in, how we create some consistency and focus around the communities.” Topics Director Morgan Neville is steering clear of generative AI after ‘Roadrunner’ backlash Apple might release a $2,000 Vision headset next year The promise and perils of synthetic data Data center tech is exploding but adoption won’t be easy for startups In latest move against WP Engine, WordPress takes control of ACF plugin The most interesting unicorns to come out of Japan The WordPress vs. WP Engine drama, explained Senior Reporter © 2024 Yahoo.

(Bloomberg) -- Earnings season is here, and the US stock market’s furious $9 trillion 2024 rally is facing perhaps its biggest test of the year.

In mid-June, projections were for an 8.4% rise, and in the second quarter growth soared to 14%. Despite the shrunken expectations, the S&P 500 hit another record high on Friday and is up 22% in 2024, its best start to a year since 1997. Investors who keep bidding up stock prices may be onto something, because there appears to be room for an upside earnings surprise if those reduced forecasts turn out to be overly gloomy. It happened in the first quarter, when expectations were for 3.8% growth and it turned out to be 7.9%. “Analysts lowered EPS estimates more than is typical heading into reporting, which could lead to an elevated beat rate and better equity performance across the quarter,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird. Earnings season unofficially kicked off on Friday, led by financial bellwethers JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and BlackRock Inc. More key companies will deliver results next week, including Citigroup Inc., Netflix Inc. and JB Hunt Transport Services Inc. Here’s a look at five key themes to watch as the results roll in: AI Slows Down The bulk of the growth in S&P 500 earnings continues to come from the big-technology companies that are seen as major beneficiaries from the development of artificial intelligence. The so-called Magnificent Seven firms — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. — are expected to post an 18% rise in profits in the third quarter. Their issue is the rate of increase is slowing, down from more than 30% in 2023, according to BI. For the rest of the S&P 500, profits are expected to climb 1.8% in the July-September period, which would be their second straight quarterly increase, albeit barely, BI data show. They posted 9.1% growth in the second quarter. That said, profits for the S&P’s “other 493” firms are projected to accelerate substantially from here, with double-digit gains anticipated in the first quarter of 2025, according to data compiled by BI. ‘Stock Picker’s Paradise’ Investors should expect some major swings in individual stocks that don’t show up in the broader index. The options market is pricing in the biggest average post-results implied move at the single-stock level since 2021, when Bank of America Corp. started collecting the data. But implied volatility at the index level is relatively muted, a sign that this earnings season could be a “stock picker’s paradise,” the firm’s strategists including Ohsung Kwon wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. Three of the 11 S&P 500 sectors — technology, communication services and health care — are expected to post profit expansions of more than 10%. The energy group, on the other hand, is expected to report a decline of more than 20%. The sector saw the biggest decline in profit estimates among 11 industry groups as crude prices plunged last quarter, according to BI chief equity strategist Gina Martin Adams. All About Margins Wall Street pros will be closely watching profit margins, which is a key measure of how effective companies have been at squeezing earnings out of their sales. Net-income margins are expected to slip to about 12.9%, less than the 13.1% reported in the second quarter but slightly higher than 12.8% in the third quarter of 2023, data compiled by BI show. The mild dip reflects the challenges some firms face in passing on input costs to costumers as wage pressures remain sticky in several low-productivity industries that are difficult to automate. Profit margins are going to be the weakest for energy and real estate stocks, BI data show. But looking more broadly, they’re expected to rebound in the coming quarters. Choppy European Markets In Europe, this earnings season could mark a turning point for the Stoxx 600 Index, which is hovering near record highs. Analysts cut profit estimates going into the third quarter, with a Citigroup index showing downgrades outnumbering upgrades since mid-June. Meanwhile, regional economies are seeing anemic growth, and manufacturing powerhouse Germany has forecast a contraction for a second year. While the reduced earnings estimates lower the bar for companies to beat expectations, forecasts for 2025 remain high and any guidance on weakening consumer demand would force them to come down, which would spill over into stock prices. A slew of high-profile companies, including Swedish clothing retailer Hennes & Mauritz AB and Volkswagen AG, have issued profit warnings in recent weeks. And a stunted recovery in China is likely to weigh on earnings at luxury goods makers such as LVMH. Election Focus With the US presidential election only weeks away, investors will be listening for mentions of economic and trade policy risks and other political issues from corporate executives. About 110 companies mentioned the word “election“ in their second-quarter earnings calls, up 62% from four years ago, BofA data show. History suggests that corporate investment activity accelerates after US presidential elections, which may be a catalyst for companies to unleash capital in the quarters ahead, particularly given lower interest rates, according to BofA’s Kwon. But it also may be delaying some expansion plans and other expenditures. “So much of the capital investment these days is AI related, and the election is not likely to curb that much, if at all,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. “However, now that we’re so close to the election, some of the more traditional capital commitments are likely to be delayed due to the political uncertainty.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Jamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary: The Idea That Never Fades Inside the Companies That Set Sports Gambling Odds Lina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes) The Robotaxi Verdict Is In—And Wall Street Is Taking the Train Why Is It So Hard for Clothing Resale Platforms to Make Money? ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: ETF Investors Shrug Off Market Uncertainties, Bullish on Mag 7, Schwab Survey Finds

Market volatility, high interest rates, inflation and the upcoming presidential election haven't affected the investment strategies of most exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors. Most ETF investors surveyed by Charles Schwab (SCHW) Asset Management said that these economic and political events did not change the way they invest in ETFs. In fact, roughly a third of the investors put more money into ETFs based on their reading of stock market volatility, high interest rates and persistent inflation, according to the survey results released this week. ETFs have a track record across market cycles, said David Botset, Managing Director, Head of Innovation and Stewardship at Schwab Asset Management, adding that "investors are confident in their investments even when the outlook is uncertain.” ETF investors have grown more bullish on certain types of stocks and sectors since last year: 69% are bullish on technology and 60% on growth stocks. Additionally, 55% of investors are optimistic about the the Magnificent 7, a group of seven mega-cap technology companies including Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA). The Mag 7 stocks have a big influence on the stock markets and have driven much of the S&P 500's returns over the past year. But when they falter, as they did in July this year, they tend to drag the broader stock market down with them. The survey also showed how investment preferences vary across generations. For instance, 62% of millennials (or those born between 1981 and 1996), said they plan to invest in cryptocurrency ETFs over the next year versus 15% of Boomers (or those born between 1946 and 1964). A quarter of millennials said they plan to invest in alternatives ETFs, compared with just 11% of boomers. At the same time, 44% of millennials also want to increase their exposure to lower-risk fixed income ETFs. In contrast, fewer GenX (34%) and Boomer (26%) investors plan to do likewise. This is in line with other recent studies that point to recent stock market volatility making millennials more risk-averse compared to some older generations.

Iyengar Comments READ LATER Mutual fund houses are rushing to load their armoury with passive funds before the pure play passive fund focused Jio Financial-Blackrock combine launch its business soon. In last nine months, 87 passive schemes were launched against 51 in the whole of last year. Mop-up through passive funds have more than doubled to ₹7,472 crore in September quarter against ₹3,415 crore in the previous two quarters (March and June) put together, according to AMFI data. The number of issuance was also substantially higher at 39 in September quarter against 18 NFOs in June quarter and 30 in March quarter. Capital market regulator SEBI gave in-principal approval to the new player launch mutual fund business subject to fulfilment of certain conditions and also notified MF Lite regulations. After promising to deliver alpha in actively managed funds, MFs are wooing investors with innovative smart beta passive funds instead of index tracking plain vanilla funds. Passive funds launched by large fund houses such as HDFC MF, Nippon MF, Birla MF and Tata MF have become an instant hit with investors. The fund houses either pick up top 10 or 30 stocks of a popular index to deliver smart beta. Tata MF has launched one of its kind Tata Nifty Capital Markets Index Funds. The newly introduced Nifty Capital Market index will consist of 20 companies from Nifty 500 index. Nippon Life India Asset Management recently launched Nifty 500 Equal Weight Index Fund and Nifty 500 Momentum 50 Index Fund. Tata MF launched a passive tourism fund, while DSP MF came out with a fund that invests only in top-10 companies of Nifty index. Investing in concentrated index funds will carry higher risk though it can deliver better return in a bull market. Anand Vardarajan, Chief Business Officer, Tata Asset Management said the country is witnessing a shift particularly among new generation who are not going to yesteryear savings vehicles but considering financial markets for investment. Investors should not be perturbed by the recent fall in market when they are investing for next five years as it is very natural for markets to move up or come down a bit, he added. Anil Ghelani, CFA, Head of Passive Investments, DSP MF said, investor interest is steadily increasing and financial advisors are also finding it useful to include passive funds in their recommendations. “Passive fund carries the risk of the underlying index it aims to track and the risks associated with broader equity markets,” he said.

Title: Scotiabank Initiates Outperform Rating for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Predicts Growth Driven by AI Innovations

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices. As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 308 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Scotiabank analyst Nat Schindler recently initiated coverage of the stock with an Outperform rating and $245 price target. The advisory has a high level of confidence that consumers will use Amazon's services more in the future. It is also positive on the company's ability to monetize its artificial intelligence investments. The investment firm expects corporate uses, streamlining customer interactions, speeding code development, storing and contextualizing unstructured data, and other business efficiencies to be the most substantial near- to medium-term opportunities. Overall AMZN ranks 1st among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: How Interest Rates Will Impact This 7%+ Closed-End Fund

Small Cap write on sticky notes isolated on Office Desk. Stock market concept Normally when interest rates fall, we closed-end fund (CEF) investors are tempted to pick up a fund like the 7.3%-paying Royce Small-Cap Trust (RVT). It seems like a particularly savvy move today, with this small cap–focused CEF trading at a 10.3% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Cheap! But is that really a good value, or could RVT get cheaper still? Let’s take a look, starting with small caps generally. Like large caps, they benefit as lower rates boost consumer spending. But there are two other factors that make falling-rate periods particularly advantageous for smaller firms: With that in mind—plus the fact that small caps tend to be more domestic-focused, helping shield them from global instability—you’d think investors would’ve bid them to the moon this year, right? Well, not so much. Small Caps Lag So far, traders aren’t calling for a small-cap rebound, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), in purple above, trailing the benchmark S&P 500 ETF (in orange). (IWM invests in all 2000 small caps that make up the primary US small-cap index, the Russell 2000.) We normally love a contrarian setup like this at my CEF Insider service, but this time I think the herd has a point. It’s true that lower rates encourage people to spend more. But remember too that rates tend to be cut during a recession. And in a recession, Americans are already cutting spending. So lower rates do tend to push up consumer spending in those times—albeit from an already-low base. However, when Americans are already spending a lot, as they are today, cutting rates won’t necessarily do much. Spending Ticks Higher As you can see above, the big jump in interest rates we’ve seen, from near nothing to 5.5% in just 18 months, didn’t slow consumer-spending growth. So it doesn’t make sense that consumer spending will grow with lower rates; that’s usually the case, but probably won’t be this time. What about the buying-on-margin story? That idea is a bit broken, too. Margin Loans, Interest Rates As you can see, the lower cost of borrowing on margin (related to the federal funds rate, in red above) made for a huge amount of margin borrowing (the blue line) during the pandemic. But margin balances went back to their normal trend in 2022, when rates rose. This, by the way, is the main reason why stocks tanked that year. In other words, the market has already gotten to a “normal” level of margin borrowing. Rates falling from 5% to 3%, where the Fed has said it wants them to settle, isn’t going to cause that speculative buying of small-cap stocks like we saw shortly after the pandemic—or for that matter, in the 2010s, when rates were also low. That also means this chart is unlikely to repeat itself. IWM Tracks SPY In the low-rate 2010s, small caps started from being oversold during the Great Recession. But even with the low starting point, they merely tracked the S&P 500. In other words, investing in small caps based on the idea that others will borrow to invest in them wasn’t a great move when rates were at 0.25%, let alone 3%. Which leads me to the final point: small caps’ investments in innovation. Technology has become a big part of the total US stock market because tech firms have provided tremendous innovation over the last decade: Companies from across the economy depend more on Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and the like more than ever. That trend has been running since the end of the dot-com bubble. The current scramble among big firms to integrate AI just exacerbates it. And that’s why the top constituents of IWM, the main small-cap index fund, are a worry. IWM Top Holdings There are good companies in here, like FTAI Aviation (FTAI), which repairs and maintains jet engines. But, as a few industry reports note (like this one and this one), the big aviation firms, like Boeing (BA) and Airbus, already use AI to improve their aircraft-maintenance services. So smaller firms like FTAI will need to invest in cutting-edge AI tech to compete. That’s squeezes smaller companies’ profits more than those of larger firms. But the main winners are those that provide the AI infrastructure both the FTAIs and Boeings need—companies like Amazon.com (AMZN) and NVIDIA (NVDA). This brings us back to RVT. While its yield sounds great, at 7.3%, it’s actually low for CEFs, which yield 8.2% on average. And while we love being contrarians at CEF Insider, in this case we can’t be, since RVT’s past performance shows that it should actually be cheaper. Let me explain. RVT Total Returns Price RVT’s market price (in purple above) has been beating IWM by a healthy margin over the last decade. But if we compare IWM to RVT’s total NAV return, which reflects the actual performance of the CEF’s managers, things look different. RVT Total Returns NAV RVT has actually been tracking the small-cap index for a long time, and if its discount falls to 15% or lower, that’d be a great entry point. But at a 10.3% discount, given its 10-year average discount of 11.1%, RVT is still not a great deal for us. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Miriam Lord’s week: ‘More haste, less speed’ makes for an apt slogan as election fever symptoms erupt

Evidence pointing to a late November election continues to pile up, despite the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste’s increasingly wan insistence that it will be happening next year. If the fervent wishes of all those in Leinster House were enough to influence a decision, it would be called tomorrow. RTÉ’s Fiachra Ó Cionnaith’s tweeted a telltale photo this week of pallets of Fianna Fáil election posters shrink-wrapped with hundreds of smiling Micheál Martins and a slogan on the front plaintively whispering “Moving Forward Together” and “With Whoever Will Have Us” on the reverse. And as the parties attempt to stuff as much money into the coffers as possible before the election is called, Fine Gael supporters are noting with interest that the date of its Superdraw money-raising lottery has been brought forward from December 5th. There is major deck-clearing going on in Government Buildings. Sinn Féin is currently banjaxed. Jennifer Bray reports elsewhere on its latest catastrophe where they’re tearing the party to shreds in Kildare. Oh, and here’s what some see as the clincher. The Late Late Toy Show airs this year on December 6th, with “insiders” swearing that programme planners in Montrose moved it back from its traditional slot at the end of November to avoid a possible clash with general election coverage. And all those Fine Gael posters and billboards appearing like a rash on gable walls and bus shelters throughout the land. Like the billboard promising “A new energy for Kildare South” with candidates Joe Neville, Evie Sammon and Bernard Durkan alongside high-wattage Simon Harris beaming down on the masses. FG’s runners in Kildare South must have been shocked to see it. The aforementioned candidates are actually standing in Kildare North. The sense of indecent haste continues with Cllr John Paul O’Shea, the party’s candidate in Cork North West, ending up on the side of a bus shelter in Listowel, birthplace of Billy O’Shea, Fine Gael’s actual candidate in Kerry. And hats off to Minister for Higher Education Patrick O’Donovan, spectacularly ignoring his Government’s line that the election will be next year with huge billboards in Limerick. Featuring one huge photo of Patrick’s smiley phizog, it bears a simple message, writ large: “Patrick O’Donovan TD. Your Cabinet Minister for Limerick.” Nah. It’ll be in February. With TDs and senators all of a dither this week over claims that one of their own is a Russian secret agent, we were surprised not to hear the stentorian tones of former soldier Senator Gerard Craughwell holding forth on this critical issue of national security. Members of the Upper House have seemed far more exercised on this matter than their Dáil counterparts. Rear-Admiral Craughwell, who recently put the wind up Putin by threatening to send out a flotilla of finger-wagging Irish parliamentarians to monitor Russian naval manoeuvres in Irish waters, takes a keen interest in defence matters and his observations on the unfolding espionage crisis were much anticipated. Gerard, however, has been deeply involved in manoeuvres of a different kind. He is busy ensuring his re-election to the Seanad. A member of the Seanad’s independent group of senators, he was first elected in 2014, unexpectedly winning a by-election on the Cultural and Education panel after Fine Gael’s shoo-in candidate became embroiled in a row over government stroke politics and withdrew from the race. Despite it being incredibly tough for an independent to win in a contest where elected local politicians control the vote, he has managed to keep his seat by keeping the councillors sweet. This year, he splashed out on over 940 lapel badges and posted one to every councillor in the country. The pins, produced by Abbey Badges in Blackrock, are attractive items and have been “well received” says Senator Craughwell. “You will note the pins are unique with the name of the council on top, the council coat of arms and ‘elected June 2024′ at the bottom,” he tells us. “They are a mark of recognition and a collector’s item.” Each pin comes with a card from Gerard congratulating them on their success. “Wear it with pride for all that you have accomplished. Keep up the good work!” He also encloses full details of his particulars in case anyone wants to take them down. The race for the next Seanad may not have officially started, but it’s already in full swing. “Be sure I will run!” parps the bullish Craughwell. Of the many tributes paid to Mary O’Rourke since her death just over a week ago, one of the more interesting ones came from Ivan Yates, who was Fine Gael spokesman on public enterprise when Mary ran the department. Speaking on his weekly podcast with Matt Cooper, Ivan was full of praise for the political acumen of his erstwhile sparring partner – but he didn’t rate her at all as a minister. He was very firmly on the side of Brian Joyce, the former chairman of CIÉ who resigned on her ministerial watch citing “interference”, among other things. After the bombshell broke, Mary was shocked, breathlessly telling Morning Ireland how she heard the news. Ivan spoke vaguely of the way “this pressure came up”, which led to Mary revealing to the nation that she was “in the bath listening to the totally unannounced, unexpected resignation of Mr Joyce”. He regaled himself with details of his heroic part in this affair – how he played a blinder on the same programme a short time later, noting that after she went on about her bath “she proceeded to completely drop the towel and put the knife into Mr Joyce in a quite outrageous way”. Then they clashed on Prime Time, where she continued “savaging” Joyce while “letting on she didn’t know anything about it [the resignation] but she absolutely garrotted him”. Mary O’Rourke may not be around now to contradict him, but Richard Moore, her media adviser at the time, offers a more detailed timeline of what happened all those ago. It’s a tale full of drama and intrigue and he has never spoken about it before. That memorable bath and resignation episode happened on a Tuesday morning in the year 2000. On the previous day, Monday, March 6th, Mary was due to appear on RTÉ's Questions and Answers. There would, doubtless, be a question on the ongoing rows between her and her CIÉ chairman over how the organisation and, in particular, the rail system was funded and run. Joyce was appointed by Fine Gael in 1995 and had been due to retire in November 2000. Relations between them were always poor and Mary had been demanding a meeting with CIÉ’s chief executive later that week to discuss the company’s performance. Sadly, in a heartbreaking turn of events, the programme was cancelled due to the unexpected death of the presenter’s son. On Tuesday morning, The Irish Times splashed with a front page exclusive by Arthur Beesley. The story, with its leaked details, was filed on Monday night. Brian Joyce had resigned because of Mary O’Rourke’s “interference”. This came as a bolt from the blue to the Department. The usual practice if the chair of a semi-state was going to resign (or write a stern rebuke) was to call the Minister’s office first to let them know to expect a very important letter. That never happened in this case, recalls Richard Moore. Instead, Joyce’s resignation letter was hand-delivered to the minister’s office in Kildare Street after 8pm on Monday evening when she would have been in RTÉ, had circumstances not intervened. It was accepted by the security/service officer on duty and the unknown individual who delivered it said nothing about alerting the Minister or the Department to its importance. It was eventually opened on Tuesday, well after its contents had been revealed by The Irish Times. And well after RTÉ led its 7am radio bulletin with a report based on Beesley’s scoop. When she heard it, a stunned Mary immediately rang her media adviser. He headed straight into the office, getting in at 7.30am to find her already at her desk. She spoke to Morning Ireland after the 8am bulletin, famously declaring where she was when she heard the shock news. Afterwards, some commentators described the sharing of this detail as a masterstroke. All anyone could remember was that she was in the bath when somebody resigned and the story quickly faded. But back to RTÉ, where the plot thickens. Had Q&A not been cancelled at the last minute, Mary would have been on the panel with Fine Gael’s Jim Mitchell. A view quickly formed in Fianna Fáil circles – one shared by Moore – that the Minister escaped an ambush that night. Inevitably, she would have been asked about her troubled relationship with CIÉ and answered it with her usual confidence, only for someone – possibly the late Mr Mitchell – to remark if she was such a great minister, how come her chairman had resigned? Cue bafflement, consternation ... carnage. There is a delicious final twist. Much later on that fateful Tuesday, the then minister of state Mary Hanafin contacted O’Rourke about a strange voice message someone had left on her mobile phone. Richard Moore says it went something like: “Hello Ivan, I think matters have worked out well; let me know what else I can do.” In those days, TDs were allocated phones with sequenced numbers. There was (and still is) a one-digit difference between the phone numbers of Ivan Yates and Mary Hanafin. Back then, she was used to people leaving messages placing bets on horses. Yates was a bookie as well as an ambitious politician. O’Rourke believed she had her “gotcha!” moment. Her team downloaded Hanafin’s recording on to cassette tapes with a view to releasing it to the media at a snap press conference. It would have been sensational, particularly as the man who thought he was ringing Ivan Yates (and who did not get on with O’Rourke) gave his first name. But in the end they decided against it. Moore, who went on to set up a successful communications consultancy, felt this would complicate the unfolding resignation commentary – which was going well for his minister, while it might be best not to remind people of Fianna Fáil’s past history with recording phone calls. It took a lot of persuading, but Mary agreed to say nothing. A hard ask for the woman concerned, but she kept her part of the bargain. Our politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

Title: We have a problem with squirrels in our garden. What can we do to keep them at bay?

Q: We have a problem with grey squirrels in our city garden. They are digging in the beds and causing damage to some of the plants. Any tips on how to keep them at bay? RL, Blackrock, Dublin A: As charming as their arboreal acrobatics might be to watch, grey squirrels can be a real problem in Irish gardens, stripping bark from broad-leaf trees, raiding birds’ nests, burrowing into lawns and digging up flower bulbs. They also feed on seeds, nuts, fruits, tender shoots and flower buds and act as a vector for diseases such as squirrel pox virus which can kill the smaller native red squirrel in a matter of weeks. They are also known to sometimes overwinter in the attics of houses where they can cause considerable damage by chewing through wires and pipework and ripping up insulation as well as contaminating water tanks. Classed as an invasive species, they were first introduced into Ireland in 1911. Thankfully the spread of their natural predator the pine marten in recent years has acted as a curb on numbers. But in urban areas where the pine marten hasn’t gained much of a foothold, grey squirrels are still common. How to best manage them? I know of one Dublin gardener who tried trapping them in a baited cage before releasing them into the wild. But this is not recommended, not least because they breed so prolifically that it would barely put a dent in their numbers but also because it could potentially threaten red squirrel populations. Bird feeders are an obvious draw, so make sure to use squirrel-proof models that prevent them from easily raiding them for food. Recently planted flower bulbs are another, for which reason seasoned gardeners often like to plant theirs under a protective layer of fine mesh chicken wire concealed beneath the surface of the soil of compost. Alternatively, they can be planted into an aquatic basket (the kind used for pond plants) covered with a layer of chicken wire and then planted into the ground. It’s also a good idea to regularly check your home for any small gaps in the eaves and/or soffit boards that could allow them entry, especially at this time of year when they are searching for a sheltered place in which to overwinter. These should be blocked up with a fine-gauge wire mesh (16 gauge, no more than 25mm size). But even with these measures, I’m afraid that they are likely to continue to be a problem.

Title: Mizuho Raises Equinix, Inc. (EQIX) Price Target to $971, Maintains Outperform Rating Amid Positive Outlook for Cab Billing Growth and xScale Demand

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices. As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of IT professionals working on a digital platform, indicating the company's agile digital services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56 Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a California-based real estate trust that operates data centers and other technology assets. Mizuho recently raised the price target on the stock to $971 from $873 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares after speaking with management. The company's cab's billing growth will improve in the second half of 2024 and when combined with strong pricing power, there is upside to monthly recurring revenue, the advisory told investors in a research note. The investment firm sees multiple levers of earnings and sales growth for Equinix. While still a small part of the business, the company suggested a very robust demand pipeline for its xScale portfolio, added Mizuho. Overall EQIX ranks 16th among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of EQIX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EQIX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Arm Holdings stock hits all the right notes for AI investors. It has a high historical revenue growth rate of 18% and analysts expect this growth to accelerate moving forward to 22% annually. These numbers are supported by strong license and royalty revenue, as well as increasing adoption of the chip architecture of the firm that competes on cost and energy efficiency. Daiwa recently upgraded the stock to Outperform from Neutral with a $130 price target, noting that following a few interesting and volatile quarters, the bad news of a possible recession was out, and tech was settling post the big recent selloff, though AI expectations were still strong. The advisory expected Arm shares to trend further upwards in the next few months. Overall ARM ranks 22nd among the AI stocks that are trending right now.

The firm claims that with the help of advanced sensor technology and AI, the system can detect weapons much faster than traditional metal detectors. The company has been testing this system in New York over the past few months, with mixed results. Overall EVLV ranks 31st among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of EVLV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EVLV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SiTime Corporation (NASDAQ:SITM) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices. As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The firm markets micro-electromechanical systems that are designed to improve performance in data centers, 5G networks, and AI-driven applications. Barclays analyst Tom O'Malley recently downgraded the stock to Underweight from Equal Weight with an unchanged price target of $90. The advisory said SiTime was one of the more expensive names in its coverage with estimates likely still too high for 2025. Barclays agreed that a recovery from the pandemic correction was underway, but struggled to see how the stock's valuation at these levels made sense. SiTime has admitted to broadening its sales pipeline to more multi-sourced opportunities, which will pressure gross margins into next year, the advisory told investors in a research note. Overall SITM ranks 32nd among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of SITM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Letters: Key workers in our capital should get first dibs on any below market-cost rentals

Gardaí are among the key workers facing soaring rents in Dublin. Photo: Getty John Coleman, CEO of the Land Development Agency will appear before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) next week to confirm the building of 17,000 new homes in the coming years. These homes will be rented at €1,000 below market rent. Wonderful and welcome news, as we all have a responsibility to look after the least well-off. Unfortunately, there was not one word about how our key workers can no longer afford to live in Dublin. Dublin is one of the few developed capital cities in the world that does not pay “weighting allowances” to retain key workers. We are educating them in the thousands to emigrate. No city can function properly without key workers, and if this problem is not addressed then Dublin and Ireland will suffer both socially and economically in the future. Many will argue that the rot has already set in and point to the scarcity of gardaí, teachers and nurses. Will any member of the PAC have the courage to ask Mr Coleman if the billions being spent on housing by the Government do anything to solve the rental crisis for key workers in Dublin? We need key workers more than they need us. Paschal Taggart, Rathgar, Dublin 6 One notes that Trinity College Dublin has renamed the Berkeley Library after the Irish poet Eavan Boland. This has come about after years of campaigning from students and staff as a way of celebrating those who use these buildings. It’s important to remember that George Berkeley – Anglo-Irish philosopher, bishop and cannabis user – was a slave owner as well as being a vocal proponent of this egregious trade. I found it incredulous that Ireland’s most celebrated philosopher was extremely flawed and fallible. Trinity College never had any buildings named after women until now. This indicates to me a college that is modernising itself in meeting with the challenges of today. It would be true to say progress is slow, but the arc of history always bends towards justice. I am delighted this renaming has occurred, as it is important that we always acknowledge the students who use these buildings. What the renaming brings up for me is that there is no tradition too sacred to question. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary This week has underscored the devastating impact of our current economic model on nature. The World Wildlife Fund’s Living Planet Report reveals a calamitous decline in wildlife populations since 1970, with ecosystems like the Amazon and coral reefs nearing collapse (‘Tipping point near as wildlife populations down 73pc in 50 years’, Irish Independent, October 10). These ecosystems are vital for our climate, but also our food and health. At the same time, the report warned of potential “social collapse” from climate change, with regions becoming uninhabitable and millions at risk. Yet there is hope. Both reports stress that reversing this damage is still possible with radical, urgent changes in our economics, politics, behaviour and assumptions. Change starts with each of us. By acting locally, uniting with others and demanding accountability from the powerful, we can spark the wider transformation needed to protect the planet. Hans Zomer, Global Action Plan As a tillage farmer reaching Irish climate change targetsyears earlier than the target set by our Government, I do have to ask how is that we have to use Irish cream from Irish cows to make Irish cream liquors, yet there is no mention where the grain has to come from to make our world-famous Irish whiskeys? The technical file covering both liquors and whiskey was drafted by our Department of Agriculture and I have to ask why is the imbalance in the two agricultural sectors – tillage and dairy – in favour of dairy? Why not protect the tillage sector in an equal fashion? In a world of climate change, where I believe I produce a near net-zero carbon footprint product, where is the support from the Government for me and my fellow tillage farmers? The Irish tillage sector has by far the lowest greenhouse gas emissions compared to other agricultural sectors, according to state body Teagasc. Bobby Miller, Stradbally, Co Laois I must disagree with Larry Dunne that “banning mobile phones in schools is just another excuse for teachers to assert control” (Letters, Irish Independent, October 10). Teachers do need to have control in their classrooms and I don’t believe any excuses are needed. A smartphone is not just a phone, it is also a camera, a calculator and a computer. Schools are well equipped with calculators and computers, so there is no need for smartphones in classrooms. A camera is not necessary in classrooms, either, and in my opinion smartphones should not be allowed in schools at all, as they can be used as tools of intimidation and bullying of both students and teachers. Most of all, phones are a distraction to students who can hear message alerts if they have them in their schoolbags. Marion Dermody, Co Kildare Ciara Kelly’s excellent comment article (‘Acts of abuse by trusted educators have devastating impacts reaching far beyond the boys who were the actual victims of these vile men’, Irish Independent, October 7) brought back some very unpleasant buried memories of my eight years boarding in Willow Park and Blackrock College in the 1960s. One such memory was the priest who chased us around the fields of Willow Park trying to hit us on the bum with his biffer – a short, thick leather strap. I actually remember running so hard as I knew being hit by this vile object was extremely painful. ​ Brian Mc Devitt, Glenties, Co Donegal Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

The world’s largest asset manager BlackRock has seen its asset under management (AUM) surge by a whopping $160 billion during the third quarter of the year, to now have a record-breaking $11.5 trillion in AUM. According to a recent Bloomberg report, investors were particularly drawn to BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) offerings – which include a spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) – investing $97 billion in these funds. Additionally, fixed-income investments saw a significant influx of $63 billion, leading the company’s year-to-date inflows to $360 billion, a figure that surpasses its total net flows seen in both 2022 and 2023. BlackRock has garnered an impressive $360 billion in net inflows year-to-date, surpassing its total net flows for both 2022 and 2023. BlackRock has further solidified its position as a one-stop shop for investments by completing the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion. The deal added $116 billion in private market assets to BlackRock’s portfolio, which has also seen strong demand for cash management and money-market funds, attracting $61 billion in net flows during the quarter. The firm’s growth has been fueled by a favorable market environment, with a surge in stocks and increasing investor interest in fixed-income and private funds. The S&P 500 Index’s ‘unstoppable’ rise so far this year and expectations for a less aggressive Federal Reserve rate hike have contributed to this positive trend. BlackRock’s financial performance saw its adjusted net income per share rise 5% to $11.46 and revenue 15% to $5.2 billion. Its market-leading spot Bitcoin ETF, according to CoinGlass data, currently has around $17.2 billion of assets under management, far above its closest competitors, Grayscale’s GBTC and Fidelity’s FBTC, which have $13.1 billion and $9.9 billion in AUM, respectively.

Companies like Tesla, Amazon, Google, TikTok, Snap and Microsoft have conducted sizable layoffs in the first months of 2024. Smaller-sized startups have also seen a fair amount of cuts, and in some cases, have shut down operations altogether. By tracking these layoffs, we’re able to understand the impact on innovation across companies large and small. We’re also able to see the potential impact of businesses embracing AI and automation for jobs that had previously been considered safe. It also serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs and what could be at stake in regards to increased innovation.

Major U.S. equities indexes ticked higher during the week's final trading session as the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) data showed wholesale prices remained flat in September after rising 0.2% in the previous month. The decline in wholesale inflation suggests relatively limited upward pressure on consumer prices in the coming months, which might influence the Federal Reserve as it considers additional interest-rate cuts. The S&P 500 gained 0.6%, closing above 5,800 for the first time in the benchmark index's history. The Dow surged 1.0%, joining the S&P 500 in printing a record close. The Nasdaq was up 0.3%. Tesla (TSLA) made headlines with an event held Thursday evening to unveil its Cybercab, the electric vehicle maker's highly anticipated autonomous robotaxi. However, the launch failed to impress investors, and Tesla shares tumbled 8.8% on Friday, suffering the heaviest loss of any S&P 500 stock. Bernstein analysts commented on the lack of detail provided by Tesla, particularly in terms of the regulatory approval process and central monitoring functions for robotaxis. Analysts also hoped for more specifics on safety measures and compatibility with other Tesla EVs. The lukewarm response to Telsa's Cybercab helped boost shares of ridesharing companies that will face competition from the implementation of self-driving taxis. Uber Technologies (UBER) shares jumped 10.8%, notching the top performance in the S&P 500 and hitting a record high. Shares of Uber rival Lyft (LYFT) were up 9.6%. Fastenal (FAST), a producer of nuts, bolts, screws, and other industrial supplies, topped analysts' estimates with its sales and profit results for the third quarter. Solid demand for the company's safety products helped drive the strong results, even as Hurricane Helene caused a disruption to sales. Fastenal shares ended 9.8% higher on Friday. Shares of industrial maintenance, repair, and operation (MRO) supplier W.W. Grainger (GWW) popped 5.8% to reach an all-time high. In its most recent earnings report, released in August, Grainger reported year-over-year sales growth, boosted by strength in its High-Touch Solutions and Endless Assortment segments. Bank earnings season kicked off on Friday as two of the country's largest financial institutions released quarterly results, with more companies set to follow suit next week. Wells Fargo (WFC) shares jumped 5.6% after the bank reported better-than-expected revenue and net income for the third quarter. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the world's largest bank by market capitalization, also beat top- and bottom-line forecasts while reporting year-over-year gains in net interest income (NII), and its shares added 4.4%. Shares of Bank of America (BAC), which is set to release results on Tuesday, were up 5.0%. A.O. Smith (AOS) shares dropped 6.3% after the water heater and boiler manufacturer reported lackluster preliminary results for the third quarter, predicting sales and earnings per share (EPS) to come in below consensus estimates. The company also reduced its full-year profit guidance, citing weak demand for residential and commercial water heaters in North America as well as a cautious outlook for Chinese markets during the second half of the year. Shares of Align Technology (ALGN), maker of orthodontics products, fell 3.3% after Stifel cut its price target on the stock. Analysts also lowered their full-year revenue and earnings estimates, indicating that they do not expect Align to reach an inflection point in the near term.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) may have disappointed investors with its Advancing AI event Thursday, but analysts said they're still bullish on the chipmaker's growth prospects. While AMD unveiled a number of new AI products at the event, Jefferies analysts said investors may have been looking for clearer signs of competition with Nvidia (NVDA) and a new customer announcement, as well as "the potential for a raise of the AI guidance to $5 billion, which is likely now left to earnings." Shares of AMD fell 4% Thursday after the event, though they recovered some of those losses with a just over 2% gain Friday. Bank of America analysts said AMD's latest Instinct MI325X GPU “remains a full year behind NVDA's latest Blackwell, with no near-term catalyst to change the dynamic." Jefferies analysts suggested AMD's MI350 next year "would compete more favorably" with Nvidia's Blackwell, "leaving AMD chasing NVDA for now." However, the analysts said they believe AMD's new AI chips could still "drive further share gains" as companies race to build out their AI infrastructure, with "enough demand to go around." Jefferies maintained its "buy" rating for the stock and price target of $190, a more than 13% premium over Friday's closing price of $167.89. Bank of America also maintained a "buy" rating with a price objective of $180. About three-quarters or 13 of the other 17 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha also held "buy" or equivalent ratings for the stock as of Friday, with a consensus target of $192.13.

Broadcom Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AVGO) Chief Legal & Corporate Affairs Officer, Mark David Brazeal, has sold 18,900 shares of company stock, according to a recent SEC filing. The transaction, which took place on October 9, was executed at a price of $182.875 per share, resulting in a total sale value of approximately $3.46 million. The sale has adjusted Brazeal's direct holdings in Broadcom to 380,560 shares, which includes 303,750 restricted stock units as noted in the filing's footnotes. The reported stock sale is part of the regular disclosures made by company insiders, providing investors with up-to-date information on executive transactions. Broadcom Inc., a leader in the semiconductor industry, continues to be a significant player in the technology sector. Insider sales such as these are common and are often scheduled well in advance as part of personal financial planning or diversification strategies for executives. Investors and market watchers frequently monitor insider trades to gain insights into a company's internal perspective and potential future performance. While such transactions are a regular part of corporate operations, they can sometimes provide context for the market's understanding of a company's valuation and executive confidence. As of the last filing, Broadcom shares are traded on the NASDAQ, under the ticker symbol AVGO. The company has not made any official statements regarding this latest stock transaction by one of its top executives. In other recent news, Broadcom has been making significant strides in the tech industry. The company recently issued $5 billion in senior notes, a strategic move aimed at repaying existing debt. This move was followed by the unveiling of Sian™2, a 200G/lane PAM-4 DSP PHY designed to enhance data center connectivity for AI applications. Broadcom's recent financial performance revealed a 47% year-over-year increase, with consolidated net revenue reaching $13.1 billion. The firm's partnership with Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) for the production of Wi-Fi 7 RF front-end modules is also expected to enhance mobile connectivity performance. BofA Securities and Truist Securities maintained their Buy ratings on Broadcom, citing the company's strong position in the AI market and its robust financial structure. TD Cowen and Baird also reiterated their positive ratings, emphasizing Broadcom's progress in key growth areas such as Networking and AI. These recent developments reflect Broadcom's ongoing activities in the capital markets and its commitment to maintaining a robust financial structure amid dynamic market conditions. The company's strategic financial decisions and positioning in the market continue to attract investor interest. Broadcom's recent insider sale by Chief Legal & Corporate Affairs Officer Mark David Brazeal comes at a time when the company's stock is performing exceptionally well. According to InvestingPro data, Broadcom has seen a remarkable 115.6% price total return over the past year, with a 68.14% return year-to-date. This strong performance is reflected in the stock trading near its 52-week high, at 97.35% of that peak. The company's financial health appears robust, with InvestingPro Tips highlighting that Broadcom has raised its dividend for 14 consecutive years and maintained dividend payments for 15 years. This consistency in shareholder returns is complemented by a current dividend yield of 1.14%, according to recent data. Broadcom's market position remains strong, with InvestingPro Tips noting it as a prominent player in the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry. The company's revenue growth is impressive, with a 32.04% increase in the last twelve months as of Q3 2024, and a quarterly growth of 47.27% in Q3 2024. However, investors should note that Broadcom is trading at high valuation multiples. The P/E ratio stands at 160.94, with an adjusted P/E of 120.46 for the last twelve months. This high valuation is consistent across other metrics, including EBIT, EBITDA, and revenue multiples, as pointed out by InvestingPro Tips. For those interested in a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers 17 additional tips for Broadcom, providing a comprehensive view of the company's financial position and market performance.

Financial powerhouses including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and BlackRock reported strong earnings on Friday, sending shares soaring and Wall Street into new record territory. U.S.: Tesla keeps Nasdaq in check while Dow and S&P set recordsThe S&P 500 set another new record, its second this week, climbing 0.61% Friday on positive earnings and producer price index data. Same goes for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which climbed 0.97% to close at another all-time high. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had to contend with Tesla shares tumbling after the launch of the Cybercab. Europe: U.S. data has ripple effect, sending stocks upEuropean stocks hovered early Friday but closed up, with the UK’s FTSE 100 climbing 0.19% and the STOXX Europe 600 at 0.55% on positive earnings reports from big banks on Wall Street. The markets had a lot to digest Friday, including a stimulus briefing planned in Beijing and France’s new draft budget. China: Shares slip ahead of stimulus briefingA day after China shares rebounded on stimulus optimism, Shanghai’s SSE Composite slid 2.5%. Markets are cautious ahead of Beijing’s Saturday briefing, at which investors are hoping for more measures to boost the economy. Hong Kong markets were closed for a public holiday. Japan: Nikkei posts small rise on the back of banks and Uniqlo The Nikkei 225 notched a 0.57% rise as it headed into the weekend, led by the financial sector and a 6.09% jump in Uniqlo-owner Fast Retailing, which hit an all-time high after reporting stronger-than-expected revenue and profits for the year. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Banks Compensate for Drop by Tesla as More Records Fall

US stocks rose to records Friday as big banks rallied following a run of reassuring profit reports. The Dow rose 409.74 points, or 1%, to 42,863.86, a record. The S&P 500 rose 34.98 points, or 0.6%, to 5,815.03, topping its all-time high set earlier in the week. The Nasdaq rose 60.89 points, or 0.3%, to 18,342.94, held down by Tesla's slide. Wells Fargo rose 5.6% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, the AP reports. It benefited from better results from its venture-capital investments and higher fees for investment-banking services, among other factors. Banks and other financial giants traditionally kick off each earnings reporting season, and JPMorgan Chase climbed 4.4% after reporting a milder drop in profit than analysts feared. That was the strongest single force pushing upward on the S&P 500. CEO Jamie Dimon said the nation's largest bank is also still buying back shares of its stock to send cash to investors, though the pace is modest "given that market levels are at least slightly inflated." BlackRock rose 3.6% after likewise delivering better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The investment giant ended September managing a record $11.5 trillion in total assets for its customers. The gains for banks helped make up for the drag of Tesla, which tumbled 8.8% and was the heaviest weight on the market. The electric-vehicle maker unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi on Thursday night, but critics highlighted a lack of details about its planned rollout. Following the unveiling of the "Cybercab," potential rival Uber Technologies jumped 10.8% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. Lyft rose 9.6%. (More Wall Street stories.)

Title: Treasury Yields Have Been Rising. How Might That Affect Your Stock Portfolio?

The yield on 10-year Treasurys crossed 4.1% for the first time since July this week, extending an ascent that has paradoxically coincided with the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle. The yield on the 10-year Treasury has risen by about half a percentage point since dipping below 3.6% on Sept. 17, the day before the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark federal funds rate from its highest level in more than 20 years. Stock investors are often unnerved by rising yields for a few reasons. First, they draw money away from the stock market and lower stock valuations by increasing the yield on lower-risk fixed-income securities. Second, they discourage consumer and business borrowing, weighing on economic growth and corporate profits in the process. Yet rising Treasury yields haven't stood in the way of stocks in recent weeks. The S&P 500 on Friday closed at its 45th record high of the year as the 10-year yield was at a two-month high. Major stock indexes have posted gains in five consecutive weeks. Stocks have been supported lately by growing conviction on Wall Street that the U.S. economy’s strength can support corporate profits. Earnings have mostly held up through years of elevated interest rates, and the Fed’s easing cycle—whether aggressive or more measured—should mostly be a tailwind for business and stocks. Bank of America analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to grow 15% next year. They also forecast growth will continue to broaden beyond the Magnificent Seven—Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA)—which accounted for an outsized share of the index’s earnings growth and market performance in 2023. The "Other 493," the earnings of which were declining or stagnant throughout 2023 and early 2024, are expected to record double-digit earnings growth in each of the next five quarters. According to one study from British asset manager Schroders, rising yields compressed stock valuations in 6 of the 11 periods between 1970 and 2021 that they characterize as "rising yield environments." And yet stocks advanced in all but two of those periods because earnings grew fast enough to offset lower valuations. Few experts expect the 10-year yield to rise much further than it already has, another reason yields are unlikely to derail the bull market. “The US economy is healthy & unlikely to see recession near term but it also doesn't appear to be meaningfully re-accelerating,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a recent note. They expect the Fed to continue cutting rates next year, and forecast the 10-year yield will sit around 3.75% at the end of both 2024 and 2025. Lawrence Gillum, Chief Fixed Income Strategist at LPL Financial, sees a little more room for rates to tick up but still expects yields to fluctuate within a 3.75-4.25% range throughout the rest of the year. The surprising strength of the U.S. economy is a key reason for the peculiar divergence between interest rates and yields. The unemployment rate declined in September when the U.S. added far more jobs than expected, according to data from the Labor Department released last week. And inflation ran slightly hot in September, according to data released Thursday. That’s led Wall Street to doubt the Fed will need to continue aggressively cutting rates to prevent an economic crisis. Last month, the prevailing view among market participants was that the Fed would lower rates by another 75 basis points (0.75%) before the end of the year. Now, the market sees no chance the Fed will move that quickly, according to fed fund futures trading data. As the outlook for interest rates has changed, so has the market price of Treasurys and, subsequently, their yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices. When investors think that interest rates are going to be lower in the future than they are now, that increases the price—and decreases the yield—of Treasurys trading on the secondary market because they’re expected to pay a higher coupon than future debt. The opposite happens when investors think interest rates will be higher in the future, and the strength of recent labor market data has convinced Wall Street of that.

Title: BlackRock Tops $11.5 Trillion in AUM, More Bitcoin Bets Ahead?

U.Today - American multinational investment giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has extended its lead as the world’s dominant asset manager with an $11.5 trillion Asset Under Management (AUM) milestone. As revealed in its third-quarter earnings report, the company said its AUM jumped $2.4 trillion year-over-year, driven by net inflows of $456 billion and positive market movements. This product marked a complete pivot for BlackRock, a traditionally conservative firm. In line with its adoption of Bitcoin, CEO Larry Fink is now one of the major advocates of the digital currency. With the AUM boost, it remains unclear what the firm plans for its iShares Bitcoin Trust product overall. While the Bitcoin ETF is BlackRock's flagship and most popular crypto product, BlackRock is also fully invested in iShares Ethereum Trust, the ETH ETF. Despite the generally poorer performance of Ethereum ETF products, BlackRock remains in the lead among issuers overall. With the massive uptick in BlackRock AUM, it may be inferred that Bitcoin and Ethereum contributed significantly to this new milestone. As a regulated investment outfit, BlackRock is combining a conservative approach with new tech adoption. As such, its current capital base might encourage it to take more calculated risks in the coin moving forward. Despite BlackRock's stance, not all rivals share its vision for Bitcoin. Firms like Vanguard have specifically issued a highly publicized disclaimer that it will not get involved with Bitcoin, or crypto in general. This article was originally published on U.Today

Title: TikTok axes 500 jobs in Malaysia, embraces AI for global content moderation
URL: https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/tiktok-axes-500-jobs-in-malaysia-embraces-ai-for-global-content-moderation

Content moderation got next on AI's job chopping block. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. TikTok laid off up to 700 employees, predominantly from its Malaysian operations (via Reuters). Contrary to the massive layoffs experienced across significant tech corporations like Microsoft that have been linked to tough economic times, the ByteDance-owned company plans to replace the laid-off employees with generative AI. The rapid progression of generative AI continues to be a menace for professionals across organizations, potentially rubbishing the false sense of job security. The affected employees' roles were centered on content moderation, ensuring clips published on the viral platform adhere to community guidelines. ByteDance claims it has established that AI can flag and scrap content violating TikTok's community guidelines with an 80% success rate. As such, the company is seemingly leaning toward automating content moderation using AI to expedite the process while simultaneously promoting efficiency. Two people with close knowledge of the matter told Reuters that the job cuts impacted less than 500 employees, not 700 as previously assumed. And as it now seems, the job cuts will likely expand to other regions and countries as TikTok scales greater heights with its content moderation automation process using AI. According to Microsoft's latest Work Trend Index report, most company executives won't hire anyone without an AI aptitude, "a 142x increase in LinkedIn members adding AI skills like Copilot and ChatGPT to their profiles." Interestingly, the report further suggests that AI creates job opportunities contrary to popular belief that it will render professionals jobless. However, company executives have raised concerns that despite having multiple vacancies across their organizations, there isn't enough talent to fill them. In a separate report, image generation tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot are getting exceptionally good at creating structural designs, posing a great danger to the future of professionals in the built environment. Interestingly, the AI tools can't make simple, plain white creations. AI isn't leaving any stone unturned in the banking sector either. According to a study, 54% of banking jobs (more than half) have a high affinity for automation, with the possibility of 12% being augmented by AI. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman claims the fast adoption of AI in organizations will prompt software developers to stop coding, prompting them to upskill in the field to gain new skills. According to Garman: "If you go forward 24 months from now, or some amount of time — I can't exactly predict where it is — it's possible that most developers are not coding." NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang echoed similar sentiments earlier this year. Huang claims coding could potentially be dead in the water as a potential career path for the next generation. Instead, he encourages the youth to explore alternative career options in biology, education, manufacturing, or farming.

The billionaire's prediction sparked controversy, with the vast majority asking how people would make a living. He painted a picture of a government social welfare concept that allocates a specific amount of money to everyone to cater to basic needs regularly. However, a job-free utopia raises questions about emotional fulfillment among people.

Title: What Happens When a Stock Is Dropped From the S&P 500?

Time Published: 2024-10-11T17:11:35Z
Full Content:
Being listed on the S&P 500 is a hallmark of success for many companies, symbolizing market leadership and investor confidence. However, it's not uncommon for companies to sometimes be delisted from this prestigious index. In fact, the average life span of a company on the S&P 500 is about years. Delisting can occur for several reasons and may have immediate negative consequences for the company and its investors, affecting stock prices and market perceptions. Understanding what happens when a stock is delisted from the S&P 500 is crucial for investors and stakeholders. Read on to better understand the reasons behind delisting, its impact, and how recent examples shed light on this aspect of the stock market. The S&P 500, short for Standard & Poor's 500, is one of the most widely followed stock market indexes in the world. It represents the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S. Along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Nasdaq composite, the S&P 500 is considered one of the main benchmarks of the U.S. stock market's health and performance. The index is host to many of the world's most important companies and household names, including the following (by market cap weight as of the fourth quarter of 2024): The S&P 500 has specific criteria for including companies in the index. While the choice by S&P 500 about inclusion is more than just specific measures, these are the main thresholds a company must meet: The S&P 500 is not simply a list of the 500 largest companies by market capitalization. The inclusion process involves careful consideration by the index committee. They meet quarterly to review which companies to add or drop. The committee also monitors for significant developments (such as mergers, bankruptcies, or restructuring) that might affect index composition. While meeting the inclusion criteria is necessary, it doesn't guarantee being included. The committee has discretion when adding new companies. When adding or removing companies, the committee aims to decrease index turnover while ensuring the index represents the large-cap U.S. equity market. The index's composition changes are typically announced with several days' notice. This allows index funds and other market participants time to prepare for the change. Companies can be removed from the S&P 500 for various reasons, which we can broadly categorize into voluntary and involuntary delistings: Some companies delist themselves from the S&P 500 or other major indexes. Reasons for voluntary delisting include the following: More commonly, companies are involuntarily removed from the S&P 500 because of failing to meet the index's criteria. Reasons can include the following: When a stock is removed from the S&P 500, it typically has significant effects on the stock and its investors. Short-Term Consequences: Long-Term Consequences: Companies that fall out of the S&P 500 can be included again. For example, Dell was in the S&P 500 before going private in 2013. The company was relisted in the index Sept. 23, 2024, to mark its 40th anniversary. Being added to the S&P 500 is often a significant achievement for a company. It brings several benefits, many of which are the opposite of being removed from the index: Here are several of the major companies removed from the index in 2024: Whirlpool, a major U.S. manufacturer of home appliances, was removed from the S&P 500 index in early 2024. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of American Airlines (AAL) from the S&P 500 in 2024 reflected broader challenges facing the airline industry and the company's specific financial struggles. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of Etsy Inc. (ETSY) from the S&P 500 was driven by changes in consumer behavior and ever more competition in ecommerce. Reasons for delisting: Effects: Other companies removed from the S&P 500 in 2024 include the following firms: As companies are moved out of the S&P 500 index, new companies are added to take their place. In 2024, the following were some of those added: You don't get your money back when a stock is removed from the index. You still own the same number of shares in the company. However, the value of those shares may decrease, and it may become more difficult to sell them. Index funds are mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. It provides investors with broad market exposure and typically offers lower fees than actively managed funds, as it simply mimics the composition of the chosen index rather than trying to outperform it. This depends on your investment strategy and the specific circumstances of the stock's removal. Stock prices are often negatively affected following its removal. In any case, it's important to reassess the company's fundamentals and prospects. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice if needed. Being delisted from the S&P 500 is a significant event for any company, often leading to immediate and negative consequences, such as a drop in stock price and reduced visibility. It can be voluntary because of a merger, going private, a falling market cap, or not meeting other index criteria. However, it's important to remember that delisting doesn't necessarily mean a company is doomed to fail. Some companies use this as a chance to restructure, refocus, and potentially return more robust than before. For investors, a stock's delisting from the S&P 500 should prompt a careful reassessment of the investment.

Being listed on the S&P 500 is a hallmark of success for many companies, symbolizing market leadership and investor confidence. However, it's not uncommon for companies to sometimes be delisted from this prestigious index. In fact, the average life span of a company on the S&P 500 is about years. Delisting can occur for several reasons and may have immediate negative consequences for the company and its investors, affecting stock prices and market perceptions. Understanding what happens when a stock is delisted from the S&P 500 is crucial for investors and stakeholders. Read on to better understand the reasons behind delisting, its impact, and how recent examples shed light on this aspect of the stock market. The S&P 500, short for Standard & Poor's 500, is one of the most widely followed stock market indexes in the world. It represents the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S. Along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Nasdaq composite, the S&P 500 is considered one of the main benchmarks of the U.S. stock market's health and performance. The index is host to many of the world's most important companies and household names, including the following (by market cap weight as of the fourth quarter of 2024): The S&P 500 has specific criteria for including companies in the index. While the choice by S&P 500 about inclusion is more than just specific measures, these are the main thresholds a company must meet: The S&P 500 is not simply a list of the 500 largest companies by market capitalization. The inclusion process involves careful consideration by the index committee. They meet quarterly to review which companies to add or drop. The committee also monitors for significant developments (such as mergers, bankruptcies, or restructuring) that might affect index composition. While meeting the inclusion criteria is necessary, it doesn't guarantee being included. The committee has discretion when adding new companies. When adding or removing companies, the committee aims to decrease index turnover while ensuring the index represents the large-cap U.S. equity market. The index's composition changes are typically announced with several days' notice. This allows index funds and other market participants time to prepare for the change. Companies can be removed from the S&P 500 for various reasons, which we can broadly categorize into voluntary and involuntary delistings: Some companies delist themselves from the S&P 500 or other major indexes. Reasons for voluntary delisting include the following: More commonly, companies are involuntarily removed from the S&P 500 because of failing to meet the index's criteria. Reasons can include the following: When a stock is removed from the S&P 500, it typically has significant effects on the stock and its investors. Short-Term Consequences: Long-Term Consequences: Companies that fall out of the S&P 500 can be included again. For example, Dell was in the S&P 500 before going private in 2013. The company was relisted in the index Sept. 23, 2024, to mark its 40th anniversary. Being added to the S&P 500 is often a significant achievement for a company. It brings several benefits, many of which are the opposite of being removed from the index: Here are several of the major companies removed from the index in 2024: Whirlpool, a major U.S. manufacturer of home appliances, was removed from the S&P 500 index in early 2024. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of American Airlines (AAL) from the S&P 500 in 2024 reflected broader challenges facing the airline industry and the company's specific financial struggles. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of Etsy Inc. (ETSY) from the S&P 500 was driven by changes in consumer behavior and ever more competition in ecommerce. Reasons for delisting: Effects: Other companies removed from the S&P 500 in 2024 include the following firms: As companies are moved out of the S&P 500 index, new companies are added to take their place. In 2024, the following were some of those added: You don't get your money back when a stock is removed from the index. You still own the same number of shares in the company. However, the value of those shares may decrease, and it may become more difficult to sell them. Index funds are mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. It provides investors with broad market exposure and typically offers lower fees than actively managed funds, as it simply mimics the composition of the chosen index rather than trying to outperform it. This depends on your investment strategy and the specific circumstances of the stock's removal. Stock prices are often negatively affected following its removal. In any case, it's important to reassess the company's fundamentals and prospects. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice if needed. Being delisted from the S&P 500 is a significant event for any company, often leading to immediate and negative consequences, such as a drop in stock price and reduced visibility. It can be voluntary because of a merger, going private, a falling market cap, or not meeting other index criteria. However, it's important to remember that delisting doesn't necessarily mean a company is doomed to fail. Some companies use this as a chance to restructure, refocus, and potentially return more robust than before.

Title: AMD Launches MI325 AI Accelerator To Challenge Nvidia. Stock Fell 4.5%

Chasing Nvidia is hard; Team Green simultaneously countered with new software that can triple AI performance. Consequently, AMD’s performance claims are already out of date. And AMD compared it against the older Hopper, not Blackwell which will ship long before the MI325. AMD continues to make excellent progress on the hardware and software front for advancing AI. However, AMD’s performance claims are unrealistic since they again did not use Nvidia’s optimization software. Nonetheless, the MI325 is fast and boasts a huge amount of HBM3E (288GB). Before we dive into the AI accelerator, let’s look at the new 5th-gen EPYC CPU or Turin they just announced to see if they are maintaining their lead over Intel Xeon. The fifth-generation EPYC CPU offers up to 192 efficiency cores for web apps and up to 192 cores for performance-demanding apps. However, we note that AMD again chose to forgo on-chip AI acceleration, which Intel added to Xeon for the last two generations. It seems strange, but I suspect this is what the hyperscalers told AMD they preferred. Nonetheless, we expect AMD to continue increasing its market share in data center CPUs. EPYC supports 128 fast cores or 192 not-so-fast cores. But no AI! AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su kicked off the AI portion of the event by updating the company’s projected market size for AI accelerators in the data center to $500B by 2028. At last December’s launch for the MI300, she predicted the market would exceed $400 billion by 2027, so its not clear that this is much of an increase. But while AMD investors sold, driving down AMD’s price by over 4.5%, Nvidia reached a near record high, up over 1%. AMD has updated its market forecast for AI to $500B in 2028. The primary difference between the MI300 and MI325 is the amount of HBM3, which we assume are stacked 12 DDR chips high. The 256GB of HBM is 80% more memory than on the Nvidia H100 and 50% more than the H200. This additional memory can matter a lot, as models get larger. Meta said on stage that 100% of their inference processing on Llama 405B is being serviced by the MI300X. I wonder if that will remain the case now that Nvidia announced on the same day that they increased performance of Llama 405B on the H200 by another 50%. The MI325 has 256GB of HBM3E, far ahead of NVIDIA. How fast is the new MI325X? AMD claimed (without providing details like what software was used and the size of the input sequence) that the 325 is 40% faster than the soon-to-be-old H200 for certain inference workloads. If history is a guide, we can be certain this benchmark did not use Nvidia’s optimizing software which can easily increase performance by 2-4 times. AMD claims a 40% performance lead over H100, but again they did not use Nvidia's latest software. AMD also touted their ROCm 6.2 software which essentially replaces Nvidia’s CUDA libraries. Surprisingly. AMD did not update ROCm with anything like TensorRT LLM, which can again increase performance dramatically. AMD shows that they, too, can improve performance with software enhancements. And AMD teased next years MI350 series, which they claim will have better performance, and will support FP4, which is not supported on MI325 but is supported on Blackwell. Lisa Su talked about next year's MI350, when AMD will add lower precision now available in Nvidia ... [+] Blackwell. If you don’t think a developer would use Nvidia’s optimization software to increase performance by 2-4X (and I gotta meet this guy!), then one can conclude the MI325 is faster than the H200. If you use AMD’s optimizations in ROCm. The larger HBM will attract a lot of users, however, like Meta. We will have to wait to see how much the MI350 can improve the contrast with Blackwell, which AMD ignored in the event. Like I said at the start, competing with Nvidia is hard. VERY hard.

Title: Tesla stock sinks as ‘toothless’ robotaxi disappoints

Tesla (TSLA) stock sank more than 7% Friday midday as investors signaled disappointment over the EV maker’s robotaxi debut. Following the event on Thursday night, “We, Robot” — which aimed to cement CEO Elon Musk’s position as an AI leader — investors and analysts came away with more skepticism than excitement over Tesla’s lofty vision for a future of driverless cabs. Jefferies (JEF) analysts called Tesla’s $30,000 robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, a “toothless taxi” in a note to investors Friday morning, adding that Tesla has “ambitious targets" with “little evidence of feasibility.” “We believe TSLA potentially underappreciates the obstacles to scaling a robotaxi fleet,” they wrote. Tesla’s new Cybercab has no steering wheel or pedals and is designed to be fully autonomous, Yahoo Finance’s Pras Subramanian reported. The company said it will begin unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) trials with Model 3 and Model Y test vehicles next year in Texas and California. Tesla is aiming to begin Cybercab production “before 2027,” Musk said. Tesla’s stock drop on Friday extended a two-week decline. TSLA shares fell last week after the company missed Wall Street estimates on its third quarter deliveries, issued a recall, and discontinued a lower-priced model. The stock — which has experienced far more volatility over the past year than its Magnificent Seven peers — is down 17% from last year. Still, TSLA’s Friday price of $220 per share is far higher than lows below $140 this spring. Shares hit a 15-month low in April amid Tesla’s layoffs and price cuts. Investors and analysts had hoped the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event would live up to the hype but were disappointed by Musk’s lack of clarity over how the company would achieve its ambitious goals. Raymond James (RJF) analyst Josh Beck called Tesla’s plan to commercialize its Cybercabs “vague” and “underwhelming.” Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts said the event included a “disappointing lack of detail” about updates to Tesla's FSD technology and market strategy. RBC Capital analyst Tom Narayan concurred, writing in a note Friday that investors believe Musk’s vision “was light of real numbers and timelines.” “These typically come at Tesla events,” he added. “This one seemed focused on branding and marketing Tesla's vision, rather than giving concrete numbers for us to model out.” Additionally, Tesla did not reveal details about a lower-priced vehicle as some investors had hoped. That vehicle is expected to launch in the first half of 2025, analysts noted. To be sure, some experts on Wall Street think “We, Robot” was a success. Bank of America analysts said the robotaxi event “lived up to the hype.” Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives said in a note Friday, “We believe last night was a glimpse of the future of Tesla and next generation transportation for consumers.” He also noted the presence of Tesla’s humanoid robot Optimus, which was “well ahead” of Wedbush expectations. Musk said Optimus could be "[the] biggest product ever of any kind" in terms of commercial success, Bank of America (BAC) analysts noted. The AI tech underlying the robot is the same as that used in Tesla’s vehicles. “We think this speaks to the fact that at this point TSLA is more than a traditional automotive company,” Bank of America analysts said. While noting the lack of details on Tesla’s Cybercab rollout, Wedbush’s Ives said, “[W]e strongly disagree with the notion that last night was a disappointment as we would argue the opposite seeing Cybercab with our own eyes and the massive improvements in Optimus which we interacted with throughout the evening.” The overall muted reaction to Tesla’s robotaxi launch is a good sign for ride-hailing companies Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT). “Clearly building and launching a service is the longer-term direction for Tesla but the vagueness around the service (or clarity in not saying it) may reduce fears that UBER and LYFT would have to start defending share as soon as next — which was our primary fear coming in,” RBC's Narayan said. Uber and Lyft shares both jumped around 10% Friday. Wall Street has mixed opinions on Tesla stock. Some 26 of Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying it, while 20 have a Hold rating and 15 advise investors to sell it. Overall, analysts see shares falling to $216.59 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

Title: Streaming Units Are Starting Beginning To Be Profitable
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2024/10/11/streaming-units-are-starting-beginning-to-be-profitable/
Time Published: 2024-10-11T15:08:37Z

After years of losing revenue, streaming video platfroms are beginning to be profitable. These units ... [+] have embarked on several strategies designed to grow revenue. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) Only Netflix, up until recently, was able to reliably declare a profit among major streaming providers. The remaining streaming units, owned by legacy media companies, have only begun to be profitable. Becoming profitable comes at a critical time for media companies as revenue from cable television has been in a freefall. In August, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount Global took write downs on their linear TV business that collectively totaled $15 billion. Overall, the combined profits of Disney, Paramount, Comcast, Netflix and Warner Bros Discovery during the first two quarters of 2024 totaled $3.3 billion which is an increase from $683 million loss from the previous year, according to Yahoo Finance. In its most recent earnings report, Disney’s streaming unit (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+) generated a quarterly profit of $47 million. It marked the first time Disney’s direct-to-consumer unit was profitable. When ESPN+ is not included, Disney recorded a loss of $19 million. One year earlier, Disney’s streaming division had reported a loss of $512 million. In its most recent earnings report, Paramount+ — the streaming unit of Paramount Global — became profitable for the first time. Paramount+ generated revenue of $26 million, compared to a loss of $424 million a year earlier. The streaming unit of Warner Bros Discovery (Max and Discovery+), had an adjusted loss of $107 million in its most recent earnings report. For calendar year 2023 however, the direct-to-consumer unit boasted a profit of $103 million. It marked the first time a streaming unit from a legacy media company had been profitable for an entire year. Although Comcast’s Peacock, in its most recent earnings report, reported a revenue loss of $348 million, the streaming unit is improving. Peacock, one year prior, had a revenue loss of $651 million. In all of 2023, Peacock lost $2.75 billion. Meanwhile, category leader Netflix continues to be the most profitable streaming provider. In its latest earnings quarterly report, Netflix recorded a net income of $2.15 billion, a year-over-year increase from $1.49 billion. Netflix revenue for the quarter was $9.56 billion, an increase of +17% from one year prior. There are several reasons for the recent improvement in revenue including increased subscriber fees, cracking down on password sharing and selling ads among other reasons. All streaming providers have to some degree increased their monthly subscriber fees to consumers. Monthly subscriber rates for leading streaming providers (Netflix, Peacock, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Disney+ and Prime Video), have collectively grown from $59 in 2019 to $110 — an over 73% increase, The Drum reported. As an example, the monthly cost for the ad free tier of Disney+ has doubled from $6.99 in 2019 to $13.99 today. The monthly increase for the ad free tier of Peacock was even steeper, increasing from $4.99 in 2019 to $13.99. Steep increases in subscriber fees can backfire. A recent report from Deloitte found the households on average are paying $61 monthly, a year-over-year increase of 27% for on average four streaming providers. Many are of the opinion the cost is not worth it. In an interview, Michael Nathanson, Senior Managing Director at MoffettNathanson, noted, “For streaming, the average number of services per household has been stuck at four for a while. One of those four is Netflix, the second is Amazon—it comes with Prime—and third is some combination of Disney’s offerings. Fourth place is up for grabs. That’s what all the rest are fighting over.” The Disney acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2019 and the merger of WarnerMedia with Discovery Communications in 2022 may have been caused by concerns of having too many streaming options. Another reason for revenue increases has been the cracking down on password sharing. Netflix took the lead in 2023 when it announced people using somebody’s password would have to start their own account. The risky decision has been working; in the past year, Netflix paid subscriber counts grew by 16.5%, exceeding estimates. Netflix is rapidly approaching 300 million (278 million) subscribers globally. Other streaming services have announced crackdowns on password sharing. Disney recently announced it would be implementing an initiative to crack down on passwords. Disney+ has introduced a new paid sharing tier. Disney’s Hulu has also curtailed password sharing. Warner Bros Discovery is also putting limits on password sharing. While Paramount+ and Peacock suggest they share passwords only within the household, neither have enforced that recommendation. As some subscribers dropped their streaming services, because of rising costs another revenue strategy has been launching an ad supported tier, at a lower subscription cost. In late 2022. both Netflix and Disney+ launched ad supported tiers. The announcements came at a time when advertisers were allocating more of the ad budget toward connected TV. In first quarter 2024, eMarketer reported 7.5% of Netflix subscribers in the U.S. have opted for less costly ad supported tier, the lowest of any streamer, followed by Max at 20.8%. Amazon’s Prime Video had the highest with 80% of subscribers receiving ads, followed by Peacock at 77.7%. According to the report, 25% of Disney+ subscribers are using the ad supported tier. For the 2024 upfronts ad dollars for Netflix grew by +150% compared to last year. There are forecasts Netflix will generate over $1 billion in ad revenue this year, surpassing Disney+. Streaming video has premium (award-winning) content coupled with younger viewers compared to linear television with fewer ads. All are appealing to advertisers. On the down side is streaming platforms have a higher cost-per-thousand than linear television. Media Dynamics reports for the 2024 TV upfronts ad dollars allocated to streaming video reached $11.1 billion, a 35% increase from 2023. Conversely, upfront ad commitments for broadcast TV and cable TV declined by -3.5% and -4.8% respectively. The ad dollars for both were below $10 billion. A study from Ampere Analysis had forecast in third quarter 2024, revenue from streaming video would be outpacing pay television for the first time. Furthermore, by 2028, the value of pay TV will be half the value it had been when it had peaked in 2017. Another strategy helping to build revenue is bundling, allowing consumers to sample new streaming services at a discounted price. The most familiar is the Disney bundle which combines Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, at a cost savings of over 40% when compared to buying the three services separately. Also, Comcast launched StreamSaver in May, a bundle available to Xfinity subscribers only. StreamSaver bundles Netflix Standard with ads, Peacock Premium with ads and Apple TV+ at a monthly fee of $15. In July. Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery launched a bundling package of Disney+, Hulu and Max available to new and existing subscribers. The ad supported bundle costs $17 monthly with an ad-free tier costing $30. Last August a streaming sports bundle from Disney, Fox and Warner Bros Discovery called Venu was temporarily placed on hold by a U.S. District Court. The court sided with Fubo, a smaller streaming service that had filed an antitrust suit claiming the bundle would put them out of business. Venu is appealing the decision. There are also a number of promotions involving streaming providers such as Verizon’s myPlan and Walmart Plus among others. With many streaming users already subscribing to at least one of services being offered it can minimize the desired impact of bundling. Another trend has been a cutback in the amount of scripted content. With the streaming wars subsided after last year’s Hollywood strikes, streaming providers have opted for cutting back on costly original scripted programming. In the pre-strike year of 2022, there were about 600 original and scripted programs, which industry analysts conclude will be the high-water mark. Also, in a first, in 2023, the number of series released on streaming platforms had dropped. What has increased however, has been live streaming sports. S&P Global Market Intelligence projects U.S. sports rights cost $30 billion across linear television and streaming. The figure could grow to $35 billion by 2027. Driving the increase has been streaming driven by the deep pocketed Amazon, Apple and, more recently, Netflix and Alphabet. Amazon has been streaming NFL Thursday Night Football for three seasons and has added NASCAR. Starting with the 2025-26 season Amazon will be streaming NBA and WNBA games outbidding Warner Bros Discovery. Apple TV+ has been streaming a package of MLB games on Friday nights and MLS games. Alphabet’s YouTube has been streaming out-of-market NFL games with Sunday Ticket. Also, Netflix will be streaming two NFL games on Christmas Day. Over the summer Peacock streamed over 5,000 hours of the Paris Olympics averaging over four million viewers each day. According to Antenna, in its first week of Olympics, Peacock added 2.8 million new subscribers. Last January, Peacock live streamed an early-round NFL playoff game. For the game, Peacock added three million new subscribers, 71% of whom were still using the service two months later. (Prime Video will be streaming the NFL game this January.) Peacock will also be live streaming NBA games starting in 2025-26 and WNBA games beginning in 2026. Although revenue losses in their streaming units are abating, several media companies are continuing to cut costs. Paramount Global recently announced more layoffs reducing U.S. employees by 15% (2,000 employees), resulting in a savings of about $500 million. As part of the cutbacks will be the closing of Paramount TV Studios. Earlier in the year, Paramount had laid off another 800 employees. In July Paramount Global announced a merger with David Ellison’s Skydance in a $8 billion deal. Also, to cut costs, in September, Disney announced cutbacks impacting 300 employees across several divisions. In another cost-cutting maneuver Warner Bros. Discovery in July announced another round of layoffs impacting about 1,000 employees in the production, business affairs and finance units. Earlier in the month CNN laid off about 100 workers.

HSBC updated its financial outlook for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (2330:TT) (NYSE: TSM), raising the price target to NT$1,535.00 from the previous NT$1,410.00. The firm has kept its Buy rating on the stock. This adjustment comes after TSMC reported robust sales figures for the third quarter of 2024, which surpassed their own revenue projections as well as market estimates. TSMC's third-quarter revenue reached TWD760 billion, marking a 13% increase from the previous quarter and exceeding the company's forecasted range of TWD728-754 billion. The reported revenue was also consistent with the projections made by HSBC and other analysts, which stood at TWD743 billion and TWD749 billion, respectively. The success is attributed to the strong performance of TSMC's advanced nodes, particularly as the 3nm technology continues to gain traction. The semiconductor giant is expected to achieve a gross margin of 55.5% for the third quarter, according to the analyst. This figure not only surpasses the consensus estimate of 54.7% but also sits at the upper end of TSMC's own guidance range of 53.5% to 55.5%. The precise details regarding the company's financial performance will be further clarified during TSMC's third-quarter earnings call, which is scheduled for October 17, 2024.

Lecia Landis/Dotdash Meredith Whether it's bacon, sugar, or even bananas, we've seen plenty of grocery prices steadily increasing over the last few years, thanks to inflation. Even Costco saw a price hike on its memberships for the first time in seven years. So, when the wholesale retailer recently shared its fourth quarter earnings for 2024, it was surprising to hear they were cutting prices on some of its popular Kirkland Signature items. Costco recently made packaging changes to its Kirkland Signature laundry detergent. By switching its packaging from a rigid plastic tub to a pouch, the company reduced plastic use by 80%, allowing the company to pass along the savings to its customers. In addition to that, the company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip, shared that the Kirkland Signature Boneless Chicken Tenders saw a price decrease of about 13% per pound, driving a 21% increase in sales. These cost-saving measures allowed Costco to now lower prices across its private-label brand. According to the call, we can expect price cuts for the following items: Keep in mind that these are not temporary discounted prices, but the new permanent prices of these items. For the best Costco sales each month, keep an eye out for our monthly Costco Best Grocery Deals feature, like this month's best grocery deals, according to our editors.

Title: Next-gen weight loss drugs will have fewer side effects than Ozempic, pharma CEO says

Time Published: 2024-10-11T14:38:00Z

Zealand Pharma CEO Adam Steensberg said Friday that the company is working on a next-generation weight loss drug that’s designed to work differently from those currently on the market and with the potential for fewer side effects. “Our focus is really what’s needed in the 2030s, and it’s really about establishing, you can say, the next-generation molecules that are not based on GLP-1s,” Steensberg told CNBC during an interview Friday. GLP-1s are a class of diabetes and obesity medications that mimic a hormone that regulates blood sugar and suppresses appetite. Demand for these medications have turned Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), the producer of Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the largest pharma companies in the world. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for GLP-1s will reach $105 billion by 2030. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know With so much money at stake, several companies — including Zealand — are racing to disrupt the weight loss drug duopoly dominated by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Zealand’s leading candidate, petrelintide, which Steensberg refers to as the company’s “crown jewel,” works differently from Ozempic and other GLP-1 drugs because it does not mimic that same hormone (GLP-1, or glucagon-like peptide-1). Instead, petrelintide is long-acting amylin analog. It works by mimicking a hormone that is co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas that increases satiety. Zealand said in June that patients taking a high dose of petrelintide over 16 weeks lost an average of 8.6% of their weight. For comparison, a clinical trial of Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy found that it helped users lose about 15% of their body weight over 68 weeks. Zealand is pitching petrelintide as an alternative for patients who can’t tolerate GLP-1 treatments, which can include side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. According to Zealand, there were no serious or severe adverse events during the study, and only one out of 48 participants dropped out of the trial due to side effects. “We have a very strong feeling that this could become a foundational therapy in the future — something that provides the weight loss that patients are looking for but with the potential for a better tolerability profile,” Steensberg told CNBC.

Intel INTC shares have largely been disappointing in 2024, unable to fully join the semiconductor trade and down more than 50%. Quarterly results have added fuel to the fire sale, with the stock unable to find any meaningful traction post-earnings. Below is a chart illustrating the YTD performance of Intel shares relative to the S&P 500, with its quarterly releases illustrated by the circled arrows. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Given the steep decline from highs, could it finally be time to go on the offensive and pick up some shares? Let’s take a closer look. Currently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish earnings estimate revisions from analysts. Expectations for its current fiscal year have been notably negative, with the $0.27 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down 85% over the last year. The negative revisions, caused by unfavorable quarterly results, bode poorly for near-term share performance. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Still, it’s worth noting that CEO Pat Gelsinger remains confident, buying 12.5k shares at a total transaction value of roughly $250k in early August following the latest quarterly print. He noted that second-half trends are more challenging than anticipated but still expects the company to restrengthen its position in the market. Cost-cutting measures have also been a huge focus for the company over recent periods after margin pressures, as we can see in the chart below. In fact, Intel announced a $10 billion cost-savings target earlier in August. Please note that the chart below is on a trailing twelve-month basis. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Investors should stay on the sidelines until positive earnings estimate revisions roll in, which would signal a meaningful change in sentiment. Earnings expectations for its upcoming release expected on October 24th have already been slashed, with the company now expected to post a loss of -$0.03 per share. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. It’s worth noting that INTC shares have been red-hot over the last month, gaining nearly 20%. While the positive price action has been inspiring, the bulk of the move has likely been fueled by a short squeeze following rumors of buyouts. For those seeking semiconductor exposure, there are many more positive stories, a list that obviously includes beloved AI-favorite Nvidia NVDA. Nvidia currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook shifting higher across the board following unbelievable quarterly results. And concerning the top line, Nvidia’s sales are forecasted to more than double in its current fiscal year.

Title: Buffett Dumps More Bank of America Stock, No Longer Has To Report Moves Promptly

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) won't have to report its transactions in Bank of America (BAC) stock promptly anymore. That's because Buffett continued his recent selloff of Berkshire's holdings in the bank, and no longer has a 10% stake, the level required to give timely updates on investments. In a securities filing, Berkshire said it had sold about 9.5 million shares of BofA over Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at an average price of approximately $40, netting some $380 million. Following the sale, Berkshire owns 775 million BofA shares. Berkshire began dumping the bank's stock in mid-July, and last month shed another 5.8 million shares. Asked about that then, BofA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Moynihan called Buffett "a great shareholder," and explained that he didn't know why Buffett was selling, but wasn't worried. "Life will go on," he added. The news didn't hurt Bank of America shares, which rose 5% Friday morning along with other bank stocks, and are up about 25% year-to-date. TradingView

Nvidia stock is poised for more gains as its GPU chip business continues to see surging demand. That's according to Morgan Stanley, which hosted meetings with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress, and other members of the chip maker's management team for three days in New York City this week. The key takeaway is that "every indication from management is that we are still early in a long term AI investment cycle," Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said. The bank reiterated its "Overweight" and "Top Pick" ratings and $150 price target, representing potential upside of 12% from current levels. Moore said Nvidia's production ramp of its next-generation Blackwell GPU chip is "progressing on schedule," adding that the product is sold out for the next 12 months. "Any new Blackwell orders now that aren't already in queue will be shipped late next year, as they are booked out 12 months, which continues to drive strong short term demand for Hopper which will still be a major factor through the year," Moore explained. Hopper is Nvidia's previous generation of AI-enabled GPU chips, which are being sold in clusters to cloud "hyperscalers" like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. And Nvidia has a new "element" to its story, according to Moore, which is the view that inference computing "is starting to solve much more complex problems which will require a much richer mix of hardware." That should be a boon for Nvidia's GPU chip product set, according to the note. "The longer term vision is that deep thinking will allow every company in the world to hire large numbers of "digital AI employees" that can execute challenging tasks," Moore said. He added: "The notion that a more thoughtful, task oriented inference would cause an exponential jump in inference complexity strikes us an important new avenue for growth, and another clear area where NVIDIA's full stack approach to solving these problems adds to the company's considerable lead." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made it clear to Morgan Stanley that the company expects to see meaningful growth in 2025 that spills over into 2026, "though he did not quantify," Moore said. Nvidia's shares have increased since the start of October, rising about 10%. Nvidia stock is up 172% since the start of this year. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to

The S&P 500 is on track for a muted open and its fifth consecutive winning week despite a slight decline Thursday. The producer price index, a measure of wholesale inflation, came in below expectations for September. A day earlier, consumer inflation data was hotter than expected. With earnings season kicking off, investors should focus more on corporate results than every single economic report. 2. Tesla skeptics are everywhere after the electric vehicle maker's hyped-up robotaxi event was short on details. Shares were down nearly 7%. CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will start building the self-driving taxis, dubbed Cybercab, before 2027 and would cost less than $30,000. But historically he has been too optimistic with these timelines. 3. BlackRock reports a total blowout quarter, with earnings per share of $11.46 well ahead of the $10.33 estimate. Revenues of $5.2 billion also beat. Inflows were insanely strong, representing 8% organic asset growth. The stock is on my shopping list for the CNBC Investing Club. 4. Wells Fargo, one of two financials we currently own for the Club, reported earnings of $1.52 a share on revenues of $20.37 billion. Both were weaker year over year, but EPS was a big beat. Shares added more than 3%. Non-interest income rose 12% on annual basis in the quarter and credit discipline was strong. Also Friday, JPMorgan topped profit and revenue estimates. 5. Domino's offers cheaper pizza, and it is catching on. The "Emergency Pizza" promo is back. Really drawn to the stock down here, even with a number of analysts lowering their price targets after the company's third-quarter earnings report Thursday. Domino's trimmed full-year sales and income growth guidance, citing the economic environment. 6. Advanced Micro Devices' pullback Thursday on its AI event looked like an opportunity. AMD was steady on Friday. Was the Club stock hurt by fact that Amazon Web Services wasn't there? Melius Research suggests that might be it. The rest of the big players were included: Microsoft, Oracle, OpenAI and Meta. We own Microsoft and Meta for the Club. 7. Goldman Sachs upped its price target on Nvidia to $150 a share from $135 and kept its buy rating on the stock. Toshiya Hari, a noted analyst, told clients that after meeting with CEO Jensen Huang and other execs, he has a better appreciation of Nvidia's competitive moat. On Thursday, Morgan Stanley reiterated Nvidia as a top pick. Nvidia is way ahead of everyone else. 8. Johnson & Johnson landed a huge win by forum shopping. A judge ruled that its subsidiary's third try at resolving tens of thousands of talc cases can stay in bankruptcy court in Texas. There is now a path out of this nightmare. Worth a look for risk-takers. 9. Barclays raised its price target on ServiceNow to $980 a share from $890, implying just a few percentage points of upside. Still, analysts kept their buy-equivalent overweight rating on the stock. Analysts said their supplier checks ticked down, making it tough to get very excited about the software earnings season. Did ServiceNow's business tick down though? I doubt it. 10. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway continued its sales of Bank of America stock this week. The latest trims brought Berkshire's stake in the bank below 10%, which means it will not have to report its sales within two business days to comply with U.S. securities law. Bank of America reports earnings Tuesday. Sign up for my Top 10 Morning Thoughts on the Market email newsletter for free (See here for a full list of the stocks at Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) are currently competing for a seat at an elite table: The exclusive trillion-dollar club. Taiwan Semiconductor’s market cap first crossed the trillion-dollar threshold in July. It has since contracted to roughly $820 billion — a stone’s throw away from Broadcom’s $867 billion. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are among the club’s current members after their market caps exceeded a trillion dollars, fueled by AI advancements. Don’t Miss: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today. With TSM and Broadcom both driving critical innovations in AI semiconductors, we ask: Which company’s market cap will attain nine zeros next? Taiwan Semiconductor stands as the world's largest contract chipmaker, leading the market with its 3nm and 5nm technology. These chips are integral for AI workloads, fueling AI giants like Nvidia and Apple. This has propelled TSM's stock by over 83.3% year-to-date and 105.39% in the past year. Analysts from Needham and Susquehanna maintain Overweight ratings, with an average price target of $236.67, implying 27.15% upside. A price at that level would push TSM's market cap to over $1.23 trillion, positioning it to re-join the trillion-dollar club. Technically, TSMC is also in a bullish trend with buying pressure across its eight, 20, 50 and 200-day moving averages, all signaling continued upward momentum. TSM’s stock currently trades at $186.33, supported by a simple moving average, or SMA, (50-day) of $170.55 and a SMA (200-day) of $149.54, indicating positive technical indicators.

Its stock is up 69.28% year-to-date and 114.05% in the past year. Despite bullish ratings, its projected upside falls short of TSM. Analysts from Cantor Fitzgerald, Truist Securities, and UBS see AVGO reaching $200, implying an 8.80% upside, which would push its market cap to $934 billion. Technically, Broadcom is also trending positively, with its current price of $184.40 supported by moving averages, such as its 50-day SMA of $161.82 and 200-day SMA of $142.55. However, it still lags behind TSM's stronger growth trajectory. While both stocks are positioned to benefit from AI, TSMC has the edge, with superior technical indicators and greater market cap potential. With an imminent leap toward $1.23 trillion in market cap if it meets analysts’ upside potential, TSM appears more likely to reach the trillion-dollar club before Broadcom.

The new agreement builds on the long-standing collaboration between the two organizations, accelerating the adoption of leading cybersecurity capabilities and helping clients realize the benefits of platformization. Many organizations struggle to manage an increasing number of cybersecurity products to secure their business. This can create a heterogeneous environment that may increase operational complexity and difficulty to achieve essential security outcomes. Platformization, the shift to an integrated platform as opposed to incompatible point solutions, helps reduce the boundaries of these disparate solutions to help organizations enhance security posture while driving operational efficiencies. Embracing this, Deloitte has consolidated multiple point solutions by adopting Palo Alto Networks Cloud and Network Security platforms. Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZS), the leader in cloud security, recently announced that the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange™ cloud security platform has surpassed half a trillion daily transactions which is nearly 60 times greater than the total number of Google searches per day. This milestone underscores the unparalleled scalability, resilience, and trust customers have placed in the Zscaler platform, which enables organizations to secure users and applications, simplify operations, and advance their business. By extracting security signals from the half a trillion daily transactions and analyzing them with advanced AI models in real-time, Zscaler has the ability to gain a comprehensive understanding of the evolving threat landscape. This advancement delivers customers superior threat detection, prevention, and response capabilities. The Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange is the world’s largest security cloud that delivers comprehensive security for users, devices, workloads and applications. The platform is built on the principle of least-privileged access to establish trust based on user identity and context—including location, device, application, and content—and then creates secure, direct user-to-app, app-to-app, and machine-to-machine connections. Zscaler services 8,600+ customers and 47+ million users, processing over half a trillion daily transactions and health performance and security metrics. Building a cloud of this magnitude and capacity takes deep experience and investment across four key areas: Scale, Resilience, Performance, and Zero Trust Connectivity. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR), a leading builder of artificial intelligence systems, and APA Corporation (APA), a leading oil and gas company, recently announced a multi-year, multi-million-dollar extension to their enterprise agreement originally signed in 2021. The agreement builds on the work deployed across APA’s global portfolio over the past three years and introduces new artificial intelligence capabilities with Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) software. Over the past three years, Palantir has partnered with APA to deploy the software across use-cases as varied as operational planning, supply chain management, maintenance planning, production optimization, and contract management.

Title: How To Earn $500 A Month From Bank of America Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earn-500-month-bank-america-124418470.html
Time Published: 2024-10-11T12:44:18Z
Full Content:
Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) currently offers an annual dividend yield of 2.6%. That’s a quarterly dividend amount of 26 cents per share ($1.04 a year). To earn $500 monthly from the Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm, start with a yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Bank of America's $1.04 dividend: $6,000 / $1.04 = 5,769 shares So, an investor would need to own approximately $230,587 worth of Bank of America, or 5,769 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.04 = 1,154 shares, or $46,125 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). View more earnings on BAC Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. Price Action: Shares of Bank of America fell by 0.6% to close at $39.97 on Thursday.

Title: Here is what analysts had to say after AMD's AI event

Investing.com -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) announced on Thursday that it will begin mass production of its new MI325X AI chip in Q4, as it looks to expand its footprint in a market dominated by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). At an event in San Francisco, CEO Lisa Su said AMD's next-generation MI350 chips will launch in the second half of 2025, offering more memory and a new architecture designed to significantly boost performance compared to the MI300X and MI250X models. Despite the announcements aligning with previous disclosures, AMD shares dropped 4% as investors reacted to the lack of major cloud-computing customers. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares rose 1.6%, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell 1%. AMD confirmed that vendors, including Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), will start shipping the MI325X AI chip in early 2025. The chip uses the same architecture as the MI300X but introduces a new memory type to accelerate AI computations. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker aims to challenge Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture with the MI325X. In addition to the AI chips, AMD revealed new networking chips for data centers and three new laptop processors based on the Zen 5 architecture, optimized for AI tasks. The laptop chips will support Microsoft’s Copilot+ software. Su also stated that AMD will continue to rely on Taiwan’s TSMC for advanced chip manufacturing. Bernstein: “The stock sold off during and following the event in a typical sell-the-news response, perhaps understandable given some modest excitement into the day, lack of huge surprises, and MI325X performance specs that we believe were likely somewhat disappointing relative to NVIDIA’s impending Blackwell launch. While we don’t want to minimize things we didn’t really hear anything to suggest we should anticipate substantial upside to current expectations, and would rather own NVDA at this point in front of Blackwell.” Deutsche Bank: “We view the event as a successful continuation of AMD's impressive execution in delivering high-quality Data Center innovations. The increase in its Accelerator TAM from $400b in 2027 to $500b in 2028 suggests continued confidence in the strong growth and share gain opportunities in an important market.” “Overall, we continue to expect AMD's Data Center segment to be a strong growth driver in 2025 via both share gains in CPUs and the potential for a near doubling of Instinct revenue.” Bank of America: “New MI325X performance generally remains a full year behind NVDA’s latest Blackwell, with no near-term catalyst to change the dynamic. However, we highlight AMD’s multi-vector growth opportunities across data center CPUs and GPUs remain unchanged, with the current 5-7% AI accelerator share consensus outlook presenting a minimum $25bn+ opportunity by CY28E, and a bull-case scenario of 10% AI share over the long-term still on the table, given continued hardware, software stack, and networking improvements.” Truist Securities: “We see this as a product evolution rather than a revolution, which reinforced our longer-term concerns with the stock:(1) we see AMD's position in AI as likely confined vs. NVDA's (Buy) full-stack semis/hardware/software/services solutions, and (2) we expect the X86 market will slowly come under pressure from new CPU competitors. No change to our estimates or $156 PT. Hold.” Morgan Stanley: “AMD launched the new Zen 5 server architecture, the mid-life kicker for MI300, and previewed the MI350. The bull case that MI350 lands them in a leadership position is very compelling, but in the interim MI300 seems likely to drive less upside than we see elsewhere in AI.”

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares are rising in premarket trading after its results beat estimates; investors are watching wholesale inflation numbers following yesterday's CPI report; Tesla (TSLA) shares are sinking after unveiling its "Cybercab"; Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) reduces its stake in Bank of America (BAC) to below 10%; and shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are rebounding slightly after falling yesterday following an artificial intelligence (AI) event. Here's what investors need to know today. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are rising about 1.5% in premarket trading after the world's largest bank by market cap reported earnings per share (EPS) of $4.37 on revenue of $42.65 billion, above consensus estimates of analysts compiled by Visible Alpha of $3.97 and $40.85 billion, respectively. JPMorgan shares have gained more than 25% this year. After yesterday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that inflation isn't falling as fast as some economists expected, investors will be closely watching another data point with today's 8:30 a.m. ET release of the wholesale-focused Producer Price Index (PPI). Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires projected that prices at the wholesale level will have increased by 0.1% in September from the prior month, down from a 0.2% rise in August. Tesla (TSLA) shares are dropping 6% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle maker unveiled several new products at an event yesterday, including its highly anticipated "Cybercab" robotaxi. Tesla also showed off a larger version of the autonomous vehicle called a "Robovan," as well as its Optimus humanoid robot. Tesla Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk said that the Cybercab would cost about $30,000 and be in production by 2026. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) continues to reduce its stake in Bank of America (BAC). According to a Thursday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett sold more than 9.5 million shares of the bank's stock. The move lowers Berkshire's stake in Bank of America to less than 10%, meaning it will face fewer reporting requirements from the SEC. Shares of Bank of America are up about 2% in premarket trading. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are rebounding by about 1% in premarket trading after they fell about 4% in the prior session following an event to show off the chipmaker's next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. At the event, AMD unveiled its fifth-generation EPYC server processor, as well as its Instinct MI300X series Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) chip and other technology. The lineup initially failed to excite investors who are eager to see the company take on Nvidia (NVDA).

Title: Tourmaline Bio to present research at Cardiometabolic Congress

Time Published: 2024-10-11T11:41:01Z

NEW YORK - Tourmaline Bio, Inc. (NASDAQ: TRML), a biotechnology firm specializing in immune and inflammatory diseases, announced today its plans to present two research posters at the 19th Annual Cardiometabolic Health Congress in Boston, MA, slated for October 17-19, 2024. The presentations will explore the role of IL-6 inhibition in cardiovascular risk and the use of high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein testing in preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The first poster, authored by a team from Tourmaline and Atropos Health, will discuss the utilization of high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein testing in primary and secondary ASCVD prevention. The second poster, a collaborative effort between Tourmaline and Wake Forest University School of Medicine, will present a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effect of IL-6 inhibition on Lipoprotein(a) levels, an emerging marker of cardiovascular risk. Tourmaline's lead asset, pacibekitug (TOUR006), is a long-acting, fully-human anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody, which the company believes has best-in-class potential due to its long half-life, low immunogenicity, and high binding affinity to IL-6. Pacibekitug has undergone trials involving approximately 450 participants, including those with autoimmune disorders. The company is developing pacibekitug for thyroid eye disease (TED) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), with other diseases being considered for its application. These presentations signify Tourmaline's ongoing commitment to addressing inflammatory cardiovascular risk and furthering the understanding of IL-6's role in cardiometabolic health. The research could potentially contribute to the development of more targeted therapies for patients with immune and inflammatory diseases. The findings are based on a press release statement from Tourmaline Bio, Inc., and further details on the congress and the research can be found at the Cardiometabolic Health Congress website. Tourmaline Bio continues to focus on advancing its research and development efforts in the field of biotechnology, aiming to bring new, impactful treatments to the market. In other recent news, Tourmaline Bio has seen a flurry of activity with several key developments. The company announced the resignation of its Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Yung Chyung, who is leaving to pursue another opportunity. Meanwhile, Guggenheim reaffirmed its Buy rating on the company, undeterred by the departure of the CMO. Tourmaline Bio has also formed a Cardiovascular Scientific Advisory Board (CV SAB) to provide strategic guidance for its cardiovascular drug, pacibekitug, expected to reach Phase 3 clinical trial readiness in 2025. The company has also initiated the TRANQUILITY Phase 2 clinical trial for pacibekitug, with results anticipated in 2025. In addition to these clinical advancements, Tourmaline Bio promoted Ryan Robinson to the role of Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. The company also made significant amendments to its bylaws and changed its fiscal year, aimed at streamlining governance and shareholder engagement processes. Analyst firms Truist Securities and Piper Sandler have maintained their positive ratings for Tourmaline Bio, expressing confidence in the potential of pacibekitug. These recent developments reflect Tourmaline Bio's commitment to progress and innovation in the biotechnology sector. Tourmaline Bio's ambitious research presentations at the upcoming Cardiometabolic Health Congress align with the company's strong financial performance and market position. According to InvestingPro data, Tourmaline Bio has experienced a remarkable 152.11% price total return over the past year, indicating significant investor confidence in the company's potential. Despite the company's impressive stock performance, InvestingPro Tips reveal that Tourmaline Bio is not currently profitable and is expected to face a drop in net income this year. This suggests that the company is in a growth phase, investing heavily in research and development, which is typical for biotechnology firms focused on innovative treatments. Interestingly, an InvestingPro Tip highlights that Tourmaline Bio holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet. This strong liquidity position could provide the company with the financial flexibility needed to continue its research initiatives and potentially bring its promising IL-6 inhibitor, pacibekitug, to market. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Tourmaline Bio, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: Spotify doubles down on remote work policy, Layoffs and their longer term business impacts

Plus, Home Depot requires corporate staff to work in retail stores. Plus, Home Depot requires corporate staff to work in retail stores. Greetings, comms pros! Let’s take a look at a few news stories from the past week and see what we can learn from them. 1. Spotify commits to ‘work anywhere’ policy amid RTO push at other companies As other companies like Amazon work to bring their employees back to their desks, Spotify is pushing in the other direction and reaffirming its commitment to allowing employees to work wherever they choose. According to Raconteur: “You can’t spend a lot of time hiring grown-ups and then treat them like children,” says Katarina Berg, Spotify’s CHRO. While she says she understands why some companies have returned to the office, “they are going back to what they know”, Berg is yet to find a reason to enforce a mandate for Spotify’s employees. “We are a business that’s been digital from birth, so why shouldn’t we give our people flexibility and freedom?” she says. “Work is not a place you come to, it’s something you do.” Berg’s willingness to back her organization’s employees so publicly in the context of Spotify’s history of allowing employees to work remotely is refreshing at a time when other companies scramble to justify reasons to get people back to their desks. Speaking openly about the autonomy the company gives them in allowing them to make their own choices is a lesson in employee experience, employer trust, and employer branding that other companies can learn. Your employees are your greatest asset and give your company its identity. Treat them respectfully and like the talented professionals they are, and it’ll be a lot easier to recruit and retain people. [RELATED: Make sure your team is up to date on the latest skills, strategies and practices. Learn more about Ragan Training.] 2. Report: Layoffs impact the business beyond job cuts Nobody likes to talk about layoffs. But what about the longer-term impacts they create for companies that they happen to? According to a study by Harvard Business Review, organizations that had “committed” employees felt layoffs even harder than those with less loyal employees. Additionally, intangibles like pride, future motivation, and recommendations to others outside the company each dropped by a factor of more than 10% following a layoff. Layoffs do a lot more than just let go of valued colleagues. They serve as a reset point for organizations, and if they’re not carefully planned, companies risk poisoning their cultural wells. By running all layoff comms through a lens of empathy and commitment to mission and values, these impacts can be lessened, even if there is some inevitable sour sentiment. 3. Home Depot requires corporate employees to work retail shifts Deeper interaction by corporate employees with front-facing workers can help create a deeper appreciation for the culture and function of the business. Home Depot is taking this a step further, and getting its desk workers to don orange aprons several times a year. The policy mandates corporate employees to spend one full shift in stores quarterly to better gain an appreciation for the business and culture, Home Depot said in a memo obtained by Bloomberg. According to Bloomberg: “We need to stay connected to the core of our business, so we can truly understand the challenges and opportunities our store associates face every day,” Chief Executive Officer Ted Decker said in the memo introducing the program. A company spokesperson said it’s been the company’s longstanding practice to ask staff to spend time in stores, with this new program being its latest initiative. What better way for communicators to learn about who they’re messaging with and to than spending a day in the shoes of front-facing workers? Comms pros do their best work when they understand the culture and values of a company inside and out. Tying on the ubiquitous Home Depot apron and learning firsthand about the challenges and opportunities of your frontline audience is a great way to achieve that goal, especially with the blessing of leadership. 4.

Title: While private companies own 41% of Supermax Corporation Berhad (KLSE:SUPERMX), retail investors are its largest shareholders with 46% ownership
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/while-private-companies-own-41-041046645.html

Supermax Corporation Berhad's significant retail investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public The top 7 shareholders own 50% of the company Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business To get a sense of who is truly in control of Supermax Corporation Berhad (KLSE:SUPERMX), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 46% to be precise, is retail investors. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Meanwhile, private companies make up 41% of the company’s shareholders. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Supermax Corporation Berhad, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Supermax Corporation Berhad Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Supermax Corporation Berhad. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Supermax Corporation Berhad's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Supermax Corporation Berhad. The company's largest shareholder is Supermax Holdings Sdn Bhd, with ownership of 41%. With 3.0% and 2.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, Hong Leong Asset Management Bhd. and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. We did some more digging and found that 7 of the top shareholders account for roughly 50% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Supermax Corporation Berhad. It has a market capitalization of just RM2.2b, and insiders have RM89m worth of shares, in their own names. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 46% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 41%, of the company's shares. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. I always like to check for a history of revenue growth.

Title: AMD Price Levels to Watch as Stock Tumbles After AI Chip Unveiling

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 4% on Thursday as the chipmaker's new AI lineup failed to excite investors who are eager to see the company take on Nvidia (NVDA). AMD's next-generation products, unveiled at its Advancing AI event today, come as demand for AI chips soars and AMD aims to expand its market share. Analysts said investors may have been looking for clearer signs of competition with AI investor darling Nvidia, an outlook boost, or a new customer announcement. AMD shares have gained 11% year-to-date (YTD) through Thursday’s close, trailing the S&P 500’s return by about half over the same period. The stock has lagged amid concerns that the chipmaker has failed to capitalize on the lucrative AI infrastructure boom. Below, we break down the technicals on AMD’s chart and identify important price levels investors should watch out for. Since a bearish engulfing pattern marked AMD’s all-time high (ATH) in early March, the chipmaker’s share price as oscillated within an orderly descending channel, a chart pattern consisting of parallel downward sloping trendlines indicating lower highs and lower lows. More recently, the stock has run into selling pressure around the channel’s upper trendline, with Thursday’s drop occurring on the heaviest trading volume since the early August sell-off, pointing to conviction behind the move lower. It’s also worth noting that although the stock remains above the 200-day moving average (MA), the indicator crossed above the 50-day MA in August to form a death cross—a chart signal predicting lower prices. Let’s take a look at three key lower price levels that could come into play if the chipmaker’s stock continues to undergo a retracement, and also use the chart to forecast an upside price target. The first area to eye sits around $162, not far below Thursday's closing price of $164.18. This is a location where the shares could attract buying interest near the 200-day MA and a trendline connecting a range of similar trading levels on the chart between February and October. If bulls fail to hold this level, the stock could fall to the $142 area, where it may find support from a horizontal line linking a period of consolidation in December last year with the prominent May trough. A deeper correction could see the shares revisit lower support around $122, a location on the chart where investors could look for buying opportunities near the channel’s lower trendline, which closely aligns with the early-August low and late-November 2023 peak. To forecast an upside price target above the descending channel, we can use the measuring principle. This chart technique works by calculating the distance between the pattern’s two trendlines and projecting that amount from the channel’s top trendline. In other words, we add $50 to $170, which forecasts an upside target of $220, slightly below the stock’s record high of $227.30.

Title: Nvidia, Mag 7 Flash Warning Signs For Stocks

The Fed surprised the market with an aggressive 50 bps cut recently, which has pushed the S&P 500 back to new all-time highs. However, not all markets are celebrating this move. Bond yields and mortgage rates, for example, have been in an uptrend since this decision, which is not normal to see at the onset of a rate cutting cycle. Also, the bull market leaders – the Mag 7 and AI focused semiconductors – are making a series of lower highs, not confirming this move in the S&P 500. This divergence between the market leaders and the broad market has been the consistent theme of the I/O Fund’s broad market reports in 2024. More times than not, the bull market leaders will lead on the way up, as well on the way down. So, when my firm sees the primary beneficiaries of a bull market start to make lower highs while the broad market makes higher highs, it tends to be a warning. Nvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang, left, talks about artifical intelligence with Meta's ... [+] chief Mark Zuckerberg at SIGGRAPH 2024, the premier conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques, Monday, July 29, 2024, in the Colorado Convention Center in downtown Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) In this report, my team will address the risks brewing in the market. The strange behavior in the bond market could be signaling that the FOMC has made a policy error. This coupled with key tech stocks trending lower against the S&P 500’s advance, has my firm cautious for the time being. In 2023 we saw these market leaders trending higher with the broad market. This was a powerful trend that lasted into late 2023. As a result, the collective Mag 7 returned around 90% in 2023 vs. the S&P 500 returning 24%. However, this trend is not continuing into 2024, as we are beginning to see cracks in market leadership. This year, the Mag 7 are up ~30% compared to the S&P 500’s ~20%. Though this year has been excellent for investors, it’s concerning the relative strength between the bull market leaders and the broad market is narrowing, which has been a constant theme in our broad market analysis throughout all of 2024. “When the cycle leaders start to underperform, it tends to mark the start of a trend change. The FAANGs have been the undoubted leaders of this bull run, and we are now seeing them start to trend lower against the indexes. More times than not, the leaders on the way up, tend to be the leaders on the way down.” More importantly, the Mag 7 is making a lower high, while the S&P 500 makes a higher high. In other words, the bull market leaders are not confirming this push higher in the broad market. This is a rare pattern that has only shown up one other time in this bull market – July of 2023, just before we saw an almost 11% correction in the broad market. A rare pattern observed in the bull market, similar to July 2023, preceding an 11% correction in the ... [+] broad market. This divergence is not only happening with the Mag 7, but it’s also happening with the most important sub-sector within tech due to AI – semiconductors. Since the current bull market began on October 13th of 2022, the Mag 7 has returned over 102% vs. the S&P 500’s 61%. During the same period, semiconductors have returned over 174%. The leading stock, Nvidia, is up over 967% over the same period. So, while the Mag 7 are the popular market leaders, the true market leaders of the current bull cycle are semiconductors, and specifically, Nvidia. This is a trend that the I/O Fund positioned for in 2022, making NVDA our largest position, as we rotated out of cloud stocks and into AI. Performance of the Mag 7, S&P 500, and semiconductors since October 13, 2022: The Mag 7 returned ... [+] over 102%, the S&P 500 returned 61%, and semiconductors returned over 174%, with Nvidia up over 967%. SMH has a history of leading market swings in the broad market. Since 2021, every time the S&P 500 made a new high without SMH, it preceded a period of volatility. Today’s divergence is one of the largest on record. The Semiconductor Index topped in July at $283, and is still well below this high, compared to the S&P 500 that just pushed to new a new high this week at 5796. Chart illustrating the semiconductor sub-sector’s corrective pattern, featuring a 3-wave drop since ... [+] June followed by a bounce from the August 5th low, suggesting a potential final drop targeting $190 to $165. When digging deeper into this key sub-sector, we can see that a clear corrective pattern is playing out. Since the June top, there is a clear 3 waves down. This has been followed, so far, by a symmetrical 3 wave bounce off the August 5th low. This pattern best fits a standard corrective patten. This implies that a final drop is still needed, which is targeting between $190 - $165. The advance seen today is poking above the downtrend line from the July top. However, this is happening on less volume and less momentum. Note the momentum indicator below the chart. It has given three lower highs while price provided three higher highs. This is a rare pattern that tends to precede a trend reversal. Chart depicting the current market advance above the July downtrend line, showing decreasing volume ... [+] and momentum. The momentum indicator reveals three lower highs, while the price shows three higher highs, suggesting a potential trend reversal. Nvidia topped in June at $140, and failed to make a new high in July with the rest of the Semiconductor Index. This was a warning that semis, and the broad market, were heading lower. This same relative weakness is still present today. While most semiconductors have broken out above their August high, NVDA remained below it. This week, it has moved above the August high, which appears to be the final move in this bounce which is happening on less momentum and less volume. This lines up with the I/O Fund’s game plan, which was to sell a quarter of our NVDA position in June around $129, and attempt to buy it lower in the coming months, which was discussed in detail on my recent interview. Chart illustrating NVDA’s incomplete corrective pattern, indicating potential drops below $114 and ... [+] $108, which could lead to a decline toward the $90 - $70 region, completing a multi-month correction. Like SMH, NVDA appears to be tracing an incomplete corrective pattern. A move below $114 and then $108 will signal that the stock is heading toward the $90 - $70 region, which would complete this multi-month correction. NVDA remains weaker than the broad market, as well as SMH. Considering the importance of this stock, as long as it remains below its June high, it is a warning to the current broad market advance. Some have argued that the market is taking gains in the AI leaders and spreading that money out into beaten down sectors. In other words, there is a healthy broadening out of the market, which typically exhibits strength. The narrative that supports this idea is that the FOMC just offered a surprise 50 bps rate cut into a seemingly healthy economy. The cheaper cost of borrowing should propel more economically sensitive sectors to play catch-up as the economic expansion continues. As plausible as this sounds, it’s just not showing up in data, yet. Since the Fed cut rates on September 18th, we are not seeing money flowing into your beaten down sectors that should do well if this narrative is playing out. Sectors like, transportation, small caps, retail sales, consumer discretionary and high beta are still under their 2021 highs. These are the sectors that would benefit from a soft-landing. As you can see below, aside from consumer discretionary, they are all underperforming the S&P 500. Chart illustrating the market dynamics where AI leaders are gaining, but beaten down sectors like ... [+] transportation, small caps, retail sales, consumer discretionary, and high beta are still lagging behind the S&P 500, showing no significant investment flow after the FOMC’s 50 bps rate cut. While Nvidia and Semiconductors are making a lower high, there is more money flowing into defensive and inflationary markets, like, Energy, Apple, Utilities and even the US dollar is doing better than the markets that would support the broadening out narrative. Another unusual development since the Fed cut rates is that bonds are not acting as they should at the onset of a rate cutting cycle. Historically, the relationship between long-dated bonds and the Fed cutting rates has been an inverse relationship. As the Fed cuts rates, it is usually in the face of a weakening economy. If prices are going down due to demand collapsing, then a fixed yield is desirable in that environment, meaning that we should see bonds going higher. This is not what is happening today. The day the Fed cut rates, the 10-year government bond began a sharp decline and is currently down nearly 4% from its high. This is a big move for the 10-year bond. Chart showing the 10-year government bond’s sharp decline after the Fed’s rate cut, highlighting an ... [+] unusual trend where bond prices typically rise in a weakening economy. The bond is down nearly 4% from its high. This is unusual behavior, as the above chart shows. Bonds should be going higher, not lower, based on historical comparisons. The popular narrative for this behavior in the bond market is that this is evidence that the FED accomplished a soft landing. If we were going into a slowing economy, which could lead to a deflationary event, then bonds would be catching a bid. So, the fact that we are not must mean that the economy is strong, and the economic expansion will only continue. This will then propel asset prices higher, as well as inflation, making the need for fixed yields a poor investment. As we just saw, the market is not buying this narrative, as money is not flowing into the sectors that would support this thesis. So, what could be going on? It’s important to understand that the Fed does not control the 10-year yield; this is controlled by the bond market’s expectations for future growth and inflation. The Fed’s reasoning for aggressively dropping rates on September 18th was that inflation is heading to 2% and the employment market is starting to show weakness. Since then, the ISM non-manufacturing PMI posted its hottest reading since February of 2023. Twelve out of the 18 segments of this report stated that prices are rising, not falling. Chart highlighting the ISM non-manufacturing PMI’s highest reading since February 2023, with 12 of ... [+] 18 segments reporting rising prices. Additionally, the labor market added 107,000 more jobs than expected, revising September figures up by 17,000, causing the unemployment rate to drop from 4.22% to 4.05%. This was accompanied with a labor market that is much stronger than expected. The most recent jobs report showed that the US added 107,000 more jobs than expected, while September’s report was revised higher by 17,000 jobs. This caused the unemployment rate to drop back to 4.05% from 4.22%. This is further confirmed with current mortgage rates. Everyone was expecting mortgage rates to drop with the Fed Funds Rate. However, since the cut, there has been a sharp increase in average mortgage rate from 6% to 6.32%. Current mortgage rates defy expectations, rising sharply from 6% to 6.32% following the Fed’s rate ... [+] cut, contrary to the anticipated decrease. The reason for this is because mortgage rates are not determined by the Fed. Instead, they are the result of an equation that includes the 10-year yield and the borrower’s credit score. So, the 10-year getting sold, means yields are going up. This happening on the day of the FED’s rate cut policy means the bond market is not convinced inflation is heading to 2%, which is pushing mortgage rates higher. This means that we could be getting signals that the FED made a policy error, and dropped rates too soon, as yields continue to climb in the weeks after this decision. Interesting enough, at the Grant’s Annual Fall Conference, Druckenmiller stated that his largest bet is shorting the US bond market. His reasoning is not because the Fed achieved a successful soft landing, which the consensus believes, but it is because “bipartisan fiscal recklessness is on the horizon.” In other words, the larger our deficits become, the more money will need to be borrowed to cover interest payments. As more and more debt gets created, yields will have to go up to attract more buyers, which will put pressure on fiscal budgets, and therefore creates a vicious cycle. To put this into perspective, the budget deficit for the fiscal year 2024 is going to come in around $1.9 Trillion, or 6.7% of GDP. There is no other year in US history where the budget deficient was this large outside of a major war, like WW I & WW II, or dealing with a major recession, like 2008. It is unheard of to have fiscal spending this high, in an expanding economy, with historically low unemployment. This makes you wonder what the deficit will look like in the face of a contraction. This was an issue that the market has been aware of for decades but was able to ignore due to historically low interest rates. With rates low and trending lower, this fiscal recklessness was allowed to go on. However, we are seeing for the first time in 30 years, bond yields are starting a new uptrend. Since 1981, the 10-year yield has been in a classic downtrend, making a series of lower highs. This trend made borrowing easier, as low rates made the cost of borrowing affordable. However, in 2021, yields broke this downtrend and made their first higher highs in 30 years. Today, yields are higher than they were in 2008, making the cost of borrowing higher than most investors are used to in over 20 years. Diagram illustrating the market’s awareness of excessive debt and low interest rates enabling fiscal ... [+] recklessness. Since 1981, the 10-year yield has followed a downtrend until breaking the trend in 2021, resulting in the highest borrowing costs seen in over 20 years. If this uptrend in yields continues, which looks likely, it would become problematic for inflation expectations, as well as the Fed’s ability to lower rates. It will also become problematic for the cost to service government debts, as more debt will be issued at higher rates to cover current service requirements. And, it will become problematic for stocks, specifically high beta stocks that need to borrow to fund operations, as estimates on future cash flows will have to account for a higher cost to borrow. In short, the last +20 years have built on the idea that inflation will not happen, and the FED can keep rates close to zero. The bull market pattern off the 2022 low has taken the shape of a messy diagonal pattern. This is a 5 wave pattern where the internal waves are 3 waves in all directions. It is also marked with large, overlapping swings. Note how wave 4 went into wave 1 territory – this is typical of diagonals. The 5th wave in this pattern is a blow off, and from what I can tell, we are in the final swing of this pattern. If SPX can breakout above 5825, then it can likely push into the 6000 – 6185 region. If instead, it breaks down below 5675 this will be your first indication of a potential trend change. Below 5500 and then 5115 will be the final confirmations. Chart illustrating a messy diagonal pattern in the bull market since the 2022 low, consisting of 5 ... [+] waves with overlapping swings. Key breakout points are at 5825, while downtrend confirmations are at 5675 and 5500, indicating potential trend changes. In conclusion, as the economic expansion continues, the odds of a recession remain low. However, money is not flowing into the beaten down sectors that would benefit from this reality. Instead, defensive and inflationary names are getting more flows than transportation, small caps, high beta and retail sales. The market leaders continue to make lower highs while the broad market pushes higher, and bonds are getting sold as if the FED stopped cutting rates, not started. The warning signs are high, and my firm remains defensive until these signals reverse, or the market corrects.

Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground after the latest Consumer Price Index report showed greater-than-expected price increases in September, driven by an uptick in grocery prices. In addition to weighing on household budgets, the hot inflation data could constrain the Federal Reserve as policymakers deliberate over further interest-rate cuts. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% on Thursday, while the Dow was down 0.1%. Both indexes receded from record closes posted in the previous session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also retreated, though it fared slightly better, closing with a minimal daily loss of less than 0.1%. Shares of solar panel producer First Solar (FSLR) plunged 9.3%, the most of any S&P 500 constituent, after Jefferies reduced its price target on the stock to $266 from $271. Research analysts warned of potential delays that could restrain First Solar's volumes in the current quarter and those to come. Other solar industry stocks also moved lower: Shares of solar technology firm Enphase Energy (ENPH) slipped 5.8%. Semiconductor manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) unveiled new artificial intelligence (AI) chips at its "Advancing AI 2024" event in San Francisco on Thursday. Its shares dropped 4%, with some analysts suggesting that its presentation may not have been sufficient to convince investors that its new products will be able to compete with AI chips from Nvidia (NVDA). Shares of Generac Holdings (GNRC), which provides home generators and other power solutions, fell 3.5% as Hurricane Milton moved through Florida. Thursday's downturn reversed a portion of the gains posted by the stock ahead of the storm. The day's strongest performance in the S&P 500 belonged to shares of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), which climbed 5.6% after RBC Capital included the stock on its list of top picks in the software space. Analysts believe the company is successfully moving past an incident in July when a faulty software update caused widespread IT outages around the world. Shares of fertilizer maker Mosaic Co. (MOS) gained 4.4%. Based in Tampa, Fla., Mosaic faced uncertainties about the potential impact of Hurricane Milton on its operations. The company said Thursday that it will begin to assess the impact of the storm as soon as conditions allow. Shares of Micron Technology (MU) shares added 3.9%. Although AMD's AI event may have failed to generate much investor enthusiasm, its new chips included more memory than previous products, underlining the importance of high-bandwidth memory for AI processes. Micron, which manufactures memory chips, is a partner of AMD.

WeightWatchers (WW) is trying to save its ailing business by betting on a market that threatens its very existence. The weight-loss company, previously championed by the likes of Oprah Winfrey, saw its stock spike this week after announcing that it will make copycats of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Ozempic and Wegovy weight-loss drugs. WW International (i.e. WeightWatchers) stock jumped nearly 40% Wednesday following the news, and the stock climbed an additional 23% Thursday to close at $1.96. WW is up 172% from last week. Though WeightWatchers’ core business is its dieting program, the company has attempted to get in on the booming weight-loss drug market dominated by pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). (The strategy was championed by its former CEO Sima Sistani, who recently departed the company.) WeightWatchers first attempted to secure a foothold in the weighty drug space early last year with its acquisition of Sequence, a telehealth platform specializing in weight-loss medication management. The acquisition has failed to improve the company’s revenue, which fell 14.5% in 2023 and is expected to decline another 13% this year. WeightWatchers’ announcement Tuesday that it will offer compounded GLP-1 drugs — which are cheaper and don't require insurance — is another shot at capitalizing on the market late in the game. Federal laws allow companies to sell compounded versions of drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration’s shortage list. Regulations allow the drugs to be made at FDA-registered facilities, but the compounded medications themselves are not FDA-approved. WeightWatchers will offer a compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. Here's the rub: Once the Novo Nordisk drugs are removed from the FDA’s shortage list, WeightWatchers will no longer be able to produce compounded semaglutide drugs at scale. Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's Mounjaro and Zepbound, was removed from the list last week, posing a massive problem for companies making compounded versions of the drug. “Compounding is not a sustainable long-term business model,” Barclays (BARC.L) healthcare technology and distribution analyst Stephanie Davis told Yahoo Finance. Davis is one of four Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg. Half of those analysts have Equal Weight ratings on WW, and Davis is one of the other two analysts who recommend selling the stock. Meanwhile, WeightWatchers’ expansion in the weight-loss drug space contradicts its core business. “GLP-1s are going to cannibalize the diet industry,” Davis said. WeightWatchers did not immediately respond to questions from Yahoo Finance on Thursday. To illustrate the weakness of WeightWatchers’ strategy, Davis pointed to the rapid boom and bust of Hims & Hers Health (HIMS) stock. Shares of the telehealth company surged after news that it would sell Ozempic and Wegovy copycats. The stock climbed 70% from the time of the announcement in May to a closing high of around $24.79 in mid-June. Then, when the FDA removed tirzepatide from its shortage list — a gloomy sign for sellers of compounded GLP-1s — HIMS tanked. HIMS shares dropped another 10% on Oct. 2 when the FDA published a letter citing concerns over compounded drugs — which are not reviewed for safety, effectiveness, or quality before they’re marketed. More trouble for WW? Novo Nordisk on Oct. 8 published a study that found impurities in compounded versions of its drug — raising questions about the safety and efficacy of compounded semaglutide medications in particular. Morgan Stanley's (MS) Nathan Feather, on the other hand, believes that it’s not too late for WeightWatchers to turn things around. He said WeightWatchers’ failures to successfully monetize its GLP-1 telehealth offering — something it gained through its purchase of Sequence — has been due to its clients’ lack of insurance coverage for the drugs and the company's shortcomings in the advertising space, rather than weakness in its core business. WeightWatchers’ new, cheaper compound GLP-1 offering, which doesn’t require insurance, could help overcome those issues. “Given the sudden [market] share reversal [for WW International] was primarily due to the inability to compete in ad markets rather than consumer dissatisfaction with the Clinic program, we believe the launch of compounding addresses the primary constraint to growth,” Feather said in a note to investors Tuesday. He added: “The bar for execution is high with diet season rapidly approaching” in addition to “investor concerns on the liquidity profile.” Feather maintains his Equal Weight rating on the stock, contending that WeightWatchers’ GLP-1 offering is only a temporary solution. “As GLP-1s are removed from the shortage list, this could lead to large-scale churn events if WW is unable to continue servicing clients using compounded medication,” he said.

Shares of cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) added more than 5% on Thursday, notching the S&P 500's top performance of the day, after RBC Capital named the company one of its top investment ideas in North American software for 2025. CrowdStrike drew scrutiny in mid-July when the firm's defective software update caused widespread technology outages across the world. Fallout from that incident sent CrowdStrike shares tumbling, and it's still below the levels seen after those events—but the stock has been on a path of recovery since printing a low in early August. According to analysts at RBC, the negative headlines about the midsummer software update and subsequent technological interruptions generated "short-term noise" surrounding CrowdStrike stock, but the company appears poised to emerge from the situation in a strong position. RBC believes CrowdStrike could be on track to achieve $10 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR). The company's management team recently reiterated its goal to achieve this ambitious milestone by fiscal 2031. CrowdStrike's ARR for fiscal 2024 came in at over $3.4 billion. CrowdStrike continues to face issues stemming from the July incident. When Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported lower-than-expected sales and profits in its quarterly report released Thursday, the carrier cited the negative impact of the CrowdStrike outage, which resulted in the cancellation of thousands of flights. According to Delta, the incident caused a $380 million hit to revenue in the quarter. The airline's CEO said Delta continues to seek compensation from CrowdStrike and Microsoft (MSFT) related to the outages. Following Thursday's gains, CrowdStrike shares are trading around 23% higher year-to-date but remain around 21% below the all-time highs seen this summer before the incident.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) unveiled its next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) chips at its Advancing AI event on Thursday, though shares fell after the announcements, with analysts suggesting investors may have been looking for more from the chipmaker. AMD announced its fifth-generation EPYC server processor, which CEO Lisa Su said delivers dramatically more power than its predecessor, and new Ryzen AI PRO processors for enterprise AI. The company also showed off its latest Instinct MI300X series GPU, the MI325X, with production set begin in the fourth quarter and availability for AMD's partners in the first quarter of 2025. The new products come as demand for AI chips grows, and could help AMD expand its market share. AMD said its market share for its EPYC server processors hit a new high of 34% at the end of the second quarter, and could continue to climb with its next generation of products. Analysts suggested ahead of the event that it could be a "catch-up" catalyst for AMD to expand its slice of the market, after a strong start to the year with data center sales hitting a record high in the second quarter. Su also highlighted the chipmaker's partnerships with Oracle (ORCL), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) at the event. Kevin Salvadori, Meta’s VP for infrastructure and engineering, said that the company’s work on generative AI has made use of more than 1.5 million of AMD's EPYC CPUs and utilized Instinct GPUs for projects such as developing its Llama large language model. Oracle SVP Karan Batta added that AMD's Instinct GPUs have delivered strong performance for the company, and Google Cloud VP Amin Vahdat called the demand for AI computing power "insatiable." The event did little to benefit AMD's stock price, however. Shares fell 4% Thursday to close at $164.18. Jefferies and Wedbush analysts suggested investors may have been looking for clearer signs of competition with Nvidia (NVDA), an outlook boost, or new customer announcement. UPDATE—Oct. 10, 2024: This article has been updated to include additional comments from analysts and reflect more recent share price information.

U.S. equities declined at midday, with the S&P 500 falling from its record high, as a report on consumer prices showed higher-than-expected inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq also fell. Pfizer (PFE) shares slid when two former executives released a statement supporting the current management in its battle with activist investor Starboard Value. Starboard accused people inside the company of threatening the pair. First Solar (FSLR) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 when Jefferies lowered its price target, warning that current-quarter earnings will come up short of expectations because of delays. Shares of solar power firms Enphase Energy (ENPH) and SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) dropped as well. PayPal Holdings (PYPL) shares tumbled when Bernstein downgraded the stock, saying there was no upside after recent gains. A Barclays upgrade lifted shares of CVS Health (CVS), with the analysts arguing the pharmacy chain and healthcare firm has a compelling margin recovery opportunity. CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) shares advanced when RBC Capital named the cybersecurity provider one of the top software ideas for 2025. Oil and gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was higher. The U.S. dollar gained on the euro and pound, but lost ground to the yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies dropped. TradingView

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced new artificial intelligence chips to boost its rivalry with other chipmakers, including Nvidia (NVDA). The chipmaker launched its new Instinct MI325X accelerators and Ryzen AI PRO 300 series processors along with other leading-edge computing chips on Thursday at its Advancing AI conference in San Francisco. “The data center and AI represent significant growth opportunities for AMD, and we are building strong momentum for our EPYC and AMD Instinct processors across a growing set of customers,” AMD chief executive Lisa Su said in a statement. With its new chips, AMD is “delivering leadership compute to power our customers’ most important and demanding workloads,” she added. By 2028, AMD sees the market for data center AI accelerators reaching $500 billion, Su said, adding that the chipmaker is “committed to delivering open innovation at scale through our expanded silicon, software, network and cluster-level solutions.” At Computex in June, Su announced AMD’s next-generation MI325X AI accelerator with improved “performance and memory capabilities for the most demanding AI” processing, which she said would be available in the fourth quarter. She also unveiled the Ryzen AI PRO 300 series which will be used for AI laptops, including Microsoft’s (MSFT) Copilot+ PCs. Like rival Nvidia, Su said in June that AMD has “expanded our roadmap so it’s now on an annual cadence, that means a new product family every year.” AMD expects to launch its next-generation Instinct MI350 series accelerators in the second half of 2025, the chipmaker said. Its Instinct MI400 Series accelerators are planned for 2026. The company’s Instinct MI300X accelerators were launched in December, and are used by some of the world’s leading AI models from OpenAI, Meta (META), and open-source models on Hugging Face.

Title: How Atlassian Thinks About Developing New Uses For AI

Plus: AI Pioneers And Users Get Nobel Prizes, Nvidia Becomes Second Most Valuable Company, Meta’s Smart Glasses Can Be Used To Dox Strangers, Passkeys Are Replacing Passwords More proof that AI technology should be moving past the hype phase: Two AI pioneers were recognized this week with the Nobel Prize in Physics. In the 1980s, John Hopfield developed an artificial neural network, like what exists in the brain, that uses a method for saving and recognizing patterns, providing computers with the ability to essentially connect conceptual dots, writes Forbes senior contributor Tor Constantino. Geoffrey Hinton, often referred to as the “godfather of AI,” developed the 1980s “Boltzmann machine,” which could train neural networks to “learn.” In the decades since Hopfield and Hinton first published their research, it’s become the bedrock upon which many technologists and programmers have built AI and machine learning platforms. But their selection for the Nobel Prize shocked many—and not just because their contributions have only a tenuous connection to physics. Hinton, who received the Turing Award in 2019 for his contributions to AI, actually left his job at Google last year so he could speak freely about the potential risks to humanity posed by AI systems. “It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,” Hinton told the New York Times after his resignation from the tech giant. In an interview published hours after the prize was announced in the New York Times, Hinton said he hopes it will make people take his predictions about AI’s potential harm more seriously. But fears about the technology—which is largely unregulated in the United States right now—continue to thrive. After California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill last month that would’ve placed strict restrictions on expensive AI platforms, conversation about the right sort of regulation has picked up in many sectors, writes Forbes senior contributor Joe McKendrick. After next month’s election, AI regulation may become a topic for action in legislatures across the country and in Congress. But in the meantime, AI technology is sure to advance. After all, this year’s Nobel Prize for Chemistry went to David Baker, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper for their use of AI in designing and predicting the complex structures of proteins. Thousands of companies worldwide use Atlassian’s collaboration platforms, which include Jira and Confluence, to unite teams and projects. As AI becomes more powerful, the enterprise software company is using its observations—both from its customers and its own experience—to bring the technology to its platforms. I talked to Atlassian President Anu Bharadwaj about Atlassian’s viewpoint and response to AI demand in enterprises. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang displays products at the annual Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference in March. The roller coaster ride for Nvidia stock continues, with the company surging to become the world’s second most valuable, surpassing Microsoft, on Monday. At the close of markets on Wednesday, Nvidia was worth $3.253 trillion, as its days-long rally slowed slightly. Nvidia’s stock and market capitalization has seen dramatic rises and falls in the last month and a half. After its most recent earnings report at the end of August—in which the AI processor company delivered record earnings and smashed expectations—its stock price tumbled because it didn’t project as much growth in the next quarter as some might have wanted to see. But since then, relatively small events have caused Nvidia’s stock to spike. At a Goldman Sachs conference in mid-September, CEO Jensen Huang said demand for Nvidia’s soon-to-come Blackwell processors was “so great,” leading the stock value to pop 8%. And another leap in value came last week when Huang said on a CNBC interview that demand for the new chip was “insane.” Monday started a new rally, courtesy of Super Micro Computer’s announcement that sales for its liquid cooling products alongside Nvidia’s GPUs were strong. And the stock climbed another 4% on Tuesday. This seems to be proof that AI’s effect on markets is still strong. The selloff in August looked like investors were stepping back until they saw that Nvidia was worth the share price. But their behavior since then—buying up the stock whenever there is any potentially positive news—shows they are still overly eager about the technology’s possibilities. Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. While Meta makes the lion’s share of its money from social networks, it’s no secret that CEO Mark Zuckerberg is angling to be one of the leaders in virtual reality and augmented reality. And while neither has taken off among the public at large just yet, Meta has continued to produce and improve tech tools to make them more accessible. Meta has worked with Ray-Ban on AR glasses since 2021, and officially launched the latest version, known as Orion, at its Meta Connect 2024 event last month. Meta’s Orion AR glasses have a built-in AI model that can generate information on demand, bringing 3D screen projections in front of a wearer’s eyes at any point in time, writes Forbes contributor Gerui Wang. Days after the new Orion glasses launched, a pair of Harvard students went viral with a video showing how an older model of Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses can be engineered to identify random people on the street. The students were able to connect the glasses to a facial recognition search engine, then used AI to connect to online databases for home addresses and Social Security numbers. The students walked around the campus area, identifying people and pulling up information like their home addresses and parents’ names. The students intended the video as a demo to show what LLMs and data scraping can do today, as well as show people databases that may have information about them. getty Passwords have been a necessary evil for computers for decades. They allow for user security, but they’re easily forgotten or stolen. More big tech companies have been moving away from passwords and toward passkeys, which are more secure on-device digital forms of authentication that require no memorization on users’ part, operating with secure logins to a larger service, QR code scans, or facial and fingerprint recognition. Last month, Google announced it was expanding its passkey program, allowing users to save passkeys to Google Password Manager from Windows, masOS, Linux and Android devices. Basically, for most devices on which Chrome might be used, a previously saved passkey can unlock a user’s account without requiring a separate password, writes Forbes senior contributor Davey Winder. Last week, Samsung made a similar announcement, Winder wrote in a separate article, making its 2025 models of its smart TV, refrigerator and appliances all work with passkeys instead of passwords. Atlassian President Anu Bharadwaj. Thousands of companies across the globe use Atlassian’s collaboration tools—which include Jira, Confluence, Trello and Loom—to work together and manage projects. I talked to President Anu Bharadwaj about how Atlassian serves companies’ tech and AI needs, culture at the 22-year-old, founder-led company, and its growth prospects. This interview has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A portion of this interview was also excerpted in the Forbes CEO newsletter. The complete conversation is available here. What are you seeing in the way of AI demand from enterprises, and what are you doing to meet it? Bharadwaj: AI demand for enterprises has gone through a bit of a crest and a trough over the last year and a half. Atlassian builds a lot of collaboration software—mostly things like project management tools, knowledge management tools like company intranets, wiki or tools like Trello, Jira. We announced over the last year a number of AI-driven offerings in our portfolio. One, Atlassian Intelligence, really helps users in the workflow of project management, of writing content, writing articles or sharing collaborative documents with their teams. We brought a lot of AI features in the middle of that workflow to help summarize, edit your content, figure out how to draw information from multiple sources and answer a question that a new employee might have. We built that into the platform. In addition, we have an AI-centric offering that we call Rovo, which really helps teams build agents which can automate and take the next step and action in a smart and intelligent way in any use case that they might be operating in. I’ve worked at Atlassian for 10 years. When we launched it 18 months ago, it was the most positive reception that we’ve ever received across our products. We have millions of users on an active basis. Enterprises, especially, were battling with the problem of: We have a lot of information and a lot of data across the company, but how do we really make use of this? How do we make this accessible and actionable to all of our employees? The two offerings across Atlassian Intelligence and Rovo helped answer that particular question for our enterprises. You said you’ve seen AI enthusiasm peak and also go down into a trough in the last 18 months. What has brought it down, and where are things right now? Initially when the technology wave broke out, there was a lot of promise around what can AI do. It’s hard to predict timelines. But when people talked about AI, we talked about the full spectrum of what’s possible, so a lot of customers saw the extent to which AI can be deployed. We started talking about AI doing code generation. I heard a lot of questions about: Do you think software developers are no longer going to be required? Are we going to replace all the engineers in a company with AI? Which is honestly not a question anybody can answer, and we should be suspicious if somebody gives a certain answer. But the timeline over which that happens, if it happens, is very long. When we started out with AI, there was a lot of hype around all of that appearing tomorrow. What is definitely possible is augmenting existing people that do certain jobs. There are really a lot of automated AI workflows that can help support people. A lot of enterprises thought about what’s the extreme possible application of AI? Now they’re seeing what are applications that are realistic and possible? I would say what is possible and realistic today and in the short-term is still a phenomenal uplift. At Atlassian, we’re a 12,000 person company, and we’ve deployed our own virtual service agents powered by AI. Over half of the service requests that we needed to have our people answer are now handled by the AI agent. A customer who uses our virtual service agents has managed to reroute roughly 85% of the service requests they used to ask humans to handle to the agent first. So the productivity benefits are quite dramatic in specific use cases and specific arenas. I think enterprises are going through that calibration of saying, Okay, what is immediately actionable and where can I see evidence of this happening right now? You are not only a company that creates these solutions, but you’re also an enterprise yourself. What kind of use of AI systems do you have internally at Atlassian? How did you develop them and how does that inform what you do as a company? It’s one of our company priorities. We think about it in two lenses: What can we do to serve our customers and what can we do to use it ourselves as a public company? We’ve tried a few things. Some things have worked, some things have not worked. Because we are a company that spends a lot on R&D, we have a 6,000-person-strong engineering workforce. We think about what does a software engineer really need help with on a day-to-day basis, and code gen has been particularly helpful for us in speeding up the coding part of what a software engineer does. But nearly 80% of [where] a software engineer or developer spends their time on is not coding. How do we help deploy AI to all of the other surrounding areas such that a software engineer’s life gets better? We’ve built several internal agents, like Rovo, which is an agent framework. We’ve built agents that can help translate user experiences from designers directly into deployable code. We’ve built agents that can help prepare deployment environments that software developers can automatically deploy into CI/CD workflows. Because we are also a software development provider, it helps us in two ways: using it ourselves and also making it available for customers. A second category is around customer support or service requests. This can take the form of external customers calling up service centers or filing tickets, or even internal help desk customers. We are now a 12,000-person-strong company. As new hires come online, they tend to submit requests like, I need a new laptop in this particular geo, or I have this question about payroll. A lot of HR, IT, those sorts of service workflows, that is an area where we’ve seen dramatic productivity benefits. Then there’s this third category around collaboration and knowledge workers, which is largely around the blank page problem: How do you start creating content given a few cues, and then how do you iterate on top of it? I want to change the tone of it. It should sound as though Anu said this; it shouldn’t sound like it’s some kind of corporate comms coming in based on attempts. A lot of that category of use cases around communication, editing, summarizing, drawing content from multiple sources—both content creation and knowledge discovery—has been the third category where AI has been particularly helpful for us. The thing that we’ve discovered [is] the number of SaaS tools, the number of products that enterprises use has been exploding over the last few years. Companies used to consolidate on an ERP platform, but then the era of SaaS began. A typical enterprise now uses 150 plus of these tools. Information gets fragmented everywhere. Braintrust, a year-old startup that monitors AI products and helps them perform more accurately, recently closed a Series A funding round led by a16z partner Martin Casado. $36 million: Size of the round, which brings its value up to about $150 million, according to Forbes calculations 80%+: Factual accuracy of an AI system that has used Braintrust for a few weeks, according to the company ‘A tool for helping everyone else to build AI software’: How founder and CEO Ankur Goyal described Braintrust As economic indicators improve, companies might become more active in M&A. And while this impacts many areas of business, it’s important to remember that it also brings cybersecurity risks. Executives constantly have decisions to make, and few of them are easy. Here are some ways successful billionaires have streamlined their decision-making processes. In a motion to dismiss Elon Musk’s federal lawsuit against OpenAI filed this week, how did the startup behind ChatGPT describe the xAI founder’s case? A. A money grab from the world’s richest person B. The next chapter in a saga of regret for Musk’s early departure C. Another opportunity for Musk to see his name in headlines D.

On 8 October 2024, famed global macro hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry posted a thought-provoking message on the social media platform X, discussing Bitcoin’s place in the broader financial landscape and warning of potential dangers in traditional financial markets. Hendry’s commentary compared Bitcoin’s market capitalization to that of major tech stocks, highlighting the potential instability in financial markets tied to those assets. Hendry opened by calling Bitcoin “everyone’s phantom, good or bad,” suggesting that while Bitcoin is often a topic of debate, its overall impact on the current financial conversation is relatively small due to its size. He explained that Bitcoin’s total market capitalization, standing at around $1 trillion, is dwarfed by the $42 trillion valuation of tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq 100 (represented by QQQ). He said that this vast discrepancy in size means that Bitcoin doesn’t hold significant sway in current financial market dynamics, but it does possess a unique attraction for potential upside growth due to its smaller relative size. In Hendry’s analogy, he likened Bitcoin’s role in financial markets to Newton’s Cradle, where mass is a crucial factor in determining how forces move through the system. In this case, traditional large-cap tech stocks—such as those in the so-called “Mag-7,” worth about $13 trillion—are the key players in today’s financial landscape. These stocks carry tremendous influence due to their size, making them the focal point of Hendry’s concern. He warned that if these tech stocks falter, the implications could be disastrous for the broader market, leading to margin calls and a cascade of financial disruptions. A major part of Hendry’s caution stemmed from his discussion of “moneyness,” or how close an asset’s value is to the perceived safety of a U.S. Treasury bill (T-bill). In his view, tech stocks, despite their current valuations, are far more volatile than T-bills and could lose significant value in a relatively short time frame. He noted that T-bills are highly stable and are not subject to drastic devaluations—unlike stocks, which have, in the past, lost as much as 83% of their value in an 18-month period. Hendry’s concern focused on the use of these overvalued tech stocks as collateral for loans. He warned that banks may need to reevaluate the true worth of this collateral in the event of a downturn. He believes that if these stocks lose value, the credit market could unravel, causing massive margin calls and liquidity issues throughout the financial system. In response to this risk, Hendry suggested that banks should reduce their exposure to these assets as a protective measure, though this would be challenging due to the market’s dependence on liquidity. Finally, Hendry hinted that he and financial analyst David Levenson are closely monitoring the growth and deceleration of these major assets. He concluded with a sobering thought: if these financial “beasts” cannot grow, they will eventually collapse.

Title: PC shipments fall in Q3 despite AI push by Microsoft, chipmakers
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-shipments-fall-in-q3-despite-ai-push-by-microsoft-chipmakers-151502305.html

The global PC industry hit a snag in the third quarter, as worldwide shipments declined for the first time in three quarters — despite hype around so-called artificial intelligence PCs and growth in the US and Japan. According to Gartner, third quarter PC shipments, or devices sent out to retailers for sale, fell 1.3% year over year to 62.9 million units from 63.8 million units in the same period in 2023. Shipments dropped the most in China, with Gartner reporting a 10% collapse in demand in the country as government and state-affiliated entities sought out fewer desktops. Shipments in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa took a less dramatic hit than China, dropping 1.5% due to a flurry of events that Gartner says distracted consumers, including elections in the UK and France and sporting events like the Olympics. The US, meanwhile, saw a 5.6% increase in shipments, while Japan saw double-digit growth in the quarter. Still, the PC industry is in the midst of a broader comeback after years of declines and the massive amount of growth it experienced at the onset of the pandemic. At the time, consumers and enterprises bought up virtually as many PCs as they could get their hands on to ensure they had the means to work and stay entertained while stuck in their homes for months on end. But that boom meant people who might have been holding off on buying PCs ended up purchasing them sooner than they otherwise would have, pulling future sales forward. With so many customers outfitted with new PCs, demand crumbled, leading to an extended slump that lasted roughly two years, including the worst decline in 17 years in 2023. The slump hit companies ranging from PC manufacturers for Microsoft (MSFT) to chipmakers Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA). In Q2 2023, as sales struggled, Microsoft reported that its Windows OEM sales, or sales of its Windows operating system to laptop and desktop manufacturers, fell 39% year over year. Intel and AMD saw similar declines, with Intel reporting that its first quarter 2023 Client Computing Group revenue, the organization responsible for PC chip sales, dropped an incredible 38% compared to Q1 2022. AMD reported a 65% year-over-year drop in net revenue in its Client group in 2023 from $2.1 billion to $739 million. The shipment declines come as the PC industry is pushing the concept of AI PCs, or computers outfitted with neural processing units (NPUs) or high-powered graphics cards that can run AI applications locally rather than via the cloud. Microsoft is pushing its own version of AI PCs it refers to as Copilot+ PCs, which meet certain hardware requirements such as powerful NPUs. But the marketing doesn’t seem to be paying off. According to Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa, AI PCs “did not boost the demand for PCs since buyers have yet to see their clear benefits or business value.” What’s more, she said, the end of Windows 10 support in 2025 didn’t drive updates in areas like China. There’s still plenty of debate about whether AI will become a huge selling point for consumer electronics, whether that’s PCs or smartphones. So far, Microsoft has shown off a number of potentially useful AI features for Windows 11, including its Click to Do option that provides you with a context-sensitive set of options to take action on what you’re viewing on your screen. Microsoft says you can do things like remove or blur the background in a photo or perform a visual search using Bing, allowing the search engine to search for content based on images rather than words. But it’s not clear yet if AI is a major selling point for consumers. Jefferies recently downgraded Apple’s stock saying that expectations for AI-powered iPhones are overblown. And if that holds true, you can bet it’ll be the same for PCs. Regardless of the declines in Q3 or whether AI proves to be the kind of catalyst the industry needs, Kitagawa says PC shipments should improve for the year as a whole and blow up in 2025. “At the worldwide level, PC demand will see more uptake toward the end of 2024 and more robust growth in 2025, when the PC refresh will be at its peak,” said Kitagawa.

Title: Morgan Stanley Details What Caused NVIDIA’s Blackwell Hiccup, Asserts That The Blackwell Production Ramp-Up Appears “Quite Strong”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Given the quantum of fund inflows into AI-related investment themes, Wall Street appears laser-focused on NVIDIA's Blackwell production ramp-up as a guarantor of sorts for the secular AI tailwind. Today, Morgan Stanley has penned yet another note on NVIDIA's latest GPU architecture, this time choosing to divulge some additional information regarding what exactly caused a production bottleneck over the summer. As we've noted in previous posts, NVIDIA had confirmed the rumors of a minor Blackwell design flaw during its recent earnings call, but assured investors that the resulting low-yields issue was rectified by implementing a few minor changes to the photomask - a specific template that is used to create bespoke patterns on semiconductor wafers. NVIDIA $NVDA Blackwell ramp appears "quite strong" and issues with initial Blackwell silicon are "totally behind us", says Morgan Stanley, reiterating at 'Overweight' with a $150 price-target: "In the shorter term, the Blackwell ramp appears to be quite strong, with no major… — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) October 10, 2024 Now, Morgan Stanley is out with its own take on the Blackwell production hiccup, noting that the low-yields issue was only discovered in the post-packaging stage. The ensuing scrapping of the subpar units resulted in a loss of "CoWoS and HBM3e," which were already in short supply and only aggravated NVIDIA's supply problems. Morgan Stanley goes on to note: "But those issues are behind the company and there is high conviction in prior guidance that they will have several billion in Blackwell revenue in the January quarter." Elsewhere, Morgan Stanley has reiterated that it now sees a "quite strong" Blackwell production ramp-up, "with no major changes to the roadmaps and every indication that business remains robust with very high forward visibility, in line with all of our checks." In a critical insight, Morgan Stanley notes: "Any new Blackwell orders now that aren't already in queue will be shipped late next year, as they are booked out 12 months or so, which continues to drive strong short term demand for Hopper which will still be a major factor though the year." Of course, the Wall Street titan has already stated that it sees NVIDIA shipping up to 450,000 units of the Blackwell GPUs in the December-ending quarter, resulting in between $5 billion and $10 billion in revenue. Moreover, Morgan Stanley believes that NVIDIA will produce between 700,000 and 800,000 units of Blackwell GPUs in Q1'25, which corresponds to a 3x sequential increase in volumes. At the same time, the bank sees Hopper volumes at 1.5 million units in Q4'24, and at around 1 million units in Q1'25.

Amazon Pharmacy is expanding its pharmacy services to 20 more U.S. cities by 2025, offering fast, free delivery of prescription medications. Amazon’s new pharmacies will be embedded within its Same-Day Delivery sites, enabling swift medication delivery. The service offers a digital-first experience, 24/7 access to pharmacists, and various ways to save on prescriptions. By 2025, nearly 45% of U.S. customers are expected to be eligible for same-day delivery, allowing medications to arrive within hours of being ordered. Leveraging its vast logistics network, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN aims to provide a rapid, efficient pharmacy service that directly delivers medications to customers’ doors. Dr. Vin Gupta, Chief Medical Officer of Amazon Pharmacy, emphasized the importance of rapid access to prescriptions. “There’s often a crucial window after diagnosis when starting medication is most critical,” he said. Amazon’s pharmacy expansion also aims to address the growing issue of “pharmacy deserts,” where many communities are over 10 miles away from the nearest pharmacy. Traditional mail-order prescriptions often take up to 10 days to arrive, leaving many underserved. Amazon’s rapid delivery and pharmacist availability close the care gap, especially in areas with limited access to healthcare services. John Love, VP of Amazon Pharmacy, highlighted Amazon’s efforts to streamline medication delivery and offer clear pricing, automatic coupons, and discounts for Prime members. Innovations such as RxPass, a $5-a-month subscription for 60 common medications, and savings of up to 80% on generics demonstrate Amazon’s commitment to making healthcare more accessible and affordable. Since its launch in 2020, Amazon Pharmacy has integrated technology to modernize pharmacy operations while maintaining clinical oversight. Hannah McClellan, VP of Operations, Product, and Technology at Amazon Pharmacy, added that feedback from customers and physicians has been overwhelmingly positive, reinforcing the importance of fast medication delivery. Price Action: At last check Thursday, AMZN stock was up 0.99% at $187 during the premarket session. Read Next: Photo by Koshiro K via Shutterstock © 2024 Benzinga.com.

Title: Rating the Retailers: The Best Stores for PCs and Electronics

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. In today's tech-saturated world, you have more options than ever when it comes to buying the electronics you need. Whether you're shopping for a new smartphone, a graphics card for your PC, or even just a set of batteries for your TV remote, the range of available retailers is vast. You can order online from the comfort of your home, visit a local big box store, or even buy directly from the manufacturer’s website. Each option has its own perks. But with so many choices, how do you decide where to shop? Which retailer offers the best overall experience, whether online or in-person? Last year, we set out to answer those questions with our first-ever Readers' Choice survey for Retailers. We asked thousands of PCMag readers to share the stores they buy electronics from and rate them on a wide range of qualitative measures, including things like prices, product availability, payment options, shipping, and even the quality of the onsite product descriptions and images. The result was a definitive, data-backed ranking of the best tech retailers in the US. Now it's time for round two. This year, 34 retailers qualify for inclusion in our results. The following charts break down the ratings for online, brick-and-mortar, and hybrid retailers (ie, companies that run online and physical stores). We also take things a step further this year by comparing different store types, including mobile carriers, tech manufacturers with retail chains, and big box/warehouse stores. In other words, next time you go shopping for anything electronic, these are the outlets you should head to first. For 2024, we introduced a key change to the survey: instead of giving stores a single overall satisfaction score, they now receive separate scores for their online and in-person experiences. We combine these ratings for retailers that meet our survey threshold in both categories and give the score a weight based on the number of responses it received for online versus offline shopping. This methodology helps us get a more accurate picture of the companies that excel at both online and in-person retail. Using the aforementioned scoring system, Micro Center earns the highest combined satisfaction score for both online and physical store experiences, and thereby secures our Readers' Choice Award. Although the company has a limited number of brick-and-mortar locations, customers who visit those stores or shop via microcenter.com are overwhelmingly satisfied. (Note: Click the down, left, and right arrows in our interactive charts to view different elements of our survey results.) However, Micro Center’s victory isn't a landslide. Costco comes in a close second in both overall satisfaction and likelihood to recommend, which is definitely worth keeping in mind if you prefer to shop in person. There might not be a Micro Center store near where you live, but there's more likely a Costco within driving distance. Last year's best overall tech retailer, B&H Photo Video, earns a top spot again this year, specifically for its online storefront. Customers rate it higher than any other brand in our survey when it comes to overall satisfaction, likelihood to recommend, and customer service. B&H also earns a Readers’ Choice Award for its stellar shopping cart and checkout experience, and scores notably high for mobile shopping—even higher than Amazon. Another standout in this category is Apple, which leads among manufacturer-run stores. The company's online storefront, Apple.com, receives top marks for product availability and quality, standing out among competitors like Canon, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Logitech, and Microsoft. Other sub-category wins include Crutchfield for its top-notch customer service, Walmart and Costco for their great membership/club costs, Amazon for its stellar shipping, and Temu for its exceptionally affordable prices. That being said, it's worth noting that certain retailers who made the podium this year also earn abysmal scores in specific categories. Temu, for example, earns high praise for its low prices but also comes in dead last for product quality and second-to-last for shipping speed. The site has also come under fire for ethical reasons in recent years, so keep that in mind before you dive in and start shopping. When it comes to in-store experiences, Micro Center reigns supreme. If you’re fortunate enough to live near one of its 28 locations (with a 29th opening soon in Santa Clara, CA), it's worth a visit the next time you need new tech gear. Customers rate Micro Center exceptionally high in overall satisfaction, likelihood to recommend, product selection, and customer service. An interesting thing to note here is the stark difference in scores for physical and digital storefronts. For example, Walmart makes both the online and brick-and-mortar list, yet earns much higher scores for its online store. The same goes for Amazon. It is at the absolute bottom of the heap when it comes to in-store retail (it currently has just 22 Amazon Go stores speckled across the country) but near the top of the list for online shopping. Not all retailers operate the same way. Some only sell their own products, while others stock items from a wide range of manufacturers or focus on specific categories like mobile phones. This can make direct comparisons between retailers tricky, so in an effort to simplify things, this section breaks down retailers by the type of stores they operate. Among brands with stores (both online and/or brick-and-mortar) that sell their own products, it's no surprise to see Apple at the top. The company earns industry-leading ratings for overall satisfaction, product quality, product availability, customer service, and likelihood to recommend. The only place Apple falters (as we see in many surveys) is price. Customers love most things about Apple, but not the high cost of its products. A very close third here is Amazon, but this is more of a courtesy inclusion since Amazon’s numbers are based on selling anything and everything, not just its own products. That means the next vendor down—Canon USA—is another great retailer to consider, especially if you’re in the market for a camera or printer. The big three mobile carriers in the US don’t score particularly well—at least not when compared with the other vendors in the lists above. But if you have to pick one to shop at, your best bet is T-Mobile. It has far better scores than AT&T or Verizon in most categories. That said, Verizon does well in some categories—most notably product availability, product quality, shipping cost, and shipping speed. But its overall satisfaction numbers are a half point below what T-Mobile’s stores earn. This year, our Readers' Choice Award for big box retailers goes to a somewhat unexpected vendor: Lowes. Despite the fact that it doesn't specialize in tech gear or electronics, it easily outpaces its competitors in terms of overall satisfaction and likelihood to recommend. Interestingly, both Lowes and Home Depot beat their more tech-focused rivals when it comes to product selection, availability, and quality. Best Buy (the most-used big box retailer among our respondents) earns the lowest overall satisfaction score of all—lower than many competitors that don't specialize in technology products. When it comes to stores that require club memberships, Costco is the most beloved among PCMag readers, earning top marks for overall satisfaction, likelihood to recommend, value, and satisfaction with price. The biggest of the three, Sam’s Club, only outscores Costco in a few areas (product selection and shipping speed for online orders), and they tie in many others. BJs only bests the other two when it comes to payment options. Otherwise, Costco thoroughly dominates the field. It sweeps the remaining categories and earns an impressive 9.5 out of 10 for its return policy. The PCMag Readers' Choice survey for Retailers was in the field from August 22 to September 15, 2024.

After achieving surprise early success in the smart glasses market through a partnership with Ray-Ban, Meta is ginning up excitement for the prototype of a much more advanced pair of glasses called Orion, a project nearly a decade in the making. Zuckerberg's reveal of Orion late last month has triggered a level of enthusiasm that's unfamiliar in the metaverse. The triumphant demo, at Meta's annual Connect event, was a relief to many employees and represented an internal shift in sentiment toward Zuckerberg's costly hardware ambitions, according to people close to the company who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak to the press on the matter. At the start of the demo, Zuckerberg pulled the device out of a locked metal briefcase. He showed off the gadget — a pair of black, thick-framed AR glasses — to the live audience before placing it on his face. Orion comes with a wireless puck that allows it to run holographic virtual images on top of what users see in real life. It also relies on a wristband that picks up on a user's neural signals to let them control the device. The demo was seamless. The crowd oohed and aahed. Rave product reviews followed from the few who got to test it. CNBC's Julia Boorstin described a call she had with her producer, saying, "It was like I was FaceTiming with him but he was in my glasses." The Verge's Alex Heath played Zuckerberg in a game of Pong and wrote that he "noticed little to no lag in the game." "The right way to look at Orion is as a time machine," Zuckerberg said at Connect. "These glasses exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting." Following the Orion showcase, Meta is preparing to strengthen its relationship with software developers as it works toward building a consumer version of the device, and to pushing its current generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses to more consumers for the 2024 holiday shopping season. The company is also looking at ways to bring the technology developed for the Orion wristband to its other consumer devices, notably the Quest VR headsets and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, according to a person familiar with the matter. For Meta, the uptick in excitement among employees and users comes well after Wall Street jumped back into the stock. After the company lost almost two-thirds of its value in 2022 and then slashed about a quarter of its workforce, or 21,000 jobs, Meta's stock price almost tripled last year and is up more than 60% in 2024, reaching a fresh high this month. Meta proved the resilience of its dominant online advertising business, rebuilding the underlying technology after Apple's iOS privacy change made it harder to target users, and adding generative artificial intelligence tools to make it easier for brands to run campaigns. But proving that it can mimic its digital ad success in a totally different market has been a persistent challenge. Facebook's initial foray into VR came in 2014 with the $2 billion purchase of Oculus. Since then, the company has poured more than $63 billion into what's now called Reality Labs, its AR and VR hardware and software division, and it's recording operating losses in the billions of dollars per quarter. In the second quarter, Reality Labs generated just $353 million in revenue, accounting for less than 1% of the company's total sales. Industrywide, global shipments of VR and AR headsets in the period sank roughly 28% from a year earlier to 1.1 million units, according to market researcher IDC. "This is a very long-term bet," Zuckerberg said in July 2023. "At a deep level, I understand the discomfort that a lot of investors have with it because it's just outside of the model of I think even most long-term investors." Orion provides a tangible example of the company's strategy and a logical and compelling next step following smart glasses, people familiar with Reality Labs told CNBC. Meta declined to comment. Meta is planning to start courting developers next year, as it tries to get them excited about building apps for Orion so the company can learn what might resonate with consumers, according to people familiar with the company's road map. The push into the developer community would coincide with Meta's expected debut of the fourth generation of its Llama family of AI models. By releasing a more powerful Llama, Meta is hoping that developers would be able to incorporate the software in their future AR apps to help power tasks like recognizing real-world objects and more accurately reacting to voice commands, the people said. Ultimately, Meta is working toward building a consumer version of Orion, something that could happen within two years, they said. That timeline may be overly ambitious considering how long it took to get Orion this far. Facebook began working on the device as far back as 2016 under the leadership of Oculus' then chief scientist, Michael Abrash, according to people familiar with the matter. Abrash is now chief scientist at Reality Labs. In 2018, the project was moved out of research and development and was put on the product path under the guidance of Andrew "Boz" Bosworth, who was Facebook's head of hardware at the time and is now Meta's technology chief. At one point, the company had a version of the device that offered AR visuals but it had to be in extremely controlled settings to work, the people said. For example, visuals didn't work outdoors, they said. Meta has been testing functioning versions of Orion glasses for well over two years, the people said, getting the product to a point where it could finally be unveiled to the broader company and to outsiders. The company finished the prototype in March. Engineers put a lot of work into getting the device to weigh less than 100 grams (3.5 ounces), about twice the weight of a heavy pair of glasses, and to have a 70-degree field of view, sources said. Zuckerberg, who's been the driving force behind the company's advances in AR and VR, made the ultimate decision to go public with Orion, the people said. Meta is likely years away from being able to deliver a consumer version of Orion and has numerous challenges to overcome to reach mass production. "One could criticize Orion as vaporware," Joseph Bonner, an analyst at Argus Research, wrote in a report to clients on Oct. 4, referring to "technology that may not end up in an actual product." Bonner, who recommends buying the stock, said the product demonstrates "Meta's continued commitment to virtual and mixed reality applications." Meta will need to develop a global manufacturing supply chain that can account for some of the rare materials used in the device. One particular hurdle will be figuring out how to get mass quantities of silicon carbide, which is used for the displays in the Orion lenses. Meta recently hired someone from semiconductor contract manufacturing company GlobalFoundries to help develop and oversee the supply chain for Orion and related AR and VR devices, people with knowledge of the matter said. In the meantime, Meta is looking to build on the success of its second-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Released in partnership with EssilorLuxottica in September of last year, the product featured a number of upgrades, including better camera quality, improved battery life and an AI voice assistant. The smart glasses went viral on TikTok during the holiday shopping season, and sales exceeded both companies' expectations. More than 730,000 units have been sold in their first three quarters since release, according to IDC. Zuckerberg told investors in July that they were "a bigger hit sooner than expected." Last month, Meta and Luxottica agreed to extend their partnership, with plans to release a bulkier, third generation of their glasses in time for the coming holiday season. The new device is expected to include a small display in one of the lenses, people familiar with the matter said. A Luxottica representative didn't respond to a request for comment. Meta is also opening a pop-up shop to showcase the smart glasses and to get them in front of more consumers. The pop-up shop will be at a retail space in Los Angeles. A job post by BDS Connected Solutions says the company is looking for retail staffers in the West Hollywood neighborhood. "We're staffing up for the ultimate Meta pop-up experience in the heart of Los Angeles," BDS says in a post on X. "With lowriders, street vibes, and everything that makes LA iconic, this pop-up is a true celebration of Southern California culture."

Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL) declined in premarket trading after the carrier's third-quarter results and fourth-quarter sales outlook came in below analysts' estimates. The carrier also confirmed costs of around $500 million that Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ed Bastian had estimated following the CrowdStrike (CRWD)-caused global IT outage in July that resulted in 7,000 Delta flight cancellations over a five-day period. Delta posted third-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.50 on revenue of $15.68 billion, below consensus expectations of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Delta also projected fourth-quarter revenue growth of between 2% and 4%, lower than estimates. Fleshing out details of the damage from the IT outage this summer, Delta said it lost out on direct revenue of $380 million, largely from refunds and customer compensation, and incurred additional costs of roughly $170 million. The costs were slightly offset by $50 million in saved fuel expenses from canceling the 7,000 flights over five days. Delta shares, which had risen by more then 25% this year through Wednesday's close, were down 3% less than an hour before the opening bell.

If the merger with Kroger doesn’t go through, the CEO of Albertsons Cos. Inc. said in court Wednesday that his company might have to consider layoffs and leave certain markets to remain competitive and financially secure in the long term.Vivek Sankaran testified for several hours in Denver District Court during the second week of the trial in the state of Colorado’s lawsuit that seeks to block the consolidation of the two supermarket chains. The Colorado Attorney General’s Office contends that the $24.6 billion merger would harm customers, store employees and suppliers to the chains because it would reduce competition.Kroger, which owns King Soopers and City Markets in Colorado, and Albertsons, which owns Safeway, account for more than 50% of the supermarket sales in Colorado, according to state attorneys. A merger of the two competitors would violate state antitrust laws, the attorney general’s office said.But Sankaran said the two chains see merging as the best way to compete against Walmart, first nationally in grocery sales, as well as such fast-growing food sellers as Amazon and Costco. Walmart and Sam’s Club, owned by Walmart, account for about a quarter of the country’s grocery business, he said.“We can do many things to improve the company, but at some point the ability to compete with the Amazons and Costcos and Walmarts of the world, you just need added scale. We knew we wouldn’t be able to get that by ourselves,” Sankaran said.Albertsons began looking for ways to grow and merging with another company was one of the possibilities. Soon after Albertsons and Kroger announced consolidation plans in October 2022, several United Food and Commercial Workers locals, state and local officials came out in opposition.The Federal Trade Commission has sued to put the merger on hold until it can finish its proceedings aimed at stopping the companies’ plan. A decision in the FTC’s lawsuit is pending.A trial is underway in the lawsuit by Attorney General Bob Ferguson of Washington state, whose complaints against the merger are similar to Colorado’s. In Colorado, Albertsons and Kroger are prime rivals in the grocery industry, according to an analysis presented by the state last week in court. The analysis produced by an expert witness for the state played down the competition posed by Costco, Amazon, Whole Foods and other retailers.But asked who he sees as Albertsons’ biggest threat, Sankaran said Walmart, Amazon and Costco are among his biggest worries. “These competitors are growing so fast and they’re already large. They’re who I worry about in the long run.”Sankaran said data on where customers in Colorado shop shows that for every $1 spent on groceries, Albertsons reaps 14 cents. Kroger takes in 16 cents and Amazon gets about 5 cents. Walmart captures the biggest share: 20 cents on the dollar. The rest of the money goes to a variety of entities, including Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s.To try to ensure there will be competition in the market after the merger, Kroger and Albertsons have struck a $2.9 billion deal with C&S Wholesale Grocers, which would buy 579 of their stores nationwide. In Colorado, C&S would buy 91 Safeway and Albertsons stores and a dairy plant. Kroger would retain 14 of the stores in the state.Kroger and Albertsons have said C&S, a grocery distributor that now operates just 25 retail grocery stores, has the resources to take over the stores. But Roger Davidson, an industry consultant testifying Wednesday for the state, said he expects that stores bought by C&S will see declining revenue and some will likely close.Davidson said C&S won’t have enough people or a strong enough retail infrastructure to successfully run all the stores it plans to acquire.Jason Slothouber with the attorney general’s office asked Sankaran about the potential impacts on communities and workers if stores in more remote parts of the state close after the merger.“Even if C&S crashes and burns, you have this golden parachute for yourself,” Slothouber said.Sankaran acknowledged that he will receive a total of $43 million in equity and severance if the merger is completed. “I realize it’s a lot of money for a guy who came from India with a suitcase. I don’t take that lightly,” he said.Related Articles Retail | State says Kroger-Albertsons merger may cost Coloradans $500M per year; companies dispute claim Retail | Colorado next up to argue its case against Kroger-Albertsons mega merger Retail | Montbello’s status as a food desert to end next year with $97M project that includes grocery store, housing and more Retail | Kroger and Albertsons make a final pitch for their merger before a judge decides whether to block it Retail | A state’s experience with grocery chain mergers spurs a fight to stop Albertsons’ deal with Kroger But he called Slothhouber’s questions about stores closing and people losing their jobs “hypotheticals” that he couldn’t answer.Kroger and Albertsons have said that stores won’t close, people won’t lose their jobs and wages will increase if the merger goes through.

Title: Meta Platforms or Microsoft: Oppenheimer Chooses the Superior AI Stock to Buy

The tech sector has been powering market gains over the past year, and AI stocks have been at the forefront of tech. AI has the potential to overturn the tech world and recast the general economy; in doing so, it also has the potential to be a gold mine for investors. But not every AI stock will fully realize that potential. Some are clearly going to lead in innovation or bring higher returns, and Wall Street’s analysts are busy now sorting out the equity landscape to find those shining opportunities. Covering the AI/tech world from Oppenheimer, two 5-star analysts are taking divergent views on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Both companies have been making waves in the AI world lately; Microsoft was an early backer of generative AI, while Meta has recently been finding innovative ways to use the technology. So, let’s take a closer look to find out which one is the investment bank’s choice as the superior AI stock to buy. Meta Platforms We’ll start with Meta, the parent firm of Facebook and the world’s leader in the social media field. The company was founded as Facebook, 20 years ago; in 2021, after Facebook had made several social media acquisitions, the company rebranded as Meta Platforms. Today, Meta owns and operates Facebook, as well as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Through these platforms, the company can reach out to a huge audience – at the end of 2Q24 this year, Meta reported a Daily Active People (DAP) number of 3.27 billion, or nearly 40% of the world’s total population. An audience of that magnitude is an asset that cannot be discounted. Meta’s audience-asset lies at the heart of the company’s chief revenue driver, digital advertising. This is Meta’s core business, and in the second quarter of this year, the last quarter reported, the company showed a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across its platforms – as well as a 10% increase in the average price paid per ad. That led to a 22% year-over-year revenue gain, to a quarterly top line of $39.07 billion – a figure that also beat the forecast by $760 million. At the bottom line, Meta beat the Q2 forecast again, with the $5.16 EPS coming in 40 cents per share ahead of expectations. Solid revenues and consistent profits are only part of the story, however. Meta has been preparing itself to meet the future of the online world – and understands that that future is AI. The company is no stranger to AI tech, having put it to use in developing targeted digital advertising over the past several years, and using AI in its translation algorithms to make its social media platforms more widely accessible. But the real work is in generative AI, and Meta has two chief developments in this field. The first is Llama, Meta’s open-source AI software model. The company has already released Llama 3, and aims to use the platform to create a flexible and readily usable AI environment. Making the platform open-source allows users to develop tweaks and additions that will meet idiosyncratic needs, as well as permitting the public to make improvements. In addition to Llama, Meta has released an online AI chatbot/assistant, dubbed Meta AI. This interactive tool is available across all of the company’s social platforms, and has rapidly become a successful addition to the company’s toolbox – and popular with users. The chatbot had 400 million monthly active users at the end of August this year, with that number trending upwards quickly. Meta created Meta AI as a gen AI challenger to ChatGPT, and is well on that path. For Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, the most important factor here is Meta AI. He notes the recent expansion of the online assistant, and lays out how it will benefit the company as a whole. “META AI on track to be most-used AI assistant by year-end, ~500M MAU, with more country launches,” the 5-star analyst explained. “We believe the long term benefits from AI content recommendation, ad targeting, business messaging and ads generation will become more exciting to investors overtime, and support META’s terminal value. We believe China ecommerce remains strong, with results/guidance implying continued acceleration on 2-year growth (and no cautionary comments). Near term, we are also encouraged from the positive commentary surrounding US Facebook and Whatsapp young adult engagement.” These comments support Helfstein’s Outperform (Buy) rating on the shares, although his price target of $615 implies a modest 4% gain on the 12-month horizon, a low upside that is indicative of the stock’s continued gains (up 68% year-to-date). (To watch Helfstein’s track record, click here) Overall, META shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 46 recent reviews that include 42 to Buy, 3 to Hold, and 1 to Sell. However, due to the strong rally, the average target price of $611.20 suggests an upside of just 3% over the coming year. (See Meta stock forecast) Microsoft Corporation Now on to another tech giant. Microsoft made its name in the 70s and 80s as a leader in the PC market, and now its Windows operating systems and Office software packages have become the industry standard for home, small business, and enterprise-level PCs and laptops. Microsoft has managed this through a combination of developing quality products that do what the user needs and wants – and through smart marketing, making its Windows logo one of the world’s most recognizable brands. Today, Microsoft boasts a market cap of $3.08 trillion and is the world’s third-largest publicly traded company. Like Meta above, Microsoft has not been resting on its laurels. The company reached the top of the heap on its track record of proven products, and it’s using its deep resources and long expertise to adapt itself to the changes that AI is bringing to the world of tech. One of the most prominent of Microsoft’s uses of AI is the integration of the AI-powered Copilot online assistant feature to its Windows and Office software packages. Microsoft has been able to do this by building on its status as an early backer of generative AI tech. The company put billions into OpenAI, the firm that brought ChatGPT to the market – $13 billion, more precisely. In return for that investment, Microsoft has secured rights to 75% of OpenAI’s future profits. Microsoft’s royalties will drop to 49% once the initial investment is recouped. The company’s large AI investment hasn’t just brought it an additional income stream – Microsoft has also been able to integrate generative AI technology into its search engine, Bing. Bringing AI to the search engine has made the engine more responsive to natural language queries and improved search results, both of which make the search feature easier to use and more competitive with Google. AI has also become ever-more important to Microsoft’s cloud computing system, Azure, which competes with Google’s Cloud and Amazon’s AWS. Azure already has more than 200 cloud-based software tools available to subscribers, and adding AI to the mix provides enhancements and greater flexibility for users. Building out all of these AI features and tools, and adding them to existing platforms, does not come cheap – but as noted, Microsoft has deep pockets. And the company has buttressed that with consistent revenue growth. In the last quarter reported, fiscal 4Q24, the company brought in $64.7 billion at the top line, beating the forecast by $260 million and growing 15% year-over-year. The company’s earnings came to $2.95 per share, up 10% y/y and 2 cents per share ahead of the forecast. The company’s Azure cloud segment, however, grew at a slower pace than expected – rising 29% y/y compared to the 30% to 31% revenue growth that analysts were looking for. 5-star analyst Timothy Horan, however, is more worried about potential slowdowns and headwinds in the AI field. In his Oppenheimer note on MSFT, Horan explains his position, “We believe estimates for revenue and EPS are too high. Open AI losses are the primary concern and could be in the $2-3B range in FY25, which we were not previously modeling. As per our recent AI report, enterprises have been slow to adopt AI and associated revenues will likely disappoint. Other factors include the impact of heightened CapEx on higher depreciation, lower interest income and higher OpEx to support AI. Because MSFT are investing in once-in-a-generation technology, we don’t believe expanding margins will be a short-term priority. MSFT is trading at the midpoint of its five-year range of ~25x-35x P/E, and could trade to the lower end.” Horan follows this by downgrading his stance on MSFT from Outperform to Perform (Hold) and withholding a price target for the stock. (To watch Horan’s track record, click here) While the Oppenheimer view is cautious, Wall Street remains bullish on Microsoft. The 30 recent reviews, including a lopsided 22 to 3 Buy-Hold ratio, give the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating, while the $504.73 average target price and $414.71 trading price together suggest a 22% gain on the one-year horizon.

He notes the recent expansion of the online assistant, and lays out how it will benefit the company as a whole. “META AI on track to be most-used AI assistant by year-end, ~500M MAU, with more country launches,” the 5-star analyst explained. “We believe the long term benefits from AI content recommendation, ad targeting, business messaging and ads generation will become more exciting to investors overtime, and support META’s terminal value. We believe China ecommerce remains strong, with results/guidance implying continued acceleration on 2-year growth (and no cautionary comments). Near term, we are also encouraged from the positive commentary surrounding US Facebook and Whatsapp young adult engagement.” These comments support Helfstein’s Outperform (Buy) rating on the shares, although his price target of $615 implies a modest 4% gain on the 12-month horizon, a low upside that is indicative of the stock’s continued gains (up 68% year-to-date). (To watch Helfstein’s track record, click here) Overall, META shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 46 recent reviews that include 42 to Buy, 3 to Hold, and 1 to Sell. However, due to the strong rally, the average target price of $611.20 suggests an upside of just 3% over the coming year. (See Meta stock forecast) Microsoft Corporation Now on to another tech giant. Microsoft made its name in the 70s and 80s as a leader in the PC market, and now its Windows operating systems and Office software packages have become the industry standard for home, small business, and enterprise-level PCs and laptops. Microsoft has managed this through a combination of developing quality products that do what the user needs and wants – and through smart marketing, making its Windows logo one of the world’s most recognizable brands. Today, Microsoft boasts a market cap of $3.08 trillion and is the world’s third-largest publicly traded company. Like Meta above, Microsoft has not been resting on its laurels. The company reached the top of the heap on its track record of proven products, and it’s using its deep resources and long expertise to adapt itself to the changes that AI is bringing to the world of tech. One of the most prominent of Microsoft’s uses of AI is the integration of the AI-powered Copilot online assistant feature to its Windows and Office software packages. Microsoft has been able to do this by building on its status as an early backer of generative AI tech. The company put billions into OpenAI, the firm that brought ChatGPT to the market – $13 billion, more precisely. In return for that investment, Microsoft has secured rights to 75% of OpenAI’s future profits. Microsoft’s royalties will drop to 49% once the initial investment is recouped. The company’s large AI investment hasn’t just brought it an additional income stream – Microsoft has also been able to integrate generative AI technology into its search engine, Bing. Bringing AI to the search engine has made the engine more responsive to natural language queries and improved search results, both of which make the search feature easier to use and more competitive with Google. AI has also become ever-more important to Microsoft’s cloud computing system, Azure, which competes with Google’s Cloud and Amazon’s AWS. Azure already has more than 200 cloud-based software tools available to subscribers, and adding AI to the mix provides enhancements and greater flexibility for users. Building out all of these AI features and tools, and adding them to existing platforms, does not come cheap – but as noted, Microsoft has deep pockets. And the company has buttressed that with consistent revenue growth. In the last quarter reported, fiscal 4Q24, the company brought in $64.7 billion at the top line, beating the forecast by $260 million and growing 15% year-over-year. The company’s earnings came to $2.95 per share, up 10% y/y and 2 cents per share ahead of the forecast. The company’s Azure cloud segment, however, grew at a slower pace than expected – rising 29% y/y compared to the 30% to 31% revenue growth that analysts were looking for. 5-star analyst Timothy Horan, however, is more worried about potential slowdowns and headwinds in the AI field. In his Oppenheimer note on MSFT, Horan explains his position, “We believe estimates for revenue and EPS are too high. Open AI losses are the primary concern and could be in the $2-3B range in FY25, which we were not previously modeling. As per our recent AI report, enterprises have been slow to adopt AI and associated revenues will likely disappoint. Other factors include the impact of heightened CapEx on higher depreciation, lower interest income and higher OpEx to support AI. Because MSFT are investing in once-in-a-generation technology, we don’t believe expanding margins will be a short-term priority. MSFT is trading at the midpoint of its five-year range of ~25x-35x P/E, and could trade to the lower end.” Horan follows this by downgrading his stance on MSFT from Outperform to Perform (Hold) and withholding a price target for the stock. (To watch Horan’s track record, click here) While the Oppenheimer view is cautious, Wall Street remains bullish on Microsoft. The 30 recent reviews, including a lopsided 22 to 3 Buy-Hold ratio, give the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating, while the $504.73 average target price and $414.71 trading price together suggest a 22% gain on the one-year horizon.

Full Content:
Helen of Troy (NASDAQ: HELE), a leading global consumer products company, has reported favorable results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, surpassing market expectations. CEO Noel Geoffroy highlighted the company's strategic initiatives, such as Project Pegasus, which have contributed to its strong performance despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges. The company has seen a 9% increase in U.S. distribution and significant international sales growth. However, it reported a consolidated net sales decline of 3.5% for the quarter, attributed primarily to decreased demand in Beauty & Wellness. Adjusted EPS decreased to $1.21, with net income at $17 million. The company remains focused on long-term growth and efficiency improvements, with an emphasis on innovation and marketing investments. In conclusion, Helen of Troy's second quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call presented a mixed but overall positive picture, with the company beating expectations and focusing on strategic growth initiatives. While there are challenges ahead, particularly in the Beauty category, the company is taking steps to address these issues and capitalize on its strengths in distribution and product innovation. Helen of Troy's recent financial performance aligns with several key metrics and insights provided by InvestingPro. Despite the reported 3.5% decline in consolidated net sales, the company's financial health appears robust. InvestingPro data shows that Helen of Troy has a market capitalization of $1.67 billion and a P/E ratio of 11.33, suggesting that the stock may be undervalued relative to its earnings. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that management has been aggressively buying back shares, which could be seen as a vote of confidence in the company's future prospects. This aligns with the company's commitment to using free cash flow for capital deployment, including share repurchases, as mentioned in the earnings call. Another relevant InvestingPro Tip indicates that Helen of Troy's liquid assets exceed short-term obligations, which is a positive sign for the company's financial stability. This strong liquidity position could provide the flexibility needed to navigate the challenging macroeconomic environment and invest in growth initiatives like Project Pegasus. The company's profitability over the last twelve months, as noted by InvestingPro, is consistent with the reported net income of $17 million for the quarter. However, the InvestingPro data also shows a revenue decline of 3.96% over the last twelve months, which mirrors the company's reported sales decline and cautious outlook for the upcoming quarter. It's worth noting that InvestingPro offers 8 additional tips for Helen of Troy, providing investors with a more comprehensive analysis of the company's financial health and market position. These insights can be particularly valuable given the mixed signals in the company's recent earnings report. Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Helen of Troy Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Sabrina McKee, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Sabrina McKee: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Helen of Troy's second quarter fiscal 2025 earnings conference call. The agenda for the call this morning is as follows. I will begin with a brief discussion of forward-looking statements. Ms. Noel Geoffroy, the company's CEO, will comment on business performance and then provide some perspective on current trends. Then, Mr. Brian Grass, the company's CFO, will review the financials in more detail and discuss our outlook. Following this, we will open up the call for Q&A. This conference call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations with respect to future events or financial performance. Generally, the words anticipate, believe, expect, and other similar words are worth identifying forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause anticipated results to differ materially from the actual results. This conference call may also include information that may be considered non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures are not an alternative to GAAP financial information and may be calculated differently than the non-GAAP financial information disclosed by other parties. The company cautions listeners not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements or non-GAAP information. Before I turn the call over to Ms. Geoffroy, I would like to inform all interested parties that a copy of today's earnings release and related investment deck has been posted to the company's website at www.helenoftroy.com and can be found by navigating to the Investor Relations section of the site or by scrolling to the bottom of the homepage. The earnings release contains tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP-based measures. I will now turn the conference call over to Ms. Geoffroy. Noel Geoffroy: Thank you, Sabrina. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report second quarter results that were above expectations. During the quarter, we took decisive actions toward our long-term strategic initiatives, including strengthening the core and further shaping our growth portfolio. In addition, despite persistent macro headwinds, we are generating results on our efforts to reset and revitalize our business, which we believe indicates we are on the right path to improve our operating performance. Through our increasingly data-driven approach, we continue to see improvement in our brand fundamentals. Project Pegasus continues to be on track and is generating critical fuel for reinvestment in our brands. This fuel, combined with our sharper brand fundamentals, is leading to stronger marketing with new creative, new more agile media campaigns, better innovation, and better execution. We are also continuing to grow our distribution. Fiscal year-to-date, we meaningfully grew our U.S. weighted distribution by 9% year-over-year, making our brands increasingly available where our shoppers shop. All of these efforts contribute to improved market share performance, with eight of our key categories growing or maintaining share this fiscal year-to-date in our U.S. measured channels. Now to share an update on shaping our portfolio. We have previously shared that we were engaged in an active process to divest the business. Shortly after the end of the quarter, we opted to pause that process as the offers we received are not indicative of the value of the business or its potential. We will continue to consistently evaluate our brands to ensure we position the company for long-term success and growth. Our acquisition strategy remains to look for brands with strong global growth potential, are financially accretive, and meet our Better Together criteria. We will remain disciplined in our approach to both divestitures and acquisitions to ensure we are able to deliver on our commitment to increase shareholder value. Before I turn to the results for the quarter, I will provide an update on the Curlsmith and Tennessee distribution center operational issues. As previously discussed, we resolved the Curlsmith ERP integration issues. In the second quarter, we successfully integrated Curlsmith into our distribution network ahead of plan. With respect to our Tennessee distribution center, I'm pleased to share that we consistently improved our shipping execution and operating efficiency throughout the quarter and have now addressed the root causes of the technology issues we experienced. We are now servicing customers and consumers in line with our expectations and anticipate reaching our productivity goals by the end of the fiscal year with a continued eye on best-in-class service. Now let's turn to performance across our portfolio. Overall, we see our Home & Outdoor performance strengthening, our Wellness performance ahead of our expectations, and our International performance remains a bright spot. Our Beauty performance was below our expectations for the quarter, but we are taking focused actions to improve the fundamentals of the business and its brands. Starting with Home & Outdoor. OXO grew share fiscal year-to-date in core kitchen utensils, a category that we see as largely normalized post-pandemic. The brand achieved strong sell-through at Walmart (NYSE:WMT) following the June expansion into 3,200 stores and over five times increase versus the test with additional distribution coming soon. OXO is also gaining momentum in dry food storage with share growth fiscal year-to-date. OXO also continued strong momentum in coffee. Shortly after the end of the quarter, OXO launched our new portable Rapid Brewer coffee maker, which makes hot coffee or cold brew in five minutes or less. It has already earned positive reviews from Food & Wine and Consumer Reports. As I will discuss in more detail later, International performance, especially in EMEA, is also strong for OXO. Hydro Flask outperformed our expectations and is a key example of brand revitalization across innovation, distribution, and marketing. We still have many areas of opportunity, but are encouraged by our meaningful progress across all key focus areas. The new Travel Bottle was launched in the second quarter and provides consumers with the best of both worlds, the utility of fitting in most car cupholders or backpack pockets, and it is leak-proof. The new bottle comes with your choice of a Hydro Flask flip straw or chest cap along with a convenient carrying strap. Hydro Flask also successfully launched into Costco (NASDAQ:COST), a key retailer for expanded target consumer. The brand also benefited from strong distribution internationally with sales up in all key markets. Hydro Flask also launched a new brand campaign called, We Make It, You Own It. The campaign celebrates the individuality of the Hydro Flask consumer and highlights the broad array of products, configurations, and colors we offer for a wide range of consumer preferences and occasions. The brand also showed great consumer obsession and marketing agility this quarter by being a part of two relevant cultural moments, Brat Summer and the MTV Video Music Awards. Music artist Charli XCX launched her Brat Album in June with an iconic lime green album cover, leading Gen-Z to christen the summer as the Brat Summer, which was typified by Cool Girl style and Lime Green Everything. Hydro Flask quickly created a Brat Summer water bottle that we promoted on our social media account. Our Instagram post achieved Hydro Flask's highest year-to-date engagement rate, drove a double-digit lift in sales around the post, and gained the attention of Charli XCX, leading to a new partnership for her current concert tour and great overall exposure for the brand. Our second cultural moment came in late summer when the VMA's Best New Artist winner walked the red carpet and sat in the front row with a custom Hydro Flask in hand. Social engagement on that post have now eclipsed our Brat Summer post. These are two great examples of moving at the speed of culture, which is critical to driving relevance with our target consumer. Turning to Osprey, the brand is maintaining its leading share in U.S. technical packs even as that category softened. Osprey continues to extend into exciting new adjacencies. A great example that is rooted in consumer obsession is Osprey's new photography accessories line. After years of consumers asking us for photography gear, and extensive research and testing by Osprey, we launched our new photography accessories line in July. The line is built around the PhotoLid, an innovative padded camera case that support active photographers and content creators and designed to replace the removable top lid on most backpacks, while also offering accessible and protective storage for photogear. The new line has received strong consumer engagement and a tremendous response from the industry, earning Gear Junkie's Best in Show award from the Outdoor Market Alliance Show. In Everyday and Lifestyle packs, Osprey is having strong success with its daylight line, which is driven by new color designs, Osprey's high-quality materials and durability, and an affordable price point that caters to consumers in the current economic environment. This line continues to offer extended distribution opportunities for the brand. Now turning to Beauty & Wellness. Our Wellness business performed above our expectations with particular strength in fans and thermometry. As widely noted by the media, illness rates in the U.S. increased through July and much of August, and both Braun and Vicks thermometers saw higher POS. Fiscal year-to-date, while the thermometry category overall has remained relatively flat, Braun and Vicks have outperformed and gained share. They remain the number one and number two brands in the U.S., respectively. We also gained new or expanded distribution on Braun thermometers at CBS, Costco, and Walmart, in addition to Braun blood pressure monitors in Walmart. In Humidification, while the category remains soft, Vicks has maintained its number one share position. As we enter the peak cough, cold, and flu season, our inventory is well-positioned to serve customers and consumers as the season progresses. In water filtration, we are also seeing positive POS for PUR at Walmart, where the brand has been growing its presence. For Beauty, we continue to see softer POS across the brand portfolio and are taking actions to revitalize the brands and lean in where we see meaningful opportunities, leveraging consumer insights and our new brand-building frameworks. We also recently added new leadership with fresh perspective to help set this business up for long-term success. I mentioned the new Drybar our marketing campaign last quarter as an example of where we are evolving our marketing content and targeting with the support of our marketing center of excellence. We began the rollout of that new Drybar Polyglamorous campaign in July. This is a bold and fun repositioning of the brand that focuses on Drybar's more than 80 hairstyling products and complementary tools that allow consumers to dabble, tease, and play. The campaign has been very well received with social media engagement over twice the historic rate. We continue to see market opportunity for our hair products. We are pleased that Curlsmith is gaining market share in the fast-growing Prestige Hair Liquids category fiscal year-to-date. This quarter Curlsmith launched Shake & Shine Refresh Mist, which is crafted to refresh, moisturize, and define curls to extend the result of a wash day. In addition, Curlsmith earned an Allure Best Beauty of 2024 Award for Frizz Control Cleanser and Frizz Control Duo Conditioner. Last quarter, we extended our popular Drybar Liquid Glass product line, and we followed that up this quarter with additions to our thickening line, Drybar Big Brew. Revlon remains the unit share leader in hot air stylers fiscal year-to-date, and we have sold three times more Revlon One-Step Volumizers than the next largest competitive item. This month, we launched a new marketing campaign to appeal to savvy consumers who want salon-quality results without breaking the bank. The value reframe highlights that on average, Revlon retails for a tenth of the price of a Prestige competitor for similar results. We also continue to see strong momentum with the Revlon portfolio at Walmart, where consumers appreciate great care tools at accessible price points. Internationally, our businesses performed well with sales up almost 5% and all key regions contributing to the positive growth. Home & Outdoor outperformed our expectations and grew in all key international markets, driven by expanded distribution and greater collaboration between the brand and sales teams. In the U.K., you'll find a Drybar pop-up not only in Boots Battersea in London, but also onboard the Harrods tour bus as part of an exclusive multi-branded campaign where consumers were treated to a styling. Curlsmith launched in select Sephora and Boots stores in the U.K. and Hydro Flask expanded into GO Outdoors flagship stores. OXO has expanded at John Lewis, Leeds, in the U.K., has a beautiful pop-up in BHV Marais, one of Paris' most famous department stores in the heart of the city, and expanded its retail footprint in Japan. Osprey is well represented in Germany with a large display at Sport Schuster, Munich's leading sporting goods retailer. These are just a few examples of how we are increasing our global footprint. Stepping back, I remain confident that the reset and revitalized building blocks we discussed last quarter will prove to be a solid foundation for the future, but we know that change of this magnitude takes time. We remain committed to our strategic choices, growing our portfolio through consumer obsession, being and winning where our shoppers shop, fully leveraging our scale and assets, and embracing next-level data and analytics in everything we do. We are making significant progress on the road back to sustainable long-term top line growth and you heard evidence of that today. I want to thank our exceptional global associates across Helen of Troy for their dedication and passion for our company and brands. Now I will turn it over to Brian. Brian Grass: Thank you, Noel. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report second quarter results that were slightly above the high end of our expectations for net sales, adjusted EPS, and adjusted EBITDA. As Noel mentioned, we substantially completed the remediation efforts related to the automation system at our Tennessee distribution facility with minimal impact to sales in the quarter. We believe that we are now in a position to achieve targeted efficiency levels by the end of fiscal '25. We also rightsized our cost structure in line with our fiscal '25 net sales expectations, while maintaining our planned incremental growth investment, an increase of approximately 165 basis points year-over-year in the second quarter. While we know we have more work to do to achieve our long-term goals, we believe these results represent solid progress considering the executional challenges we overcame in the quarter. I'll now move on to a more detailed discussion of our second quarter results. Consolidated net sales declined 3.5%, slightly ahead of our expectations as the second quarter sales impact from automation challenges at our Tennessee distribution facility were less than originally expected. The sales decrease was primarily due to a decline in Beauty & Wellness, reflecting lower sales of hair appliances, air purifiers, and humidifiers, primarily driven by softer consumer demand, reduced replenishment from retail customers, and a strong competitive environment in hair appliances and air purification. Home & Outdoor grew almost 1% year-over-year, primarily due to improving trends in OXO and Hydro Flask, partially offset by a slight decline in Osprey. Our International business continues to perform well with sales growth of almost 5%. Consolidated gross profit margin was 45.6%. The 110 basis point decrease was primarily due to a less favorable product and customer mix within Home & Outdoor and unfavorable inventory obsolescence expense year-over-year. These factors were partially offset by lower commodity and product costs, partly driven by Project Pegasus. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 7.3% compared to 9.5% in the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, operating margin decreased 290 basis points to 9.8%. The decrease was primarily driven by the planned incremental growth investment of 165 basis points I referred to earlier, and an estimated 85 basis point impact from additional costs associated with automation start-up issues in our new distribution facility. Decline also reflects the lower gross profit margin and the impact of unfavorable operating leverage. These factors were partially offset by lower overall personnel expense and the lower commodity and product costs I referred to earlier. On a segment basis, Home & Outdoor adjusted operating margin decreased 270 basis points to 15%, primarily due to unfavorable distribution center expense, a less favorable product and customer mix, and planned incremental growth investment. Adjusted operating margin for Beauty & Wellness decreased 350 basis points to 4.4%, primarily due to planned incremental growth investment, unfavorable inventory obsolescence expense year-over-year, and the impact of unfavorable operating leverage. Our tax rate in the second quarter was 22% compared to 17.9% last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the impact of our Barbados tax legislation enacted during the first quarter of fiscal '25, shifts in the mix of income in our various tax jurisdictions and an increase in tax expense for discrete items. Net income was $17 million or $0.74 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS was $1.21 per share, reflecting lower adjusted operating income and an increase in the adjusted effective tax rate, partially offset by lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding and a decrease in interest expense. Free cash flow was $39.7 million, an increase of $11.7 million year-over-year, but slightly below our expectations for the quarter due to higher working capital needs. We ended the second quarter with total debt of $713 million, a sequential decrease of $35 million compared to the first quarter. Our net leverage ratio was 2.34 times compared to 2.37 times at the end of the first quarter. At the end of the second quarter, our Board authorized the repurchase of $500 million of our outstanding stock in keeping with our intention to return capital to shareholders, not otherwise deployed for core business growth or strategic acquisitions. The authorization was approved as part of the Board's regular process of reviewing our capital allocation and existing authorization. Turning now to our outlook for fiscal '25, we are maintaining our expectations for consolidated net sales, adjusted EPS, and adjusted EBITDA, and have updated our expectations for sales by segment, free cash flow, and ending net leverage ratio. We remain cautious as external headwinds of increased promotional activity, softer and more variable retail replenishment, and macro pressure and uncertainty remain. While the Federal Reserve's move to begin lowering interest rates will likely provide relief for some, we believe that the benefit will take some time to cycle through to many consumers. We also expect a year-over-year headwind from a shorter holiday shopping season between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. We continue to expect net sales between $1.885 billion and $1.935 billion, which implies a decline of 6% to 3.5%. This includes the unfavorable impact to net sales of approximately $8 million due to the shipping disruption from the automation startup issues at our distribution facility and the Curlsmith ERP integration challenges in the first quarter. In terms of our net sales outlook by segment, we now expect a Home & Outdoor decline of 2.3% to growth of 1.4%, which includes the impact of shipping disruption in our Tennessee distribution facility during the first quarter, and a Beauty & Wellness decline of 9% to 7.5%, which continues to include a year-over-year headwind of approximately 1% related to the expiration of an out-license relationship with respect to one of our Wellness brands. We continue to expect GAAP diluted EPS of $4.69 to $5.45 for the full year and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $7 to $7.50, which implies an adjusted diluted EPS decline of 21.4% to 15.8%. We continue to expect full-year adjusted EBITDA of $287 million to $297 million, which implies margin compression of approximately 150 basis points to 160 basis points year-over-year with approximately 50 basis points coming from the automation start-up issues at our distribution facility. We continue to incrementally invest back into product innovation and marketing for the long-term health of our business and our brands and continue to plan for a year-over-year increase in growth investment spending of roughly 100 basis points. We continue to expect some gross margin compression given our expectation of a more promotional environment and a less favorable sales mix. However, we still expect to expand gross margin year-over-year due to Project Pegasus. Finally, we anticipate lower operating leverage from the decline in revenue, which we expect to be offset by the rightsizing of our cost structure that we began to implement in the second quarter. Our first quarter interest expense outlook included the expectation of 225 basis point reductions for the remainder of fiscal '25, which now largely aligns with the Fed's 50 basis point reduction in September, and we have assumed no further rate reductions for the remainder of fiscal '25. As such, our full-year interest expense expectations remain unchanged. We expect a GAAP effective tax rate range of 27.3% to 29.5% for the full fiscal year and a non-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate range of 20.7% to 21.3%. We now expect capital and intangible asset expenditures of between $32 million and $37 million for fiscal '25, which includes remaining equipment and technology of $11 million to $12 million associated with our Tennessee distribution facility. We now expect free cash flow in the range of $180 million to $200 million, which implies a free cash flow yield of 12.7% to 14.1% using Monday's closing share price. Our lower free cash flow expectations for fiscal '25 reflect a slower start to the year and revised estimates for working capital and CapEx needs to support the continued improvement in our operating trends and opportunities we see for the remainder of the year. We now expect net leverage ratio as defined in our credit agreement to be between 1.9 times and 1.8 times by the end of fiscal '25. In terms of cadence, for the third quarter of fiscal '25, we expect net sales decline in the range of 4.5% to 1% year-over-year and adjusted diluted EPS decline in the range of 10% to 3% year-over-year. As we look towards fiscal '26, we thought it beneficial to provide an update on our efforts to diversify our production outside of China and mitigate the impact of potential incremental tariffs in the future. With the first step of this strategy, we have reduced our exposure to incremental tariffs to a range of 25% to 30% of consolidated cost of goods sold. We are now launching the second step of our strategy, which targets a further reduction to our exposure by the end of fiscal '26. We plan to share more on this important initiative when we provide our fiscal '26 outlook this coming April. Finally, I'd like to update you on the process to divest one of our businesses. After a thorough and rigorous process that included both strategic and private equity bidders, we have decided to put the process on hold until further notice. We feel the valuation and structure of the offers we received were not reflective of the current health of the brand and future potential of the business. Year-to-date, the business has performed largely in line with expectations. We believe there is potential to further improve its performance. We intend to continue to consistently evaluate our portfolio to ensure our assets position us for long-term success. In closing, I am pleased with the progress we are making to reset and revitalize our business in fiscal '25 and believe this will position us well to improve our core and achieve our long-term objectives. Our Project Pegasus initiatives are on track and are fueling a step-level increase in brand and innovation investment, and we have invested more in data-driven decision making and capabilities to leverage that investment more efficiently. We will continue to use our free cash flow to deploy capital using a balanced approach, which we believe can drive significant accretion, whether we pay down debt, repurchase our shares, or make strategic acquisition. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator. Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Peter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. Maybe my first question was just -- I wanted to ask about kind of the quarter and the path from here. Maybe just to start, you both outlined a lot of great things that are going on across the portfolio, but when you think about the upside in the quarter, is there a way to parse out how much of that was the category coming in better versus maybe some of the actions in innovation you outlined? And then as we look ahead, what's really embedded from a category perspective? Last quarter, I think it was -- or it seemed you more or less were anticipating what you saw in May was going to hold. Can you maybe share what you -- what's kind of embedded in the outlook today from a category standpoint? Noel Geoffroy: Yes. Thanks, Peter. Great to hear from you. So I would say, overall, as we look at kind of the balance of the year and the impact of our performance versus the categories, there's a little bit of both, but I would say, as I highlighted in my remarks, I'm really pleased with some of the performance that we're seeing on some of our brands. We've been hard at work, putting brand-building frameworks in place, really understanding our target consumer, putting the incremental investment behind the brands, you're seeing a lot of new products come out that I touched on today from the Hydro Flask, Travel Bottle, the Rapid Brewer from OXO, Big Brew extensions that are performing well, Curlsmith's new products that are coming out, so really across the portfolio, we've got a lot of new products and they're making an impact. Distribution gains or another, I talked about Hydro Flask performing and doing well in Costco. We continue to be really pleased with the performance of OXO in Walmart. And so I'm pleased that we're seeing the results start to come through from the work we've been doing across all of our portfolio. Category-wise, I would say, it's a mixed bag, we play across a lot of categories. So we've got some categories where we still see a little bit of softness, like a dry food storage, for example, some have flattened out, like kitchen utensils. Thermometers, as I mentioned in my remarks, has flattened out. A little bit of softness still in technical packs. I would say, the outdoor -- kind of the core outdoor category is still a little bit soft, but we're holding share there, our leadership share in technical packs. So if I was going to attribute it to anything, I'd say, our performance is improving. Brian Grass: And I'd just add, Peter, that in terms of assumptions for the remainder of the year, we do attempt to update our category view every quarter, and we did do that, but I would say, it was very similar to the view that we had last quarter. So, no -- I'd say no major change being driven from category assumptions. Peter Grom: Okay. That's super helpful. And then just on the buyback, and I apologize if I missed this, but just any thoughts on how you're thinking about timing? Is this something you're looking to complete in a relatively short timeframe here, or is this more of a longer-term program? Brian Grass: No, I'd say there's no views on it really. This was really just good housekeeping of the Board, refreshing our authorization, because it had -- it was expiring at the end of August. And so it was really a refresh of our authorization and I'm getting it back to the level that we kind of historically set them at and then we'll look to execute those as we see opportunities going forward. So no burning views and really just good housekeeping. Peter Grom: Got it. Thanks so much. I'll pass it on. Sabrina McKee: Thanks, Peter. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question. Rupesh Parikh: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to go back to the implied outlook for the back half of the year. Given the Q2 be -- it would imply that maybe the back half is slightly softer on sales and EPS, so I just want to get a sense of whether -- what's driving that or maybe if it's just embedding more conservatism. Noel Geoffroy: Yes, Rupesh. Good to hear from you. So, look, when we looked at quarter two, we saw less of a revenue impact from the Tennessee Distribution Center than we anticipated as Brian called out in his remarks. And so that helped us in the quarter and then we didn't feel it was enough to flow through from there. That's really the difference. Brian, anything you want to add? Brian Grass: Yes. I would say, we really exceeded our -- the high-end of our expectations by about $4 million and we had planned for approximately $5 million of disruption from the distribution center. So I would say, all in, we kind of felt like it was more of a met expectations in that regard and really not enough for us to consider raising our guidance for the second half. Rupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just my follow-up question. Just as we look at the Beauty category, clearly, it's gotten more competitive out there, maybe some -- there's also some macro headwinds with the consumer there. What would you say are the key efforts to drive that category back to growth? And how do you guys think about timing, like is this something that could take a few quarters to drive improvements or just any more color there in terms of efforts and potential timing of a turn in the Beauty category? Noel Geoffroy: Yes. I would say, in Beauty, a few things. One, it started for me with really doing the foundational brand-building framework work that we did, including that detailed quantitative category segmentation of consumers. So we really understand who the consumers are, what our segments are and how do we position our portfolio of brands against those different consumer segments. And so that foundation -- we completed kind of at the start of the year and now the brands are using those frameworks and using all of that insights to build their plans and kind of continue to move forward. We did bring in some new leadership in Beauty & Wellness for some fresh perspective. We've had a lot of meetings with some of our key retailers. So we're getting customer and buyer input on what they're seeing, what they're looking for. And I think you're already seeing some of the fruits of all that labor come into the market that I talked about today. Curlsmith, a real bright spot, really pleased with how that's performing growing share, in a growing -- a high growing category, lot of new products that are really hitting the marketing award, getting a lot of positive consumer feedback. On Drybar, the liquids are -- some of the liquid extensions are a bright spot like Big Brew that I commented on, really hitting on that consumer insight of thinning hair, with the power claim of 150% volume producing with Big Brew, so that's standing out. The Revlon Volumizer, we just launched some value reframing, which came directly from that brand-building framework, understanding that there's a group of consumers out there who are value-seeking right now, right? They want that great strong quality performance, but they don't want it to break the bank. So they're looking for a product like our Revlon One-Step. It's still the -- Revlon is the share leader in hot air stylers and that particular item still sells more -- three times more than the next largest competitor. So it's really putting our marketing out there, so the consumer can choose us more often. So those will be the things that we continue to do. We've got some more innovation in the pipeline. I think there's something we're excited about towards the end of the year that will come out from a new product standpoint, but those are going to be the steps, right? It's the marketing, it's the new products, it's positioning our brands in the marketplace with our retail partners effectively. Rupesh Parikh: Great. Thank you for all the color and best of luck. Noel Geoffroy: Thanks, Rupesh. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question. Robert Labick: Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to kind of follow up on what you were just saying there. You've increased brand investment, but you've also increased investment in data and analytics capabilities. Can you like tell us what are the key learnings from this increased data and analytics so far? And what have you done and what have you changed in your processes or your outlook, investment, et cetera, as a result of the learnings from the data and analytics capabilities you now have? Noel Geoffroy: Yes. Thanks, Bob. That's been a really big focus for me. I really felt that we will be better by using data and analytics to inform everything we do, and so it started with the foundational consumer segmentation and understanding in the brand-building framework so that we're really clear going into our planning who were looking to reach and who is sort of that high-growth prospect consumer segment by brand. And then as we're allocating the incremental media that Project Pegasus helped generate, it's using that insight to go after the right target audience, and then we did a very robust first-time-ever marketing mix model that allows us to understand our return on ad spend across all the brands in our portfolio, but also importantly, every single tactic that we use. So we're able to optimize our spend across the brand portfolio, but also importantly across the tactics. So we can look across upper and lower funnel and really optimize against that return on investment and the reach that we're looking to get. So it's really a completely new way of going to market for Helen of Troy, who we're talking to and then how we're measuring the impact of that spend. Robert Labick: Okay. Great. And then, Brian, I think you touched on the shorter holiday season, I guess, with later Thanksgiving and stuff. Could you give us a sense of how the retail environment is setting up right now versus, I guess, expectations and versus prior years? Brian Grass: Yes. I mean, there is an expectation of a softer environment, which I would say we kind of had for the remainder of the year before we really got to the holiday season. So I would say the expectations are more value-oriented and maybe a little bit softer, but I feel like we had that embedded in our expectations already. Robert Labick: Okay. Great. Thank you. Noel Geoffroy: Thanks, Bob. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Olivia Tong: Great. Thanks. Good morning. You had mentioned that several categories have been normalizing now, for example, OXO. So can you talk about how do you expect that to manifest? Are you advertising more behind them? Is there more shelf space either in brick-and-mortar or more focus online on those categories? And how do we think about that in light of the more challenging macros, particularly as it relates to promotional levels in your key categories and whether retailers are going to be tighter on inventory near term? Noel Geoffroy: Yes. Thanks, Olivia. So I would say, when it comes to the normalizing categories, those are really the ones that were impacted by COVID. So if you think about kitchen utensils, we were still kind of continuing to see that category decline as we were coming off of the COVID -- kind of the COVID surge of that particular product line. Now, I would say, it's acting more normally. On a go-forward basis, a category like kitchen utensils and really a lot of OXO gets driven by new home formation, back-to-school meal prep, holiday meal preps, things like that. It becomes more of those normal activities. I will say right now, we're also impacted on OXO by eating in or dining out how consumers choose to kind of spend their money that way. So as consumers are being a little bit more diligent about how they're spending if they choose to eat out a bit less in the home more, that's a positive for a brand like OXO. Thermometer was another one that had a big normalization. Air purifier is a big normalization post-COVID. So I think, those -- a couple of them are still normalizing. I would say, air is still a little bit normalization, hasn't fully occurred yet, similar on dry food storage, that's another one from a category standpoint that's still normalizing. I think in terms of retail inventory, I mean, look, we don't see anything hugely unusual right now from a retail inventory standpoint. The thing that we see is the retailers who are maybe performing a little bit less well in the marketplace are using different techniques to manage their inventory quarter-to-quarter, so we've got a little bit less visibility than maybe we have in the past. They tend to manage it at a total store level versus category-by-category. And so those are things that we see from time to time that impact us that can be a little bit surprising, but that -- otherwise, I don't see a huge inventory issue in the retail marketplace right now. Olivia Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then just thinking about the guide and maybe you can help us understand sort of the building blocks to get from one end of the range to the other now that you are at the halfway point of the year. Likely, you have some fairly reasonable visibility into holidays, recognizing, of course, a shortened holiday period this year versus last year, but just any sort of building blocks around one end to the other? Thanks. Brian Grass: So you're talking about what would change between the high end and the low end of our guidance, Olivia? Olivia Tong: Basically just trying to understand what the parameters are to get to the high end of the outlook versus the lower end of your outlook given that... Brian Grass: Okay. Olivia Tong: Presumably we know what holiday looks like already and a couple of other things. Brian Grass: Okay, that helps. Yes, I would say that the building blocks on the high end of our guidance would be, what we have clear line of sight to, and as we've said before, we've taken a hard look at POS trends and tried to assume that the current trends, not try -- assume that current trends would remain consistent throughout the remainder of the year. I would really say the big thing that would change from there would be POS trends declining. So if POS trends were to decline from where they were, then that would be a factor that would put us more towards the lower end of the range, but that's really it. I would say, we've not leaned forward on opportunities that we didn't have line of sight on with respect to our high end of our outlook, so that's there. In the POS, we've assumed -- current POS trends, if they were slightly lower or lower, that could pull us down closer towards the lower end of the range. But that's really it, because we haven't really made leaning forward assumptions with respect to the incremental building blocks such as distribution gains or new product innovation or even our return on investment from our marketing spend. We feel good about the data we have to support that. And so we think that's a tangible building block. So I think it really have to be a major change in trend or a major change in the macro environment. Noel, do you want to add anything? Noel Geoffroy: No, I think that's right. And as we've said before, the biggest tangible building block in the back half is distribution, followed by, I would say, some incremental innovation and then the marketing spend. Olivia Tong: Got it. Thank you so much. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Linda Bolton Weiser: Yes. Hi, thank you. So I think originally, if we go back to this original expectations about the cadence of growth or decline or whatever, the original, I guess, idea was that you had gained a lot of distribution in the second half of 2024, and that benefit would carry on into the first half. Is there any way to quantify -- despite all this other noise that occurred from the DC implementation, is there any way to quantify that distribution benefit in the first half of your fiscal? And then is the distribution benefit in the second half kind of going to be bigger or smaller than what you've already had, if you can understand what I'm asking? Thank you. Brian Grass: Yes. Just to answer the second question first, the distribution gains we are getting in the second half of this year should be bigger than the carry-forward gains from the prior year that impacted the first half of this year. So we are -- we have secured incrementally more distribution, I would say, that we'll apply new distribution, that we will apply to fiscal year '25 than we had secured in fiscal year '24. And we haven't really sized it. So I would not be comfortable giving that right now. We haven't really sized it publicly. And so we have talked about the dimensionality of the new distribution that we have for fiscal year '25. But with respect to '24 and its carryover impact on fiscal '25, we haven't really disclosed that. But I will tell you that the fiscal '25 gains are bigger than fiscal '24. Linda Bolton Weiser: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, I was just curious about -- in our store checks, when we checked at the Ulta within Target, it's sort of a limited selection of brands. It's not a huge array like a regular Ulta store, but we did notice that your Drybar and your Curlsmith had very nice shelf space there. So can you talk about that? And is that like a benefit to the whole growth rate? I mean, does it move the needle at all, or just can you talk about sort of that positioning within Ulta in Target? Thanks. Noel Geoffroy: Yes. Thanks, Linda. I would say, look, physical availability, so having our brands is widely available in front of as many shoppers as possible, is a benefit in my view, so I think the Ulta in Target helps to do that. It brings some of our premium prestige liquids like Curlsmith and Drybar. Even in the limited assortment that's there, as you mentioned, I see this as a positive thing. There's just -- there's a lot of people -- a lot of footfall going through Target, and so having that store within a store there and being part of that assortment is a positive. Whether or not it's a needle mover, I don't know that we break it out in a way to be able to see specifically what's coming from one versus the other, it's all Ulta for us. But I just subjectively would say, I think it's a great thing for our brands and it allows a brand like Curlsmith to be in front of shoppers at Target within that store within store. So all positive from my perspective. And similarly, the Sephora within Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), it's a similar idea. Linda Bolton Weiser: Okay. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question. Susan Anderson: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if maybe you can give some thoughts just kind of going into the holiday season how you're expecting consumer spending? Do you expect them to -- do you expect it to be similar to what we saw all year on spend on discretionary items? And then also maybe if you could just talk about the promotional cadence year-over-year that you're expecting and just how you're planning for the season? Thanks. Noel Geoffroy: Yes. Thanks, Susan. I would say, in general, on holidays, we talked about there's one last week. I think prime days are happening kind of right now, so I think that's going to give us some indication. It's a little bit of a run-up to the holidays to see where consumers are leaning in and what they're looking at. I continue to think everything we hear is, the consumer balance sheet continues to be challenged. And so I think consumers are spending, but they're being choosy on where and how they spend their money. And I think it will be similar in the holiday season. They're going to look for items that really meet a specific need or items that they really think will bring delight to who they're giving the gifts to. And so that's -- I think that kind of macro sentiment is going to carry-over into the holiday. I think promotion-wise, again, consumers are looking for value. What I really see is where consumers are shopping. So you're seeing customers and retailers like Walmart, Costco doing really well and those are the retailers that consumers think of when they think, I'm getting a good value when I'm shopping in those places or they're interested in events like Prime Day and things like that. When it comes to our promotional planning, we have promotional plans for all of our brands across the year kind of coming into the year. And to those key tentpole events and those key windows are things that we'll continue to support. I don't see us doing anything dramatically different in terms of depth of discount. I would say, for example, in the Prime Days right now, our breadth of assortment is a little bit broader than what we've done in the past. So Osprey is participating for the first time. But a lot of that is more because Osprey is diversifying into adjacent categories like the daypacks, the everyday lifestyle packs. And so we've got items that make sense to participate there and it's an important tentpole event. So I see us continuing to look at -- as our brands expand into these categories, where are these opportunities to participate in tentpole events, but I don't see us doing major depth discounts in light of where the consumer is right now. Susan Anderson: Okay, great. That was very helpful. Maybe if I could just add one more. If you could talk about the cadence of gross margin, I guess, between the third and fourth quarter in the back half. Are you expecting any differences there? Maybe you could just talk about the puts and takes also versus the first half? Thanks. Brian Grass: Yes, I would say just if you compare Q2, our gross margin was below our expectations and there were a couple things going on there that we wouldn't necessarily expect to repeat like year-over-year inventory obsolescence and then a little bit of margin compression that we did see in Q2 because we launched at Costco. We had lower DTC, which I think is going to normalize, and then we had a little bit higher closeouts. So those all weighed on the margin, but I expect that to normalize and get back more towards a prior year and maybe slightly above prior year in the second half. And sorry, what was the second question? Susan Anderson: That was it. Well, I guess just the difference between the first half and then the third and fourth quarter as well. Brian Grass: Okay. Yes, I'd say third and fourth quarter are very similar, and both pretty consistent with prior year, maybe slightly above. Susan Anderson: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Good luck for the rest of the year. Brian Grass: Thank you. Noel Geoffroy: Thanks, Susan. Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to management for any final comments. Noel Geoffroy: Thank you all for joining us today as we share the significant progress we are making to reset and revitalize our business this fiscal year. We believe we're taking the right steps on the path to sustainable long-term top line growth, and we really look forward to updating you all on our progress on future calls. Thanks so much. Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Title: Macro Guru Hugh Hendry Betting on Bitcoin (BTC) and Lower Interest Rates for 2025 – Here’s Why

Hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry is betting on Bitcoin (BTC) and low interest rates next year. Hendry says there “always two ever-present tail risks” in a short volatility investment strategy, which aims to profit off decreases in market volatility by selling options. “Do you buy the call option that the Mag-7 become capitalized at 100% of GDP or that rates descend rapidly to the lower bound? That’s why I keep hammering on about observing where stock levels are on the day of the next cut. I’m running a barbell: long BTC and long calls on <2% Fed Funds at year end 2025 I am of course exposed to a tracking error, that stocks surge and bitcoin is flat or down on some idiosyncratic news. I’m content to run that risk.” Mag-7 refers to the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL; GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). Hendry also compares Bitcoin’s size to the Invesco QQQ, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the Nasdaq-100 Index. “BTC is everyone’s phantom, good or bad. In reality, its MASS renders it irrelevant to this conversation but highly attractive for upside consideration. In the game of Newton’s Cradle, MASS is paramount today, it’s the outlier. BTC’s capitalization is just $1 trillion. QQQ is $42 trillion. The Qs, or rather the $13 trillion in the Mag-7, are therefore the only consideration. Bank stock lending renders the robustness of that valuation paramount. If that melts, the credit unravels, the margin call is immense. Perhaps doesn’t happen, but if I were a bank I’d be circumspect about the moneyness of that collateral. I’d be trying to contra-cyclically reduce my assets, markets and their liquidity permitting. By moneyness I mean the pledged assets’ proximity to a t-bill. Your t-bill ain’t gonna lose 83% of its value over the next 18 months. Bur stocks capitalized at these vaunted levels vis-a-vis GDP have periodically suffered such reversals.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: GOOGL vs. META: Which AI/Big Data Stock Is Better?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/googl-vs-meta-ai-big-064609819.html
Time Published: 2024-10-10T06:46:09Z

In this piece, I evaluated two AI/Big Data stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META). A closer look suggests bullish ratings for both, although a clear winner emerges. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, generates revenue from online advertising, sales of apps and content on Google Play and YouTube, and fees on cloud services and other licensing revenue. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, also generates revenue from online advertising. Shares of Alphabet have tumbled 12% over the last three months, bringing their year-to-date gain to 20%, which accounts for nearly all of the 21% one-year return. In contrast, Meta Platforms stock is up 12% over the last three months for a year-to-date jump of 69% and a one-year bounce of 88%. The two companies’ equally opposite three-month performances create a setup for an interesting matchup, as outlined below. At a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.5x, there’s no ignoring the fact that Alphabet is cheap. While concerns about generative AI could threaten the technology giant, the current P/E is just too cheap to ignore, suggesting a bullish view is in order. Notably, advertising still accounts for the lion’s share of Alphabet’s quarterly revenue, including $64.6 billion of the $84.7 billion in total revenue. Google Search alone accounted for $48.5 billion of total revenue. Thus, it’s easy to see why some might give credence to the concerns raised by a fund manager last week. However, I would suggest that his view might be a bit short-sighted, especially since Search revenue is still growing. At the 2024 Quality-Growth Conference last week, Stephen Yiu of Blue Whale Capital explained why he’s bearish on Alphabet right now. He expects generative AI to significantly change Alphabet’s business model, although he does see some upside left in the near term. Nonetheless, he maintains a negative view due to signs of a market share decline from Google Search, which once held a 90% share. Furthermore, Alphabet’s AI model, Gemini, has yet to meet the expectations set by competing models. Despite Yiu’s longer-term concerns for Alphabet, this looks like a buy-the-dip opportunity. On a P/E basis, the shares have been range-bound since about April 2023. However, they’re currently at the bottom of the valuation range, suggesting another leg up could be in the offing soon. Even if Alphabet does enter a period of struggle, as Yiu maintains, this company isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. In short, Alphabet is one of those stocks that’s good to buy and hold for the long term, although the size of the position in your portfolio might fluctuate based on valuation. Thus, I would recommend a small position right now if you don’t already have one, potentially with plans to add a few more shares if you already have a position. After all, Alphabet has more than doubled over the past five years, rising 174%. Additionally, should Gemini deliver positive surprises, Alphabet shares will rise further, potentially breaking out of their current range. We’re already starting to see signs of this with the integration into Google Search and the recent Gemini at Work event, which covered a range of AI use cases for enterprises. Alphabet has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, nine Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $200.29, the average Alphabet stock price target implies upside potential of 21.85%. See more GOOGL analyst ratings At a P/E of 30x, Meta Platforms is trading at a premium to Alphabet, and it’s on the rise after hitting bottom at around 25.5x in early August. Meta has been rangebound for about a year or so on a P/E basis and is approaching the middle of that range. Nonetheless, a long-term bullish view looks appropriate. Meta Platforms is less diversified than Alphabet, capturing 98% of its revenue from advertising in the second quarter. This could prevent a problem in the event that digital advertising goes south, though that looks doubtful. Yiu also commented on Meta Platforms, picking it as his top Magnificent Seven stock aside from NVIDIA (NVDA). He believes that Meta has greater access to personal information than Alphabet, thanks to the interactions occurring across its various platforms. He noted that this provides more personal information about individuals than just searching for things on Google. Further, Yiu mentioned that he believes ads on Meta Platforms will become more personalized through generative AI, which he expects to have a greater impact on Meta than on Alphabet. He argues that personal interactions are more likely to drive immediate purchase decisions compared to Google searches. Additionally, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg supported Yiu’s remarks, stating that AI will allow Meta to offer even more tailored advertisements. I would agree with Yiu on these points, but I don’t think Meta will enjoy greater benefits from AI than Alphabet, especially over the long term. Notably, Meta’s ad revenue growth rate reached 22% in the second quarter, double that of Google’s growth rate. However, it’s important to consider that Alphabet’s growth rate was based on a much larger scale versus Meta’s total revenue of $39.1 billion for Q2. Meta Platforms has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $607.92, the average Meta Platforms stock price target implies downside potential of 2.54%. See more META analyst ratings Although both Alphabet and Meta Platforms receive bullish ratings, Alphabet is the clear winner here. Google Cloud revenues continued to rise sequentially, surpassing $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in the second quarter. The Cloud division accounts for Alphabet’s AI revenue, which is critical because AI is already starting to cover for the drop in ad revenue. On the other hand, Meta Platforms is trading at a premium to Alphabet, and it’s verging on overbought territory with a Relative Strength Index of 69.4. Ultimately, I expect Alphabet and Meta to both capture significant AI revenues. However, Alphabet takes the crown this time around due to valuation and the fact that it was able to put an actual number on AI-related revenue, while Meta just talked about AI making a difference in its revenue growth.

Title: Amazon Unveils AI Tool To Help Drivers Find Packages Faster

The announcement underscores Amazon's shifting priorities under new CEO Andy Jassy Amazon.com Inc. unveiled a new artificial intelligence tool designed to solve a major pain point in its quick delivery apparatus: drivers rummaging through cluttered vans at each stop searching for packages. The technology projects a green circle on packages to be delivered at each stop and red Xs on those to be delivered later, Amazon said Wednesday at a Nashville media event focused on its logistics and online shopping initiatives. Called Vision Assisted Package Retrieval and in development since 2020, the tool will be deployed in 1,000 Amazon vans next year and will shorten the typical delivery route by about 30 minutes, the company said. The tool uses computer-vision technology initially developed in Amazon warehouses to identify products without using barcode scanners. The technology was adapted for vans' cramped cargo areas and integrated with delivery-route navigation software. "Delivery drivers will no longer have to spend time organizing packages by stops, reading labels or manually checking key identifiers like a customer's name or address to ensure they have the right packages," Amazon said in a release. "They simply have to look for VAPR's green light, grab and go." The announcement underscores Amazon's shifting priorities under Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who assumed the role from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Bezos wowed the media with grandiose announcements that looked far into the future, such as fleets of autonomous delivery drones - a project still in the testing phase more than a decade after he announced it. Under Jassy, who steered the company through layoffs and shuttered dozens of moonshot projects, the focus is on near-term efforts to shave costs and make Amazon's low-margin e-commerce business more appealing to Wall Street investors prone to fret about slim profits. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The Seattle-based company relies on a network of small businesses that use 100,000 vans and employ 390,000 drivers to deliver packages. By reducing delivery times, Amazon can limit what it has to pay these delivery service partners, which typically hire drivers paid by the hour.

Title: Oracle Price Levels to Watch as Stock Sets Record High
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/oracle-price-levels-to-watch-as-stock-sets-record-high-8726067
Time Published: 2024-10-10T02:49:30Z
Full Content:
Oracle (ORCL) shares hit a record high Wednesday following a report that ChatGPT maker OpenAI is looking beyond Microsoft (MSFT) to supply servers, paving the way for a potential new partnership with the enterprise software giant. Tech industry focused publication The Information reported that OpenAI’s leadership recently told staff that the company planned to take on a larger role in securing data centers and artificial intelligence (AI) chips, rather than relying exclusively on Microsoft. In June, the company rented Oracle servers at a new data center in Texas with limited input from Microsoft, according to the report. At the time, OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman said that the software company’s Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) would allow it to scale, while Oracle CEO Larry Ellison pointed out that AI leaders such as OpenAI are turning to the company for its fast, cost-effective AI infrastructure. Oracle shares have surged around 25% in the past month and gained nearly 70% year-to-date through Wednesday’s close, boosted in part by a recent multicloud partnership with Amazon’s (AMZN) cloud business. The stock rose 2.3% to close Wednesday's session at $178.29, after hitting an all-time high of $178.61. Below, we take a closer look at Oracle's weekly chart and use technical analysis to point out important price levels to watch out for. Oracle shares traded within a three-year rising wedge before staging a decisive volume-backed breakout above the pattern last month. Since that time, the stock has continued to trend sharply higher, though share turnover has decreased following the initial breakout. While, the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum, it also cautions of short-term overbought conditions with a reading above 80. It’s worth pointing out that the last time the indicator flashed above this threshold in June last year, the stock underwent a correction of around 22% over the following six months. We’ll now identify three important lower chart area that could come into play during pullbacks and use a bars pattern to project a price target if the stock continues its long-term uptrend. The first location to monitor sits around $146, an area on the chart where the shares could find initial support around the July swing high and wedge pattern’s top trendline. Selling below this level could see the shares revisit the $127 level, a region just below the wedge’s lower trendline that would likely encounter support from multiple highs on the chart between June 2023 and May this year, which also closely aligns with the 2024 August low and upward sloping 50-week moving average (MA). A deeper correction could bring the psychological $100 round number into play. Investors would likely look for buying opportunities in this area near the closely-watched 200-week MA and prominent peaks and troughs that formed on the chart from October 2021 to December last year. A bars pattern uses historical trends to predict future moves. To apply this technique on Oracle’s chart, we take the stock’s trend higher from October 2022 to June last year and overlay it from the August low, which projects a price target of around $250. We selected this earlier trending period because it began from the rising wedge’s lower trendline, similar to how the stock’s current move higher started. Interestingly, the prior trend played out over 36 weeks, meaning a comparable move could potentially last until early April if price history were to rhyme.

The previous YSR Congress Party Government in the state led by Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy never opposed the proposal to privatise VSP during 2019-24 and now had `no moral right’ to criticise the NDA Government in the State on the issue, he added.

Britannia Bel Foods, a key player in India’s cheese market, has taken a significant step in its growth journey by announcing the inauguration of its new cheese factory in Ranjangaon, Maharashtra. This facility will locally produce “Britannia The Laughing Cow” cheese products, deepening the joint venture between Britannia and France’s Bel Group, which began nearly two years ago.

An Independent Investigation Committee (IIC) constituted by the Board of Directors of ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEE), has found no irregularities in the functioning of the company. “The Committee also noted that the transactions (under investigation) did not adversely affect the Company or its shareholders. The mentioned transactions were found to be a part of normal course of business, and no material irregularities were reported within the same,” said a press release. In the order released on August 14 2023, SEBI confirmed that Goenka along with his father Subhash Chandra will not be allowed to hold the position of a Director or a KMP in ZEEL or any of its subsidiaries, while the market regulator completes its investigation on the matter. The order by the capital markets regulator came on the back of an investigation into allegations related to the appropriation of certain fixed deposits of Zee by Yes Bank for squaring off loans of related entities of Essel Group ‘ Listen to your employees. Listen to your customers Shut... the ef up. And do what they tell you.’ This was the mantra adopted by the maverick CEO of T-Mobile USA - John Legere, in delivering one of the most remarkable transformations of a company in corporate history. When he took the reigns of T-Mobile USA in 2012/13 it was a weak fourth player in USA with around 34 million wireless subscribers in an industry dominated by two giants – AT&T and Verizon with 78 and 98 million wireless subscribers respectively. The third player Sprint Nextel too had a wide lead over T-Mobile USA with 55 million subscribers.

This action could be a precursor to a rate cut as early as in the December 2024 bi-monthly monetary policy review. However, the six-member monetary policy committee (MPC), which has three new external members, chose by a majority of 5 out of 6 members to hold the policy repo rate steady at 6.50 per cent as the pace of disinflation has been slow and uneven. Only the newly appointed Nagesh Kumar voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points.

Full Content:
Kenneth Duda, the Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of Software Engineering at Arista Networks , Inc. (NYSE:ANET), has sold shares worth over $15 million according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The transactions, which took place on October 7, 2024, involved multiple sales at varying prices, resulting in a total sale value of approximately $15,778,727. The SEC filing indicates that Duda sold shares in a series of transactions. The sales were executed at weighted average prices ranging from $391.03 to $398.98. The total number of shares sold directly by Duda amounted to $7,893,864 worth, while an additional $6,315,089 worth of shares were sold indirectly through a children's trust. Shares sold by a foundation associated with Duda totaled $1,578,774. Investors often watch insider transactions such as these for signals about the company’s performance and insiders' confidence in the company's future. The transactions by Duda were conducted under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which allows insiders to set up a predetermined schedule to sell stocks at a time when they are not in possession of material non-public information, to avoid accusations of insider trading. Arista Networks, headquartered in Santa Clara, California, specializes in computer communications equipment and has been known for its cloud networking solutions. The filing also showed that Duda acquired 20,000 shares through an option exercise at a price of $17.085 per share, totaling $341,700. Following the sales, the SEC report detailed that Duda's direct ownership in the company decreased, although the exact number of shares retained has not been disclosed. As of the filing date, Kenneth Duda had not engaged in any buy transactions of Arista Networks stock. The company and Duda have not publicly commented on the sales as of yet. In other recent news, Arista Networks has been the center of attention due to a number of updates. The company reported a strong Q2 performance, with revenues hitting $1.69 billion, marking a 15.9% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by services and software support renewals. Goldman Sachs reiterated a Buy rating on Arista Networks, projecting approximately 20% revenue growth for 2024 and 2025. The firm also anticipated Arista to achieve its $750 million AI revenue target in 2025, thanks to the transition from pilot to production in significant AI cluster projects. In addition, Evercore ISI maintained its Outperform rating for Arista, based on the potential revenue opportunity from Meta (NASDAQ:META)'s development of a massive new AI model training cluster, which could result in a possible $250 million in revenue for Arista if they secure the contract. Deutsche Bank also maintained its Hold rating, suggesting a positive outlook for the company's growth potential through 2025. These recent developments highlight Arista Networks' strong market position and potential for continued growth. To provide additional context to Kenneth Duda's recent stock transactions, it's worth examining Arista Networks' current financial position and market performance. According to InvestingPro data, Arista Networks boasts a substantial market capitalization of $128.27 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the communications equipment industry. The company's stock has shown remarkable strength, with a 107.19% price total return over the past year. This impressive performance aligns with an InvestingPro Tip indicating that Arista Networks has been trading near its 52-week high, with the current price at 99.46% of that peak. Such robust stock performance might provide some context for insider selling, as executives may choose to realize gains after significant price appreciation. Financially, Arista Networks appears to be in a solid position. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that the company holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, suggesting financial stability. This is further supported by the fact that Arista's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, indicating a strong liquidity position. For investors seeking a deeper understanding of Arista Networks' financial health and market position, InvestingPro offers 17 additional tips, providing a comprehensive analysis of the company's strengths and potential areas of concern.

Title: Amazon unveils AI tool to help drivers find packages faster

Amazon.com Inc. unveiled a new artificial intelligence tool designed to solve a major pain point in its quick delivery apparatus: drivers rummaging through cluttered vans at each stop searching for packages. The technology projects a green circle on packages to be delivered at each stop and red Xs on those to be delivered later, Amazon said Wednesday at a Nashville media event focused on its logistics and online shopping initiatives. Called Vision Assisted Package Retrieval and in development since 2020, the tool will be deployed in 1,000 Amazon vans next year and will shorten the typical delivery route by about 30 minutes, the company said. The tool uses computer-vision technology initially developed in Amazon warehouses to identify products without using barcode scanners. The technology was adapted for vans’ cramped cargo areas and integrated with delivery-route navigation software. “Delivery drivers will no longer have to spend time organizing packages by stops, reading labels or manually checking key identifiers like a customer’s name or address to ensure they have the right packages,” Amazon said in a release. “They simply have to look for VAPR’s green light, grab and go.” The announcement underscores Amazon’s shifting priorities under Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who assumed the role from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Bezos wowed the media with grandiose announcements that looked far into the future, such as fleets of autonomous delivery drones — a project still in the testing phase more than a decade after he announced it. Under Jassy, who steered the company through layoffs and shuttered dozens of moonshot projects, the focus is on near-term efforts to shave costs and make Amazon’s low-margin e-commerce business more appealing to Wall Street investors prone to fret about slim profits. The Seattle-based company relies on a network of small businesses that use 100,000 vans and employ 390,000 drivers to deliver packages. By reducing delivery times, Amazon can limit what it has to pay these delivery service partners, which typically hire drivers paid by the hour.

Title: UBS ‘quantimental’ framework identifies a surprise U.S. company as its highest ranking stock
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/ubs-quantimental-framework-identifies-a-surprise-u-s-company-as-its-highest-ranking-stock/

United States growth companies are killing it, according to a report published today by Zurich-based UBS. Titled ‘Theme-ometer,’ the report includes a list of 20 companies that rank highest and 20 ranked lowest, based on the bank’s proprietary “quantimental stock selection framework” that breaks down company performance into four categories: the macro economic regime (R), the operating environment for earnings (E), the market assessment of valuations (V), and by sentiment (S). That’s REVS for short. Six of the top seven highest ranked companies to make the UBS list are from the U.S. They include Fortinet, a 24-year-old cybersecurity company that has grown explosively since Covid caused the work-from-home population to balloon. Its stock price grew by 34.25% over the past year alone, to $79.89 today. Only Madrid-based Endesa, an electric company in UBS’s EU Listed Eurozone Exposure theme out-ranked the other six U.S. companies. Of note, as with most bank research, UBS “does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports,” according to the report, so as always, a degree of caution is necessary when interpreting the results. “The US Growth theme is among the highest ranking in our REVS framework,” wrote lead author, and UBS U.S. strategist, Sean Simonds, and the rest his team. Other U.S. Growth leaders were Meta, Docusign, Monday.com, Uber and Cardinal Health. The quantimental stock selection framework gives companies a weighted score, with 30% based on the macro economic regime (or the larger economic context), 30% going to earnings, 15% going to valuations and 25% going to sentiment, according to Simonds in an email to Fortune. Sunnyvale, California-based Fortinet scored a 0.63 out of a perfect score of one. Endesa, the Madrid based utility, came in second with a score of 0.61. Founded by brothers Ken and Michael Xie in 2000, Fortinet was a slow grower for its first 20 years, climbing to $23.62 as of November 2020. That month, as Covid quarantine forced clients to stay home, the stock started a year of nearly non-stop growth, hitting $69 in December 2021. In August, Fortinet bought artificial intelligence cloud security firm Lacework for an undisclosed amount, and is currently valued at $61.4 billion. Other themes ranked highly by UBS were EU Listed Eurozone Exposure, GLP-1 Winner (tracking the industry around the Glucagon-like peptides in Ozempic), and EU Renewables. The worst performing themes included European Value stocks such as BP, Listed China Exposure, including L’Oreal, and U.S. Low Income Consumer, including Monster Beverage, Autozone, and Dollar General, all of which “are among the lowest scoring stocks in these themes,” according to the report. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Utility Stocks Come Down From AI-Driven Highs

Time Published: 2024-10-09T21:51:03Z

Shares of power generators Constellation Energy (CEG), NRG Energy (NRG), and Vistra (VST) posted some of the steepest losses in the S&P 500 on Wednesday. The declines came after all three stocks ended last week with record highs on enthusiasm about opportunities to benefit from growing energy demand for data centers to support artificial intelligence (AI). The retreat for the red-hot electric utility stocks came as several analysts expressed concerns about the sustainability of their valuations following massive AI-driven gains this year. Although many analysts remain bullish about the upside potential for companies like Constellation, NRG, and Vistra as they could help meet the large energy demand needed to power AI, BTIG analysts suggested utilities could be set for a correction of around 7% to 10%. According to BTIG's analysis, the sector's valuation appears "stretched" relative to its historical levels, and utilities tend to drop off following periods of outperformance versus the broader markets. SentimenTrader's Jason Goepfert echoed that utility stocks have a history of reversing their momentum after strong runs, and added any cracks in the "new narrative about AI" could hit confidence in returns. Constellation Energy was the weakest performer of any S&P 500 stock Wednesday, plunging 6.1%. NRG Energy shares dropped 5.3%, while Vistra stock slipped almost 3%. Despite the declines, all three stocks remained solidly in positive territory for 2024. Constellation shares have more than doubled in value since the start of the year, while NRG stock is up more than 70%. Vistra, meanwhile, remains the S&P 500's top-performing stock this year, having more than tripled in value over the period.

Title: Elon Musk's 'We, Robot' event is on the horizon. Here's what you need to know

Time Published: 2024-10-09T20:40:00Z
Full Content:
Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is primed to unveil his company’s efforts to produce a self-driving “robotaxi,” either delivering a massive win for investors that justifies sacrificing a widely anticipated car — or a major disappointment. Musk has been talking about developing a robotaxi network since at least April 2019, when he spoke about a fleet of autonomous Teslas that could drive customers around whenever their owners didn’t need them. The next major update came in 2020 when the CEO said a robotaxi would be unveiled in 2023 and enter production in 2024, which didn’t happen. But on Thursday, after another set of delays, Tesla seems prepared for what Musk has called a “product launch” of the robotaxi. Whether or not it’s a successful launch akin to the 2012 unveiling of the Model X or falls flat like the infamous 2021 debut of Tesla’s Optimus robot, which showed off a person dancing in a costume, is unknown to anyone without insider knowledge. The “We, Robot” event is scheduled to start at 10:00 p.m. ET/7:00 p.m. PT on Thursday at Warner Bros. Discovery’s (WBD) movie studio near Los Angeles. While the studio floors will be flooded with Wall Street analysts, Tesla influencers, and investors, it will also be livestreamed on X, Musk’s social media platform. Here’s what you need to know. The robotaxi, nicknamed the Cybercab, is expected to be Tesla’s first car that doesn’t require a driver. The Austin, Texas-based company’s electric vehicles offer some self-driving capabilities through its driver assistance software, but a driver is still required. Tesla’s software, Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Autopilot, has also been the source of controversy and many headaches for Tesla, ranging from long-fought legal battles to accusations of false advertising. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has reviewed 956 crashes where Autopilot was initially reported to be in use. The agency has launched more than three dozen investigations into accidents involving Tesla’s software. According to Bloomberg News, the Cybercab is expected to have two front seats and two doors that open upward like “butterfly wings.” That would line up with the concept art featured in Walter Isaacson’s recent biography of Musk. Musk has also teased that his team will “show off a few other things” on Thursday, which has been linked by some to the three “mystery vehicles” included in Tesla’s presentation at its annual shareholder meeting. Musk is also expected to discuss his firm’s plans to develop and integrate FSD into its Semi truck, which has received a limited release, Bloomberg reports. Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster said last week he expects to see three vehicles, including the “Cybervan” — a rumored autonomous passenger van — and the $25,000 Model 2, which has been reportedly scrapped. Munster expects to see a prototype of the robotaxi, along with previews of the other vehicles. Although Tesla isn’t exactly a stranger to artificial intelligence or autonomy, it’s still going to be behind some rivals. Companies, such as Google’s (GOOGL) Waymo, have been operating autonomous vehicles for years, gathering data all the while, often without the controversies that have plagued Tesla. “Waymo is already way ahead of them, offering thousands of autonomous rides per week in several major cities, and Amazon’s (AMZN) Zoox is on schedule to debut next year,” GraniteShares CEO Will Rhind told Quartz over email. “In the robotaxi space, they don’t have the first mover advantage and that could be costly if it takes them a year or more to officially launch their service.” Tesla will also have to appeal to regulators and the broader public, which remains largely skeptical and even fearful of autonomous vehicles. Thursday’s event will take place on a lot with private roads, which may partially be because Tesla has yet to apply for a deployment permit from Californian authorities, as GLJ Research analyst and Tesla critic Gordon Johnson points out. One positive for the company going into Thursday, as Tesla bull and Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a Wednesday note, is that it isn’t exactly a slouch when it comes to collecting data. Tesla has more than 1.5 billion miles of FSD — a level 2 automation system, meaning that it is only partially automated — logged in its data centers. “There is clearly a number of hurdles and questions the industry/investors want to hear about including: insurance, cost of the vehicle, timing, regulatory approval timeline, and overall operations among other issues,” Ives said of the event. In June, Musk pitched his vision for a robotaxi network as a “combination of Airbnb and Uber,” since owners can opt their cars into the service at their leisure. He also reiterated his pitch to Tesla owners that they can make money on the self-driving fleet while sleeping, as the company would call cars to pick up customers of its potential ride-hail service through an app. “I’m highly confident that it will far exceed the value” of the monthly payments customers may have to pay for their cars, Musk said at Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting. Tesla will take part of the revenue earned from the potential service — which analysts say is likely years away — while the rest will go to owners. A timeline for Tesla’s eventual network is unclear, and something investors will be hoping Musk elaborates on Thursday. JPMorgan (JPM) analysts in June said they don’t expect material revenue generation for years to come. Guggenheim Securities’ Ronald Jewsikow told Yahoo Finance on Monday that a “real credible path to robotaxi commercialization in the next 12 to 24 months is extremely unlikely.” Ark Investment Management has forecast a scenario where robotaxis account for 90% of Tesla’s value by 2029, pushing the stock to as much as $3,100 per share. If a network isn’t operational by that year, its price target would fall to about $350 per share. Ark CEO Cathie Wood earlier this week said she thinks analysts will have to positively revise their estimates for the robotaxi’s effect on Tesla’s profits, telling Yahoo Finance she expects 80% gross margins. “This is not if, it is when for Tesla. And for Tesla, it’s also how quickly will they roll out?” Woods said. “How quickly will they go national, or even global, with their aspirations?” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Astera Labs (ALAB) shares jumped Wednesday after the Nvidia (NVDA) supplier announced new products to support artificial intelligence (AI). The company introduced two new fabric switches that Nvidia Senior VP of GPU Engineering Brian Kelleher said will support the chipmaker's AI infrastructure "across a wide variety of AI and [high-performance computing] workloads." Astera, which went public in March, said in its initial public offering (IPO) filing that its customers include several key players in the AI space such as Nvidia, as well as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Jefferies analysts said the new products could help Astera diversify its offerings and expand the market for its products. The analysts held a "buy" rating for the stock, with a price target of $65, about 6% above Wednesday's closing price of $61.22. Astera Labs shares surged over 15% Wednesday, and have gained about 70% from their IPO price in March.

Title: MicroStrategy Is a Strategic Buy to Capitalize on Bitcoin’s Outperformance
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microstrategy-strategic-buy-capitalize-bitcoin-174706028.html
Time Published: 2024-10-09T17:47:06Z
Full Content:
MicroStrategy (MSTR) is a tech company that has spent the last few years accumulating Bitcoin (BTC-USD) on its balance sheet through a well-executed financing strategy. This approach supports my bullish stance on the company, particularly in a rising crypto market. MSTR has outperformed Bitcoin, highlighting the advantages of holding the company’s stock over directly investing in the cryptocurrency. By investing in MSTR, investors can amplify Bitcoin’s potential returns through a regulated stock, making it a more accessible option for institutional investors compared to holding cryptocurrency directly. Specifically, this year, MSTR shares have benefited from their high correlation with Bitcoin’s price swings, rallying over 211%. Recently, the shares saw an increase in momentum following the Fed’s interest rate cut. The last time this occurred, Bitcoin’s price more than doubled. In this article, I will delve into the strategy behind MicroStrategy’s business and explain why buying at current levels may be a wise decision. Before delving further into the bullish thesis, it’s essential to provide some context. MicroStrategy is (or was) primarily a data software company that helps customers make informed decisions by analyzing large sets of data from multiple sources. However, facing strong competition from powerful players like Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM), its core business has struggled to grow. About four years ago, the company pivoted to make aggressive investments in Bitcoin, led by its CEO, Michael Saylor, a staunch advocate of cryptocurrency. According to MicroStrategy’s shareholder letter released last year, the company holds an unwavering confidence in Bitcoin for the long term. The management team stated, “Because of its characteristics, we believe Bitcoin is a superior store of value, akin to digital gold or digital property. Just as records and CDs gave way to digital music, we believe gold and other traditional physical stores of value will give way to Bitcoin.” Currently, about 38% of MicroStrategy’s market cap corresponds to its Bitcoin holdings. By the end of July, MicroStrategy owned 226,500 Bitcoins, purchased at a total cost of $8.3 billion, and now valued at about $14.3 billion. The main bullish argument for MicroStrategy centers on its clever strategy of expanding its balance sheet through Bitcoin acquisitions. Since 2020, CEO Michael Saylor has focused on growing MicroStrategy’s value by buying Bitcoin with debt, particularly through convertible bonds, and capitalizing on the cryptocurrency’s high volatility. As the price of Bitcoin rises, the company is able to borrow even more money and add to its crypto holdings. At the same time, the company generates revenue from its software business, which amounted to $111 million in Q2, the most recent quarter. However, this represents a slowdown compared to the $120 million generated during the same period last year. As a result, over the past five years, MicroStrategy’s shares have appreciated by nearly 1,200%, closely mirroring fluctuations in Bitcoin prices. However, the journey has not always been smooth. A few years ago, high inflation and rising interest rates made it more expensive for the company to issue new debt or rollover existing obligations. During the crypto winter, from early 2021 to early 2023, MSTR shares plummeted by as much as 86%, falling to less than $15 per share. Today, however, shares have rebounded and exceed $185. My Buy stance on MicroStrategy extends to the belief that purchasing MicroStrategy stock may be more advantageous than buying the cryptocurrency or investing in a BTC fund. At first glance, it may seem illogical to pay a premium on MicroStrategy’s net asset value (NAV) in Bitcoin, which currently exceeds 2.3x. This premium reflects how much more or less the market values the company’s stock compared to its Bitcoin holdings alone, especially when you could simply buy the cryptocurrency directly. However, MicroStrategy’s primary advantage lies in its ability to capitalize on and acquire more Bitcoin. So far this year, the company issued two convertible debt offerings at less than 1% in March, scaled up its convertible note offering in June, and conducted another offering more recently in September, using the proceeds to buy additional Bitcoin. This ability to raise capital is one of the main justifications cited by Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer, who notes that the company has timed the market extraordinarily well. In fact, MicroStrategy’s stock has significantly outperformed Bitcoin since it began its Bitcoin acquisition strategy in August 2020. It has also outperformed the S&P 500 (SPY), NASDAQ (QQQ), gold (GLD), silver (SLV), and major tech stocks. Palmer concludes that, particularly in a bull market, the premium on MicroStrategy shares is justified, and I tend to agree. The Wall Street consensus on MSTR stock is exceptionally optimistic. All eight analysts covering the stock recommend buying it, resulting in a Strong Buy consensus. The average price target is $202.25, indicating a potential upside of 2.93% based on the latest share price. In summary, I believe that during crypto bull markets, investors who are bullish on Bitcoin should consider a position in MicroStrategy. This approach makes sense because MicroStrategy’s use of debt to increase its Bitcoin holdings has been effectively executed, potentially leading to outperformance relative to both the market and the currency itself. Therefore, I view MicroStrategy as a Buy. However, investors should be aware of the risks associated with strong volatility, as fluctuating Bitcoin prices can quickly alter the short- to medium-term outlook.

Title: Dell staffers scramble to find childcare after 5-days-a-week office mandate gives just a few days’ notice: report
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/10/09/business/dell-staffers-forced-to-return-to-office-on-short-notice-report/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T17:16:39Z
Full Content:
Dell sent staffers into a panic last week by mandating they return to the office five days a week – on just a few days’ notice, according to a report. The Round Rock, Texas-based tech company sent its sales team a memo on Sept. 26, a Thursday, mandating employees return to full-time, in-person work starting that Monday, according to a Business Insider report. “The expectation is that ALL Global Sales team members who can work from a Dell office be on-site five days a week, regardless of role,” the internal memo from sales chiefs Bill Scannell and John Byrne said, according to BI. Parents ran into roadblocks as they scrambled to find last-minute childcare on Thursday night and discovered that after-school programs were already fully booked. “The biggest thing that I saw from just being in the office that day was parents freaking out,” a Dell sales employee told BI. “It’s one thing to already have childcare set up and already having to pay that crazy amount, but having a weekend to figure it out …” Scannell and Byrne acknowledged in the memo that workers “may need some time to make new arrangements,” but they did not provide details or specific accommodations that could be made, the report said. “We continually evolve our business so we’re set up to deliver the best innovation, value and service to our customers and partners,” a Dell spokesperson told The Post. “That includes more in-person connection to drive market leadership.” Dell is the latest major company to force its employees to resume in-office work – echoing mandates this year from companies like Amazon, Salesforce and PricewaterhouseCoopers. But Dell’s mandate comes as a particular shock to its salespeople, who were told in February they could choose between hybrid or remote work. The hybrid policy took effect in May. Hybrid staffers needed to be in the office about three days a week. Though the software giant tracked employee attendance, the hybrid policy was fairly flexible. Many employees left the office at lunchtime and worked from home the rest of the day, Dell workers told BI. One Dell salesperson told BI they started searching for childcare options on Thursday night, but found programs were already filled for the year. “They have to have all these finalized before the year starts, and the next enrollment isn’t until December or even when summer starts,” the employee said. “I’m on a waiting list, and I don’t have an option to put these kids in full time.” Two other Dell employees said they were facing the same problem while trying to find childcare. Another Dell employee said they used to leave the office at lunchtime to help their partner manage school pick-up times. They said their managers had been flexible and their productivity had not fallen since switching to hybrid work. The worker discussed their concerns about the in-office mandate with managers and Dell’s Human Resources department, who told the worker to use PTO when they could not work during work hours. “It wasn’t clarified if I can log back in at home after or if I’m expected to come back,” the employee said. Dell staffers told BI the office and its parking lots were packed one week into the policy. Employees said they were worried about running through their PTO while trying to balance the new mandate. “If we run out of that PTO, then we’re facing disciplinary actions,” one worker said. “It’s very disheartening. It makes me really not trust the company.” Multiple employees said they had heard from managers that the policy would be rolled out to other departments, but they were unsure when. One Dell worker said a senior leader told them last week that the return-to-office mandate might be required “because that’s what Amazon is doing.” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy issued a full-time, return-to-office mandate a week before Dell’s policy. But Amazon staffers have until January to make the change. The in-person mandate is an effort on Amazon’s part to foster collaboration seen pre-pandemic, making it easier for teammates to “learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture,” Jassy said in a note. Some 91% of Amazon workers are dissatisfied with the mandate and a whopping 73% said they are considering looking for another job, according to a survey of 2,585 Amazon employees conducted by professional social network Blind. Amazon may be viewing the uproar as a success, as some have speculated the mandate is an effort to reduce headcount without issuing widespread layoffs. Advertisement

Title: Nvidia wants to drive AI costs down as 'reasoning' models rise
URL: https://qz.com/jensen-huang-nvidia-ai-innovation-faster-chips-podcast-1851668840
Time Published: 2024-10-09T17:15:43Z

Nvidia’s (NVDA) chips have been a driver of the current artificial intelligence boom — and the chipmaker only wants to make it move faster, chief executive Jensen Huang said. During an appearance on the Tech Unheard podcast, Huang was asked by host Rene Haas, chief executive of British semiconductor company Arm (ARM), if the pace of AI innovation is moving “faster than you imagined.” Huang replied, “No,” and said Nvidia is “trying to make it go faster.” “We’ve gone to a one-year cycle,” Huang said about the company’s production of new chips. “And the reason for that is because the technology has the opportunity to move fast.” Nvidia is designing “six or seven new chips per system,” Huang said, then using “co-design to reinvent the entire system” and inventing other technologies that allow it to improve performance by two or three times while using the same amount of energy and cost each year. “That’s another way of, essentially, reducing the cost of AI by two or three times per year,” Huang said. “That is way faster than Moore’s Law.” Over the next few years, Huang said, Nvidia wants to drive down the cost of AI amid the rise of even more complex models. This evolution is already underway. In September, OpenAI released a new series of “reasoning” AI models called o1, which are “designed to spend more time thinking before they respond,” the way humans do. In the future, AI services such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which Huang said he uses every day, will “iteratively reason about the answer” and could go through hundreds or thousands of inferences before producing an output. This level of complex processing would require significantly more computational power than current models. Despite the increased demands, Huang believes the trade-off is worthwhile. “[T]he quality of the answer is so much better,” Huang said. “We want to drive the cost down so that we could deliver this new type of reasoning inference with the same level of cost and responsiveness as the past.” On Wednesday, Nvidia’s stock was climbing back toward its record high $135 close in June. The chipmaker’s shares were down 0.27% during midday trading, but opened up almost 1% at around $134 per share.

Title: Reddit Stock Rises as Jefferies Calls Stock a 'Buy' on AI Strengths
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/reddit-stock-rises-as-jefferies-calls-stock-a-buy-on-ai-strengths-8725540
Time Published: 2024-10-09T16:57:54Z

Reddit (RDDT) shares climbed Wednesday after analysts at Jefferies initiated coverage of the social media platform with a "buy" rating, citing its success within Google search results and its artificial intelligence (AI) use cases. The firm issued a price target of $90 per share, a 27% premium over Tuesday's closing price and well above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Reddit's user growth accelerated to 51% in the second quarter, the firm noted, its highest level in four years. A big reason for that is the success of a revamped web platform the company debuted last year, which has led to "deeper integration into Google search." The company's average revenue per user is actually well below rivals Pinterest (PINS) and Snapchat (SNAP), which suggests a "long runway for increased monetization," analysts said. Reddit’s large library of user posts are a valuable resource for companies developing generative AI models, Jefferies said. The company has established about $325 million in contract licensing revenue over the next three years, led by deals with Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and OpenAI. Going forward, the firm suggested that partnerships with companies such as Amazon (AMZN) and Anthropic could be in the cards, which would mean more high-margin revenue streams. Shares of Reddit climbed about 2% intraday Wednesday and are up about 43% since the company's IPO in March.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock is aiming for a new all-time high close as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom. The stock traded flat midday Wednesday at $133. It previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. Nvidia stock notched its fifth consecutive day of gains Tuesday, rising 4% to $132.89. Shares are up 12% from last week. The stock’s climb has been fueled by a barrage of good news for the company. Wall Street analysts this week have reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs “remains extremely robust.” A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia’s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday. Nvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan’s largest supercomputer during Foxconn’s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a megafactory it’s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia’s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions. Nvidia’s weeklong ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company’s second-quarter earnings. Shares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China, due to rising trade tensions with the US, had also driven shares down. Nvidia’s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June. Other positive news in the semiconductor sector Wednesday could help Nvidia stock achieve a new record close. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations — another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term. “AI is hot,” Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, “I see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.” The chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech’s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished, despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown. Semiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia’s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that it’s boosting capacity to meet “crazy” demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs (graphics processing units). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips has been “insane.” Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Here's how I would make a dream PS5 Pro setup this Prime Day

Time Published: 2024-10-09T16:08:45Z
Full Content:
Make your PS5 setup "pro", with or without the upgraded console When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. As someone who reviews all sorts of PS5 accessories for a living, I would argue you can make a PS5 Pro setup without buying Sony's new $699 console. Sure, a new GPU that can use AI upscaling and generally fling better graphics at your display is nice, but I'd argue that quality-of-life updates through upgrading other parts of your gaming setup will make much more of a difference to you. Of course, with Prime Day PS5 deals going on at the same time as PS5 pre-orders, now is a great time to shop for either a new console or some new gaming hardware and accessories. Since I've been keeping tabs on both of these things, I thought it would be a great opportunity to sift through the digital storefronts, finding the very best PS5 accessories and upgrades. Now, I totally appreciate that if you bought all of the products in the list below, you'd probably run your bank account through the wringer, and at that point, you may even spend more than you would on a PS5 Pro. I've put together the list below because barring the TV I've picked out, I've had hands-on time with every single thing, and can attest to each one making a massive difference to my gaming time. Without further ado, here are the Prime Day deals I'd use to make a dream PS5 Pro setup. SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P | $179.99 $109 at Amazon Save $70 - I use this headset every time I boot up the PS5, and you can get it here at its lowest-ever price. It as previously down to $125 in September, but this extra discount makes it particularly tempting. Buy it if: ✅ You want exceptional sound quality ✅ You want a simultaneous Bluetooth connection ✅ You don't use the USB-C port on your console for anything else. Don't buy it if: ❌ You want a wireless mixer Price check: Best Buy: $179.99 UK: £137.74 at Amazon If you sift through enough of my ramblings about gaming tech, you'll know that audio means a great deal to me when gaming. I'm a huge lover of video game soundtracks, and I also play a lot of Hunt: Showdown, a game where audio is paramount to success. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P is a great headset above all, conveying sound cues accurately and balancing the varying tones of soundtracks beautifully. The other reason I love this headset though, and would recommend it at this price, is because it has simultaneous Bluetooth connectivity. That means that while your headset is connected to the PS5 or a PC through the wireless USB-C dongle, you can also connect your phone to it through Bluetooth. When you're scrolling through your phone while a game loads or you're taking a break, the audio will come through your headset at the same time. It's a huge quality-of-life feature I now don't want to go without. Corsair MP600 Elite 1TB | $99.99 $84.99 at Amazon Save $15 - If a storage upgrade would be more beneficial, this 1TB drive is the deal I'd make the most of this Prime Day. For being one of the best drives on the market, this really is a great price to pay. Buy it if: ✅ You want a top-performing SSD ✅ You need more storage space ✅ You'd like something that's simple to install Don't buy it if: ❌ You've pre-ordered the PS5 Pro Price check: Walmart: $84.99 UK: £97.99 at Amazon The PS5 Pro comes with a 2TB internal drive, which is nice, but it seems a bit pointless to me. The best SSDs for PS5 already exist, and you can usually find another 1TB drive to slot into an existing console without spending $100. The Corsair MP600 Elite is one of the first drives I'd recommend to PS5 owners this year. It outperforms the majority of other compatible options for this console, and it has one of the best integrated heatsinks I've come across. As true as that is, you can still get it for the price of the budget brands, thanks to this deal. If you just want an extra terabyte of space so you don't need to keep deleting games, this is the one I'd point you toward. If you want some serious future-proofing, on the other hand, check out the drive below. Samsung 990 Pro 4TB | $479.99 $265.99 at Amazon Save over $200 - Over $200 is a lot of money to spend on a small accessory for PS5. However, 4TB of space will last you for years to come, even if you download pretty much everything that gets added to PlayStation Plus every month. I've never seen this drive so cheap, so it's an amazing time to buy. Buy it if: ✅ You want to upgrade your storage ✅ You genuinely need 4TB ✅ You want the best SSD going Don't buy it if: ❌ You don't care about read/write speeds UK: £284.18 at Amazon The 4TB Samsung 990 Pro is the drive I use in my own console, and yes, it is arguably overkill. Still, its probably the best performing SSD out there at the moment. It's certainly the best one you can get for the PS5 because of its relentless speed. The majority of people don't actually need 4TB, but if you're building the setup of dreams, that will usually involve never needing to upgrade again. PSVR 2 | $549 $494.99 at Walmart Save $100 - I wasn't sure we'd see PSVR 2 get more price cuts this year after a big Days of Play discount brought it down by $100 during the summer. This is a really nice way to get it a bit cheaper if you missed that price though. Buy it if: ✅ You like VR gaming ✅ You have a gaming PC or PS5 ✅ You have the space to use it Don't buy it if: ❌ VR gaming makes you feel unwell Price check: Amazon: $529 | Best Buy: $549.99 UK: £495 at Amazon PSVR 2 is one of my favorite bits of gaming hardware. I know it isn't exactly a cheap upgrade for an existing PS5 owner, but it is probably one of the best ways to enjoy your console. VR gaming isn't for everyone, but this is arguably one of the best things about the PS5 because it adds a whole other layer of enjoyment to a platform that's struggled to put out first-party titles consistently. If you're at all interested in making the perfect PS5 setup, the best VR headset on the market right now has to be on your radar. GameSir G8 Galileo | $79.99 $61.59 at Amazon Save $18 - This mobile controller is more comfortable and more useful than a Backbone one. It also costs less money - especially in this deal. I'd recommend it any day of the week, but with an $18 reduction, it's even more tempting. Buy it if: ✅ You want to play PS5 Remote Play ✅ You have larger hands ✅ You want back buttons Don't buy it if: ❌ You don't have a USB-C phone UK: £59.99 at Amazon The GameSir G8 Galileo is the best mobile controller right now, and it'll save you a lot more money than if you were to buy the PlayStation Portal. I'm not sure it should be able to, but the G8 can be used for PS5 Remote Play, which is incredible for a non-officially licensed controller. If you ever take your gaming sessions on the go, the GameSir G8 Galileo is the best PS controller you had no idea existed. Victrix Pro BFG wireless controller in white | $179.99 $154.99 at Amazon Save $35 - A 20% discount is exclusive to the white colorway of this controller, but it's a total steal if you're looking for an amazingly versatile PS5 controller.

AI behemoth NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is breaking out and could be heading to its June high of around $141 per share, according to technical analyst Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies. "Heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) confirmed a triangle breakout yesterday, supporting near-term follow-through toward its June high (~$141)," Stockton said. "While the SPX and NDX have seen short-term momentum weaken, NVDA’s breakout is likely to prevent a major pullback in the major indices, which is part of the reason why we keep a short-term neutral bias for U.S. equities in today's Fairlead Tactics." NVIDIA stock has been up six straight sessions, including today's fractional gain of 0.12%. The stock is up more than 170% year-to-date. Analysts have been increasingly bullish on the company's Blackwell product, which the CEO Jensen Huang said is seeing "insane" demand. "Blackwell is in full production, Blackwell is as planned, and demand for Blackwell is insane," Huang said on CNBC's last week. "Everyone wants the most, and everyone wants to be first." Today, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) reported that September sales beat estimates on solid AI chip demand. TSM said revenue for September 2024 was approximately NT$251.87 billion, an increase of 0.4 percent from August 2024 and an increase of 39.6 percent from September 2023. TSM makes NVIDIA's AI chip. On Tuesday, analysts at Morgan Stanley said Blackwell production revenue in 1Q25 may surpass Hopper. Blackwell chips command a price premium, with B200 chips priced 60-70% higher than H200, positioning Blackwell revenue to overtake Hopper in the upcoming quarter.

Title: 2 Big Dividends To Buy As Inflation Returns

Inflation Graphic to illustrate strong rising inflation. 3D illustration Another day, another sign the economy is heading straight for that “no-landing” scenario I’ve been talking about for weeks now … … and yet another sign the two dividends we’re going to discuss today are better buys than they’ve been in months. (One of these staunch payers kicks out a rich 8% divvie. The other has grown its dividend a ridiculous 425% in the last five years. A buy back then would be kicking out a sweet 6.2% dividend today, thanks to that breakneck growth!) When you hear “no landing,” your first impression might be that it sounds like a good thing, right? After all, it implies the economy will keep humming along, and that recession we’ve been worrying about since, well, 2020, will keep being pushed back. All good. Except here’s the rub: Inflation comes back. I mean, when you have a federal government spending nearly $2 trillion more than it’s taking in, it’s easy to see how this monetary inflation could seep into consumer price inflation. And there’s no way an extra $2 trillion dropping into the system isn’t going to juice the economy! No matter who wins the election, I think we can all agree that this spending is unlikely to be tamed. The opposite, in fact—fueling inflation even more. A quick look at the headlines brings more warnings of a potential resurgence of inflation: An expanding war in the Middle East, for example, has been pushing up oil prices. And even though the port workers’ strike has been settled, it reminds us how easily our supply chains can be disrupted. And of course we had last week’s blowout jobs report, which showed continued strong wage growth. Jay Powell seems to see this inflationary wave rolling in. Last week, he tamped down expectations of more jumbo rate cuts, like the 50-pointer the Fed dropped last month. Futures markets agree—they now point to just 75 basis points in cuts between now and the Fed’s last meeting of the year, on December 18. So where does that leave us? We’re looking to buy dividends that ride this growing economy while profiting from inflation’s return. That setup points straight to one sector: natural gas stocks. There are two other reasons to buy “natty” stocks now, too. First, there’s the massive stimulus plan China announced a little over a week ago. That’s likely to spur gas demand, as China is the biggest importer, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The other factor working in our favor is gas’s tendency to hit its $2 “price floor” and bounce—exactly what it’s doing now. A price that’s bottomed and has momentum? That’s typically a great time to buy. So let’s dive into those two dividends I mentioned off the top, starting with our 8% payer. At times like these, with energy prices still low but moving up, we look to the 8% dividend kicked out by the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP Alerian MLP ETF ), which holds the shares of energy infrastructure companies. These firms—master limited partnerships (MLPs), to be exact—collect tolls on the oil and gas that moves through their lines and sits in their storage tanks. MLPs make money in all energy seasons, but it’s much better to own them when prices are at least steady or better yet rising, to snag price upside and sweet dividend payouts. When oil and gas prices (and shipping volumes) rise, the pipeline stocks AMLP owns boost their dividends. That’s resulted in a steady grind higher for the fund’s payout: AMLP Dividend Best of all, AMLP’s rising payout pulls its price up—a phenomenon I call the “Dividend Magnet.” The pattern is unmistakable: AMLP Dividend Magnet So where does that leave us? With an 8% “starter” yield that’s set to grow on a buy made today, as our “no-landing” setup pushes commodity demand (and prices) higher. Oh, and a share price poised to ride right along with it, too. By the way, buying MLPs through AMLP also eliminates one of the headaches of buying MLPs “direct”: complicated tax reporting. AMLP’s top holding, Plains All-American Pipeline LP (PAA), kicks you a fussy K-1 form at tax time, which is a hassle for you or the pro who files your taxes. (Trust me, I once got a firm talking-to from my accountant after buying MLPs a few years ago.) But buy through AMLP and voila, no K-1! Just a normal 1099 showing your dividends received. Which, of course, dishes that elite 8%. When natural gas is in the early stages of a rally, EQT Corp. (EQT) is my “go to” stock. The company boasts nearly 4,000 drilling locations—and the lowest breakeven costs in the industry. (Names hidden in the chart below to protect the less profitable!) FCF Breakeven The prices above indicate at what level the company’s gas is profitable to drill. Notice that EQT leads the pack overall. What’s more, the company is tightening its grip on the prolific Appalachian Basin through its recently completed $14-billion acquisition of Equitrans Midstream, its former midstream business, which adds 3,700 miles of pipeline, plus storage assets. EQT sees the move resulting in $425 million in cost savings (The firm also recently cut its workforce by 15%). It also nicely positions EQT as it moves to boost production after last winter no-showed in large parts of the country, hitting gas prices. Remember, too, that natural gas is the least offensive of the fossil fuels, which gives it long-term upside as a “transition” fuel as the world shifts toward renewables. NatGas Demand Growth Which brings us back to the Dividend Magnet. For months and even a few years, tickers can meander independently of their dividends. But eventually, they do follow their payouts higher like a puppy dog. EQT’s dividend has leaped above its stock, putting a strong pull on its price: EQT Dividend Magnet Even if I’m wrong with my “no-landing” call, all signs point to this one winning anyway. The stock is still well off its 2022 peak, its dividend is on a tear, and natgas production is about to ramp up, thanks in part to surging power demand from energy transition. That makes now a great time to buy EQT—and its charged-up Dividend Magnet. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are nearing their all-time highs Wednesday morning on positive news about the chipmaker's artificial intelligence (AI) products. Nvidia shares, which have ended higher the past five sessions, recently edged up to $133.30. Their all-time closing high is $135.58, achieved on June 18, and record intraday high is $140.76, recorded the following session two days later, after markets were closed for Juneteenth. On Tuesday, contract electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn reported strong demand for its servers powered by Nvidia's GB200 semiconductors, part of the latter's Blackwell architecture. Microsoft announced it was "the 1st cloud" running the Blackwell system with GB200-powered AI servers. OpenAI also thanked Nvidia for delivering "one of the first engineering builds of the DGX B200 to our office." Also yesterday, Nvidia noted that the Blackwell platform has slashed energy consumption by up to 2,000 times over the last decade for AI training models such as OpenAI's GPT-4. Bob Pette, vice president and general manager of Nvidia's enterprise platforms, told participants at the company's AI Summit that "We are in the dawn of a new industrial revolution," adding that the firm is "designing our systems with not just performance in mind, but with energy efficiency in mind." Nvidia shares have soared about 170% this year. TradingView

September sales rose at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), with the chipmaker on Wednesday reporting numbers that pointed toward better-than-expected third-quarter revenue. The company, which supplies tech heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reported September sales of 251.87 billion New Taiwan dollars ($7.82 billion), up just under 40% from the same time last year. Added to its results for August and July, TSMC reported NT$759.69 billion ($23.58 billion) in revenue for the third quarter, above the NT$749.88 billion analysts tracked by Visible Alpha had expected and roughly 36% above sales for the third quarter of 2023. The results surpassed TSMC's own outlook, as the company said in its second-quarter earnings report that it expected third-quarter revenue between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. The company's US-traded shares were recently down more than 1% as broader markets wavered. The stock has risen steadily from August lows and is near record levels, up roughly 75% this year. The PHLX index of semiconductor shares edged lower Thursday. TSMC is set to report the rest of its third-quarter financial results on the morning of Oct. 17. The company surpassed estimates in the first two quarters of 2024, as demand for its chips to power AI technology have remained in high demand.

Nvidia stock seems to be climbing back to its record high close from June. The AI chipmaker’s stock was up almost 1% at the open on Wednesday, to about $134 per share. It later fell to about $133 per share. Nvidia (NVDA) shares closed at almost $133 the day before. Nvidia’s rising stock has pushed its market capitalization past Microsoft’s (MSFT) again. During Wednesday morning trading, the chipmaker’s market cap reached $3.26 trillion, while Microsoft’s was $3.09 trillion. Both trailed Apple’s (AAPL) market cap of $3.44 trillion. In June, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple in total market cap and crossed the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. Just weeks later, it overtook both Apple and Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable public company. Despite falling back down, Nvidia remains the most valuable semiconductor company in the world. In February, it became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after reporting record fourth-quarter earnings. In June, Nvidia’s shares closed at a record high $135.58, days after it initiated a 10-for-1 stock split. Since then, its shares have experienced some turbulence, but the company’s stock is still up 173.4% so far this year. Compared to a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up 192%. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), which supplies Nvidia and Apple with chips, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue of NT$759.7 billion, or $23.6 billion, for the September quarter, according to Reuters.

Title: Pinterest shares target raised on positive outlook

On Wednesday, KeyBanc raised the stock price target for Pinterest Inc (NYSE: NYSE:PINS) to $45 from the previous $43, while maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock. The adjustment follows the firm's assessment that Pinterest presents significant growth potential ahead of its upcoming earnings report. The company's favorable position is attributed to multiple factors. Foreign exchange rates are seen as increasingly beneficial, user engagement remains strong, and new product developments are on the horizon. One such development, Performance+, is expected to simplify campaign management on the platform. Drawing parallels to similar offerings from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META), the analyst anticipates that Performance+ could spur sustained growth for Pinterest over the coming years. Despite challenges in the food and beverage sector, Pinterest is expected to overcome these as it moves past the comparative period in the fourth quarter. This year also marks the first holiday season where Pinterest will benefit from monetization efforts with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google. These initiatives, combined with a disciplined approach to expenses, are projected to result in at least 300 basis points of annual margin expansion. The firm's outlook is further bolstered by the current market valuation of Pinterest shares. With the stock trading at multiples of 15.6x and 12.2x the estimated enterprise value to EBITDA for 2025 and 2026, respectively, the analyst suggests that the market may be underestimating Pinterest's growth trajectory. In other recent news, Pinterest has been the subject of several analyst reviews. Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on Pinterest, emphasizing the company's potential for high-teen growth rates and margin expansion. BofA Securities also reiterated a Buy rating on Pinterest shares, highlighting the company's ongoing integration of AI technology and its potential to achieve double-digit core growth by 2025. Deutsche Bank upgraded Pinterest's stock rating from Hold to Buy, citing the potential of its affluent user base and projected a 6% compound annual growth rate for Pinterest's global monthly active users with an 18% revenue growth over the next three years. Oppenheimer initiated coverage of Pinterest with an Outperform rating, emphasizing the platform's unique position in the digital advertising space. The firm also noted Pinterest as the fastest-growing digital advertising platform. Baird reiterated an Outperform rating, focusing on the platform's potential for sustained growth in user base, engagement, and monetization. These are recent developments for Pinterest, a company that has also been working on expanding its operations. The third quarter of 2024 is expected to be the first complete quarter to reflect the revenue impact of the company's expansion efforts, which included the monetization of approximately 30 new countries through Google's platform. Pinterest's referral traffic from Amazon showed a notable increase in September, surging 148% year-over-year. The company's recent global advertising event, Pinterest Presents, showcased the platform's advancements and potential for sustained growth in user base, engagement, and monetization. Recent data from InvestingPro provides additional context to KeyBanc's optimistic outlook on Pinterest. As of the last twelve months ending Q2 2024, Pinterest's revenue grew by 16.22%, reaching $3.34 billion. This growth aligns with KeyBanc's expectations of significant potential for the company. InvestingPro Tips highlight that Pinterest's net income is expected to grow this year, supporting the analyst's projection of margin expansion. The company's strong financial position is further evidenced by the fact that it holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, potentially providing flexibility for future investments in product development and growth initiatives. It is worth noting that while Pinterest is trading at a high P/E ratio of 115.63, it's also trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, with a PEG ratio of 0.71. This suggests that the market may indeed be undervaluing Pinterest's growth prospects, as KeyBanc pointed out. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Pinterest, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Web dev at the end of the world, from Hveragerði, Iceland Because this essay is over 11 000 words long(!) I’ve made a convenience EPUB file for offline reading. (EPUB only! No PDF this time.) You can download it over on the fulfilment service I use, Lemon Squeezy, with the option to pay what you want if you feel the urge to support my writing. Paying is absolutely optional. Unless you’re like me – an “extremely online” kind of web developer – you probably don’t notice the dramas and brouhahas that erupt in the web developer community with regularity. Most of the time these flame-wars offer little of value or less in terms of technical insight and the patter of angry voices fades away before it reaches the ears of the less online. But a recent one, which began when the maintainer of the SolidJS web development framework wrote a long and very angry-sounding blog post outlining why he didn’t think web components represented the future of web development, is a little bit less usual. Not because it has staying power. It’s fading away at the same steady pace as these things usually do. It’s interesting because it touches on what I think is a genuinely interesting technical issue, but in a way that pretty much forces every reader to ignore it. Normally, these “debates” are free of useful information. Often it’s somebody railing against this or that for largely personal reasons – I’ve certainly been guilty of that. Other times the points being made on both sides are largely innocuous. The people involved just seem to be using their “outside voices”, metaphorically speaking, for no particular reason. “You should write tests!” “Yes, but you need to do it properly! Otherwise, they just get in the way!” “I AGREE BUT I PHRASE IT IN A WAY THAT MAKES ME SOUND ANGRY AT YOU BECAUSE THIS IS THE INTERNET AND I’M PROBABLY ANGRY AT SOMETHING!” It’s tiresome, especially because it’s common for this mode of debating to split people who are largely in agreement into groups that chalk each other up as assholes. The worst part being that both sides are generally true. Everybody involved had an asshole moment or two. What makes the web components debate interesting is that, this being the internet, many of the participants are behaving like assholes (though not you, dear reader, you’re one of the wonderful sensible few of the internet) while at the same time making interesting yet conflicting technical points. “These two groups seem to both be making solid technical points, and yet they end up disagreeing,” is always interesting. It means the topic has curious nuances and, possibly, unresolved hard questions. That bit is genuinely fun, at least if you’re of a personality type that finds unresolved hard questions fun. The tone and attitudes of some of the posts involved make it difficult, but discovering if there’s a “there” there can be worthwhile. But, because of the “everybody defaults to ‘asshole’” nature of social media, we often end up in a discourse archipelago where each island vehemently sticks to its opinions, never listening to the other, because most humans will resolutely ignore advice and observations if they come from somebody they consider to be an asshole. The core point of the current hubbub, if you dig through the rhetoric and follow the links back to earlier discussions and arguments is: It’s really hard to add extensibility and “composability” to an already complex class inheritance tree with pre-existing and rigidly defined composition system without making some hard compromises. But to get to that point, the point where we can dig into the technical details of the whys and wherefores, we first need to understand the context. We need to be able to look past the assholes to see the forest. We need to understand what somebody means when they say “web components”. If you aren’t directly involved in specific kinds of web development, you might not have a clear idea of what Web Components are. They are a set of web APIs that have been standardised and, for the most part, implemented by web browsers. They are a standard method for implementing and distributing reusable widgets. That’s pretty much it. There are a few features and details that surround these, help them integrate with other APIs, help smooth the edges, but this is Web Components. Together, these APIs let us build custom widgets that can be safely packaged into a custom element and will interoperate with pretty much anything that renders to a DOM, even React (though React specifically blocked custom elements for what honestly sounded like spurious reasons for the longest time and even now full support has only shipped in a beta release). Web Components aren’t what you would call a “disruptive” innovation, but they are genuinely useful. More so now they more reliably work with forms in modern browsers. They are a “hey, you know that thing browsers do? Well now you can do a little bit of that yourself” kind of extension mechanism. Slightly complicating the issue, the term tends to get reused across a few contexts. This last type of project is the one that’s of most interest to those in software development who might have to do some incidental web development. Because of how late Safari was to supporting form-associated custom elements, we’re only in the early stages of what Web Component Libraries can offer, but they have the potential to provide ready-made yet powerful and customisable widgets people could use when making websites, services, or web apps, no matter what client-side or server-side framework they’re using. Described this way, you might wonder how an otherwise innocuous set of web APIs, designed to aid in the making of reusable widgets, so consistently cause tension and conflict among web developers. So much so that it’s almost certainly a very bad idea for me to wade into it with this essay. Why do Web Components cause online web developer communities to erupt in anger and argument? To answer that, we need to go back over a decade, at least thirteen years, all the way back to 2011. The impression you’re likely to get from discussions online would be that web components were created as a reaction to the rampant growth of React-based frameworks bloating websites and breaking accessibility. You couldn’t be faulted for thinking that web component APIs came about as a proposed fix. “Stop using React and use these APIs, they come with the web!” But web components not only predate the popular misuse of React and the rise of frameworks, they arguably predate React itself. Web components surfaced to public view in 2011 in a talk at the Fronteers conference by Alex Russell. These weren’t the web components you see today as the code he was presenting was a library, not a proposed standard – that would come later – but the shape of it is extremely familiar to those who have used modern Web Components. React at this point was still an internal project at Facebook and had only been in use for a few months, if that. These were two very different approaches towards creating dynamic web-based user interfaces, and they were as good as invented simultaneously. Their launch as public projects also happened at pretty much the same time with Google’s first attempt to standardise Web Components and Facebook’s first launch of React as an open source project both happening in 2013. This was, in my personal opinion, the point where multiple schisms in web development began to happen, the break that has hindered web developer discourse since. I should emphasise here that the following description of events is my opinion only and entirely based on what I saw as an outside observer. I was not privy to any private discussions or chats. I absolutely missed out on some important context, but I can say that this is what it looked like to a lot of people at the time. I appreciate that everybody involved meant well and had good reasons for their behaviour, but people will form their opinion of you based on what they know and see, which doesn’t include the stuff they don’t know about, and especially doesn’t include the stuff you haven’t made public. People do not read between the lines on the internet. At best, they make weird shit up and pretend it’s true. Web Components at this point were, and I know quite a few people will again disagree with me, an entirely proprietary Google project, much like React was an entirely proprietary Facebook project. Web components during these first three years, the first iteration that later got called “Web Components v0”, were only ever implemented by Google, only promoted by Google, and its biggest users were Google products and frameworks. The “polyfills”, itself a term that implies inevitable standardisation, were from the perspective of everybody not using Google’s Chrome the actual implementation of Web Components. They were slow as hell. This made the overall experience of Google properties that used them, such as YouTube, noticeably worse in Firefox. Not a great look, folks! To make matters worse – and, again, this is based on my impressions at the time and I know plenty of people disagree with me – a few of the more “enthusiastic” Web Components promoters during these three years were parading around being absolute assholes, to an even greater degree than seemed normal in online developer circles. Many of them seemed to outright believe that a set of APIs made unilaterally by a single vendor would inevitably get railroaded unchanged into a standard – in and of itself a highly problematic idea – and talked about web components being “the future”, implying that every other approach, no matter how new, was “legacy” or somesuch. Remember, React and Web Components were both released at around the same time – arguably React came later – and here these dudes (almost always dudes) were strutting around calling everything else outdated and obsolete. They claimed to be the only ones properly “using the platform”. Their approach was “standard”. A “standard” implemented by a single browser, pushed by a single company, with no interest from other browsers visible to an outside observer for at least three years. This is arguably normal behaviour in tech, where a dev-rel’s thankless task of building up good vibes about an API or platform can be tanked thoroughly by a lead dev opening their mouth and managing to simultaneously piss everybody off in 140 characters dumped onto the hive of seething malice that used to be called Twitter. But, because none of us saw what may or may not have been going on behind the scenes, and because Google was even then at the very least a proto-monopolist… This all? It was not a great look! It didn’t help that React was in full promise-the-world myth-making mode. It no longer really mattered whether Web Components were superior to React or not. Web developers largely focused on React, which has always had more competent PR than most other open source projects. Another problem was that nobody else seemed to agree with Google that this specific iteration of Web Components was the future. Firefox and Safari never implemented version “zero” of Web Components. Most developers favoured React’s approach to reactive programming and composition which, arguably, became the conceptual inspiration for pretty much every reactive component framework implemented since. Everybody who adopted this version of Web Components ended up getting punished for trusting Google. To say that the Safari and Firefox teams were sceptical about web components is oversimplifying things. The template element was relatively uncontroversial compared to the rest. “Autonomous” custom elements – the ability to define brand-new elements with custom names (<my-custom-element>) – were also relatively uncontroversial. The Shadow DOM and “built-in” custom elements – letting web developers directly modify native built-in elements in situ through sub-classing – proved much more divisive. Many at the time seemed convinced that this reticence was nothing more than a form of road-blocking, that these Mozilla and Apple employees were obeying some sort of secret directive from their bosses to “slow-walk” improvements to the web, but a much simpler explanation is that their concern was genuine, because there was a lot to be concerned about. These particular changes affect the core of how the Document Object Model (DOM) works. The consequences of doing the wrong thing would be both long-lasting and far-reaching, and the web has much too many footguns already. Messing around with the composition and inheritance models of the DOM is something you should legitimately be hesitant to do. Those arguing for ill intent do have their smoking gun: Apple’s unwillingness to ship the awesome that would be built-in custom elements is, to many, clear evidence that Apple hates the web. That the rationale for doing so involved citing something so clearly bullshit-sounding as the “Liskov Substitution Principle” has frequently been mocked by web devs on social media. (Don’t laugh. Many web devs also think “Model-View-Controller”, “Separation of Concerns”, and “unit testing” sound like bullshit. The web software industry has a substantial curiosity deficit. Apologies for the “X” links, but that’s where nonsense lives, retires, and dies of old age after an active life.) But, for the purposes of this story, Liskov’s a different kind of gun: Checkov’s gun. And I’m not just saying that because I think “Liskov” sounds a bit like “Checkov” and it amuses me to link the two. This gun will be fired in the third act and not in the way the “WebKit developers hate the web” types think. It turns out the Safari team had a point. Looking from the outside in, like that creepy dude in the “Sickos” cartoon, the discussions at the time looked involved and intense. The GitHub issue with the infamous “Liskov” remark I linked to above is over 500 comments long, and it’s one of many, not to mention mailing list threads and, I presume, a bunch of calls and in person conversations. But, eventually, browser vendors settled on a design for Web Components. This “v1” of Web Components was quite incompatible with “v0”, punishing everybody who took Google at their word that their proprietary v0 would eventually become a web standard: And a bunch more changes that I won’t go into here, but suffice to say migrating from v0 to v1 was a painful process for many. Moving an existing code base that used the entire Web Component v0 stack to v1 was non-trivial. It took YouTube itself a long while to migrate. Having to drop v0 and having to redesign Web Components to address the concerns raised by Safari and Firefox did not make the more avid in the Web Components crowd humble or change their tone. If anything, from the perspective of a regular web developer (me, that is), their rhetoric seemed to escalate now they could point to Web Components being an actual standard. If you are a masochist, you should easily be able to find GitHub comments or Tweets from this period, the early years of Web Components from 2016 to 2020, where a Google employee is calling all other approaches “legacy code” or “legacy approaches” or something similar. If you were a lurker at the time in the discussion threads between them and framework implementers, you’d have noticed that their advocacy also seemed to become much more targeted. The pressure was on those making the newer web development frameworks to build them using web components, not just be compatible with them, and it looked immense. The targets of this pressure were not Facebook’s React here, but newer frameworks such as Solid and Svelte. These are made by folks that, by and large, are very much in favour of using standards if possible, whereas the React folks seem more inclined to go “meh” and do their own thing. These newer frameworks are generally much better behaved when it comes to interoperability, exposing native DOM APIs, and performance. Both Solid and Svelte even compile to Web Components meaning you can use them to implement reusable custom elements for your projects. The problem? These pro-web maintainers have differing definitions of what’s “possible” from those more avidly promoting web components. Some of that comes from the fact that Web Components seem to be largely unsuitable to implementing a functional reactive component framework, which should not be surprising since the two concepts evolved in parallel, not in sequence. It’d have been quite the coincidence if web components had happened to be a useful set of primitives for implementing something like Svelte or Solid. Quite a few of the people who build and maintain the frameworks themselves hold on to a lingering animosity because many of them feel gaslit about the capabilities of Web Components. Their perception of reality was that these standards were not useful to them at all, but the message they got – insistently – was that web components were the inevitable future of their own frameworks. This is the background that led Ryan Carniato, the author of SolidJS, to write his blog post Web Components Are Not the Future. That blog post is a reaction to a specific line of rhetoric that has gone unnoticed by most web developers because they were not the ones targeted. That’s why it looked like such an odd, angry, outburst to many and those foolish enough to support their chosen web development tech as if it were a football team took it or the reaction to it as validation that their “team” was better than the others. What’s missing from this are the reasons why React and its descendants won out over Web Components and their ecosystem. Just because you might not easily be able to use web components to implement something like SolidJS, that’s a very different kind of problem from what most regular web developers are tackling. Ryan might have a justifiable gripe against a small group of over-enthusiastic Web Components promoters, but that doesn’t answer the question that rises when you realise that React and Web Components are generationally peers – to the point of React having its first stable release in 2016 just like Web Components: Why did React win? And the answer to that, in my oh so personal opinion, isn’t “because Web Components aren’t great for specific kinds of problems, such as those framework maintainers deal with” no matter how technically reasonable that might sound. Remember, these technical observations and conclusions are popping up after React was well on its way towards resoundingly winning the popularity contest that is modern web dev. I think it comes down to a simple difference in promises. Web components promise you that you’ll be able to extend the DOM in ways that are idiomatically compatible in with the rest of the DOM. React promised us a silver bullet: unidirectional data flow would fix UI development once and for all. Magical silver bullets will always be more popular than boring old incremental improvement. React offered two benefits to organisations: Both of these promises are science-fiction, and experienced React devs as well as React maintainers are both likely to be the first to point that out. People still believed in these fictions, and many still do. Both require some explanation. React’s core innovation was to treat the UI as a virtual data structure that could be reconciled with, or rendered to, whatever stateful group of objects you were using to render the actual User Interface. This was deliberately agnostic about whether the rendering target was a Document Object Model, a hierarchy of AppKit or UIKit objects, or whatever it is that Android has got going. This meant you could structure your UI components as a set of functions or classes that together took the app’s state and returned a tree-like data structure and, because these were in theory just accepting and returning data, you could steal ideas from functional programming – immutable objects, no side effects, baby! – to make the whole process easier. Instead of complex manipulations full of potential side effects, your mental model of your GUI app would be something along the lines of: UI = f(state) Events and actions generated by the UI modify state. That triggers the f(state) part again. The data structure returned from the components is diffed with the existing UI and the UI is updated based on that diff to reflect the new state. This is what the React scene calls “unidirectional data flow” (“one-way data flow” in more recent documentation) because data only flows from state to UI, whereas the data that flows from the UI back into state is labelled “actions” or “events”, which means they aren’t data, silly. No, the data the user is typing into the form isn’t data. It’s an action. Here, read this rambling blog post and library of old-style Twitter threads that explain it. Of course, you need to be smart enough to understand that data isn’t data except when it’s data, and it’s always going in one direction except when it’s going in the other, in which case it’s a cycle, which makes it all one direction. Something about drawing it as a circle somehow makes people miss the fact that stuff is obviously flowing in multiple directions. Not just up and down, but sideways within a component and often React apps just completely drop the pretence and shove the data directly to where it belongs using things like the Context API. But, sure, the data only flows one way. You just need to have curious definitions of the words “flow”, “one”, “way”, and “data”. That, however, isn’t the problem with the idea. It’s actually a neat idea that forces you to rethink some of the basic principles of GUI software development. The problem is that it’s pretty much only an idea: a myth. What we get in practice is almost always quite different in very important ways. The issues, in no particular order: But, Baldur, you don’t understand! You don’t get React! Oh, I understand. When I use a model object that’s connected to a view object using a coordinating object (controller, presenter, or whatever), then sure that’s MVC or MVP. But, when you do it, it’s a parent component that’s using the context API and hooks to coordinate a state object with a functional child component. Effectively, as soon as you try to do meaningful work with React, the “unidirectional data flow” ceases to be an architecture and becomes an origin myth. Meanwhile the actual architecture is whatever uncoordinated “I can’t believe it’s not MVC” hocus pocus is popular in the React scene the week the project was started. For a very brief period, React’s tag line was something like “The V in MVC”, but they quickly gave that up because there’s so much more in React than just the components. They have an entire array of state and event management tools that together assemble whatever app architecture you want. React has always been the whole kit and caboodle, not just a “V”. It’s just never enforced a single, coherent architecture and instead provided hooks and tools with no direction and soft boundaries. But it promised magic, and people didn’t seem to notice that, in time, making and maintaining a React app was just as much work, if not more, as those made using more traditional approaches. Moreover, React apps that were explicitly structured using the Model-View-Controller architecture from the ground up tended to, in my personal opinion as an extremely biased outside observer, be less problematic over time than those that went all in on the unidirectional gravy train. A promise of magic is always going to be more popular than promising to give you sensible – the “wear practical shoes, it’s going to be a long walk” kind of sensible – steps forward. Even if Web Components had met with universal approval among browser vendors right out of the gate, it’s unlikely they would have ever won out over the promise of making the development of dynamic user interfaces magically easier. It should not be surprising that more modern component frameworks, ones that aren’t saddled with a largely fictional core concept, such as Vue, Svelte, or SolidJS are by almost every metric faster, lighter, and more productive than React. Preact even manages to be a far superior “React” than React itself. React has become a bloated carcass of false promises, misleading claims, and unending layers of backwards compatibility – the wrong kind of backwards compatibility, as they still occasionally break your fucking code when updating. Pretty much anything else is a better tool for pretty much any web development task. There’s also more genuinely useful innovation going on everywhere except React. SolidJS came up with signals, a genuinely interesting method for handling state. Preact adopted it and arguably came up with a more interoperable implementation of the idea. Vue and Svelte both hew closer to web norms in interesting ways. If you want innovation and experimentation, there’s a lot of it going around. Just not in React. Promises of magic only go so far. Since the consensus of the overall effect that React has had on the web is currently ranging from “on the whole, probably not great” to “the only thing that would be worse for the web would be a comet wiping out all civilisation, and even that would be a blessed relief,” if that were all, React would not be nearly as dominant in the web software industry as it still is today. That’s where commodifying developers comes in. In basic terms, what management wants is the ability to add, remove, or move around staff while pretending that said staff is largely interchangeable and that the moving around doesn’t mess things up in and of itself. This is the case for most modern companies, not just the ones in tech. Any form of expertise or specialisation makes that idea even more fictional than it already is. Employers generally love whatever scheme they find that can narrow the skill sets required to do a task down to something that can be clearly defined in market terms. One way to do that is by requiring specific degrees and certifications. Another is to standardise on using specific tools and platforms and hiring for those. You don’t try to hire people with good problem-solving skills, an ability for writing clearly, an affinity for numbers, or an understanding of how computers work that helps them pick up new apps quickly. You hire for skills in “Word” and “Excel”. That lets you hire quickly, fire quickly, and move people around as if they were, I don’t know, Legos or something. (Sorry, “Lego bricks”, he corrects himself before the pedants light their torches and grab their pitchforks.) This is hard to accomplish in software development. The entire job is basically discovering and solving poorly-defined problems with squishy human elements at its centre. React stepped in just in time to help managers en masse fake their way to a promotion during a low-interest-rate bubble. Much like “Word” and “Excel” have become the “fungibility” stand-ins for “can write clearly” and “understands numbers”, React has become a stand-in for “UI software development”. It hides the complexities of what’s happening underneath a layer of abstractions. Instead of learning a host of DOM querying and manipulation APIs or the workings of platforms like UIKit, you just return JSX. Instead of exposing the various nuances and intricacies of event handling on each platform, you get one form of event delegation and you’re going to like it. The JSX data structures are so abstracted away from the actual platform that they even offer approaches for you to pretend there isn’t any difference between a web, iOS, and Android app and let you target (or try to target) all with a single code base. React developers interact with a drastically simplified view of the world. Because that simplified view has limitations, the underlying platforms push their way into the job with alarming regularity. But because the point of hiring for React is to not hire people with the specialised skills to deal with the nuances of underlying platform, most of the time everybody reaches for a dependency instead. Something made by somebody with a deeper understanding of the underlying platform that packages up a set of solutions that those with full-on React blinkers can use. This heavy reliance on dependencies compounds React’s many pre-existing performance problems. The bloat of these web apps isn’t accidental but a by-product of how React is used by management. (I’ve written about this before, for those who are curious.) Understanding how the DOM works is a hard requirement for using tools to extend the DOM. This made Web Components a non-starter. Web Components didn’t help enable the massive growth in head count that drove much of the decision-making in tech from 2011-2022. Bear this in mind below, when I go into some of the technical limitations of Web Components. Those limitations are not the reasons why React won. React ended up the winner because it devalued software developers and made promises it could never fulfil. If that were all, then web components would just be a textbook case of over-aggressive promotion and hubris leading to self-sabotage, and a useful but limited technology losing out primarily because of the market’s many dysfunctions. Both are a regular occurrence in tech and software development. But has had other consequences. It has fractured the online web development community. The React-versus-everybody-else schism is obvious, but the other schisms are arguably more tragic. Specifically, drama surrounding Web Components and a steady parade of similar events has fractured the part of the community that is trying to get the industry to stop using what has now become the actual legacy framework: React. Instead of a united front that promotes a set of approaches as alternatives to React, each with differing optimal use cases, we now have three factions that do not collaborate nearly as much as they should: The differences between these groups are not technical. WebC and Svelte both use single file HTML components and compile to HTML, CSS, and JS, usually mediated through a chosen site generator – “meta-framework” if you will – Eleventy and SvelteKit respectively, and they both include custom elements as compile targets. Any debate that presupposes a fundamental technical difference, beyond just their relative sizes, between these two frameworks is already in the wilderness. Using Lit is not morally superior to using Vue. Different frameworks have different trade-offs and, yeah, that does mean that sometimes one is a more productive choice for a situation than the other. Sometimes that means that Lit, Eleventy with WebC, or Enhance, are the better choices. Sometimes it’s Vue, SolidJS, or Svelte. The core difference between the second and third groups is that the third group, like SolidJS for example, often tried at some point to integrate various parts of the Web Components stack into the implementation of their projects and became very frustrated with the technology and now many of them seem to be quite bitter about web components as a result. They were promised platform fundamentals that – because they were the future of frameworks – would work as building blocks of their own projects. This is a needless divide. “Use the platform” developers, web component frameworks, and modern reactive frameworks can all use and benefit from web components today. You can use a web component in Svelte and you can use Svelte to make a web component. WebC will work well using a Svelte component that has been compiled to a custom element. Those who eschew frameworks can use components made in either in their projects. Web Components, if the goal was to improve interoperability and reuse, are a smashing success. They are an incredibly useful building block for modern websites that’s only going to become more useful now that we have broader support for form-participating custom elements. Lea Verou does a good job of explaining what Web Components are good for in her own post on this topic: Frameworks already use native HTML elements in their components. Web components extend what native elements can do, and thus make crafting project-specific components easier across all frameworks (as well as no frameworks). I tried to find a better way to phrase this, but Lea already came up with the perfect framing. Most devs could just stop here, read Lea’s post, nod a few times as they scroll, and be done with it. (Though, you’re most of the way through this behemoth of an essay by now, so you might as well read i to the end.) This is how Web Components work. This is how we should be using web components and frameworks. (And, by the way, the fact that the Font Awesome people have hired her and Zach Leatherman have turned my scepticism about Web Awesome into outright enthusiasm, even if Zach isn’t involved in it directly. I’m very much looking forward to seeing what they and Font Awesome do in the future.) However, the underlying technical reasons why web components are a bad fit for some software architectures are still there, largely unexplored. I’ve had to use web components quite a bit, myself. I largely like them. I even see the appeal of the Shadow DOM, despite its many issues. I’ve used web components (no framework), Lit (a framework designed with web components in mind), and Svelte (a reactive component framework) for complex projects, and I’ve experimented with a lot of the rest with prototypes. But, in my experience, using web components, with or without Lit, to implement a big project end-to-end was usually harder and more complicated than using a reactive framework for the same purposes. It was also sometimes harder than using no framework at all. When people say “use the platform” they aren’t just talking about the handful of Web Component APIs. The platform has more to offer than Custom Elements and Shadow DOMs. Web components can be suboptimal for many projects for reasons that are very similar to the reasons why they aren’t useful for the internal implementation of frameworks like Solid or Svelte, but I can’t speak for framework implementers, only for myself. The first issue has to do with how web components interact with the rest of the Document Object Model (DOM). Every API that’s commonly bundled under the “Web Components” umbrella is defined in terms of their alterations to the DOM: Shadow DOM, custom elements, even the <template> element to some degree. Using them requires injecting them into the DOM tree at specific points. That quickly becomes problematic because the semantics of the DOM are highly dependent on specific hierarchies. The list could go on forever because this is a fundamental part of how both HTML and SVG are designed, so it’s happening throughout both. The DOM fundamentally uses hierarchy for composition. The same element will have different functionality and meaning depending on what parents it has. To use object-oriented terms, the DOM relies heavily on both composition (“X is extended by having a Y”) and inheritance (“X is extended by being a Y and inheriting its features”) in a complex system that does not easily allow for intermediaries. A list only works if the parent ordered or unordered list element is in a direct “has a” relationship with child list elements. Direct parent-child element relationships is one of the building blocks of DOM composition. Components, as an architectural concept, need to add behaviour to and render into these kinds of hierarchies without breaking their structure. Components in many reactive frameworks solve this by not injecting themselves into the DOM at all. They return elements that the rendering context will integrate into the DOM, but they generally won’t be a part of the explicit DOM hierarchy themselves. You don’t want a ListComponent to wrap the li elements it returns in <list-component> tags because that would break the semantics of the DOM. The list would no longer function as a proper list. Components in these frameworks generally exist as an abstraction outside the DOM. A rendering context takes that abstraction (often a “virtual” DOM) and render to the “actual” DOM. That many developers misuse frameworks doesn’t change the fact that modern frameworks are specifically structured around the ability to deliver semantic and accessible DOMs without breaking the parent-child composition that’s integral to modern HTML. This is React’s positive legacy to the world of web development: a way of making components that don’t interfere with the Document Object Model’s core methods for composition and extension. That positive legacy has been carried forward and improved by modern web frameworks. Once you lose the mythical “unidirectional data flow” baggage, and aren’t trying to build the universal UI engine, “return a data structure that gets diffed and merged with a corresponding part of the DOM” is actually a neat and productive idea that fits extremely well with traditional approaches to working with the DOM, such as template rendering. If you look towards approaches to state management that are more akin to the matching up of models with views through some coordination, functional reactive components actually begin to look kind of awesome. They aren’t quite the magic solution React promised, but they are a meaningful and substantial improvement. That’s where we’re at with modern frameworks. That’s what many of the Web Components frameworks are trying for as well, even though they are held back by how custom elements inevitably inject themselves into the DOM, because custom elements are defined in terms of, well, custom DOM elements. That “injection” can make the DOM dysfunctional by interfering with the hierarchy many elements require. It took years for them to finally fix some of the issues Shadow DOM has with forms, and we still occasionally have issues with it interfering with aria- property references, which are used to properly expose the UI to accessibility tools, and labelling across components. How selection APIs interact with Shadow DOMs are still a mess (though hopefully not for long). Custom elements can’t easily be used to render list or table child elements directly. They don’t work at all for extending SVG, which is the only vector drawing surface available to the broader web. Even if you pretend Safari doesn’t exist and just look at Firefox’s progress, their support for form-associated elements was released in 2021, five years after the “v1” release of web components. It’s been a long road. These standards seem legitimately hard to implement, which is what you’d expect once you realise they’re messing with some of the core structures of the web platform. This issue with hierarchical interjection is why you occasionally hear framework types say that web components should mostly be used as “leaf nodes”. If the web component has no children visible to the framework – is a “leaf” not a branch – then it can’t break the hierarchy. It’s a useful rule of thumb if you’re working in the framework world and fits well with how Lea Verou defined the relationship between web components and frameworks in the post I quoted above. The CSS property display: contents; also goes some way to alleviate this issue as it can be used to effectively “disappear” the custom element from the rendering tree, so it doesn’t interfere with, for example, the parent-child relationship between a <ul> and <li> element. This doesn’t address the SVG gap, but if that ends up being the only big issue remaining, then Web Components are in much better shape than many expected they’d ever be in. But, we’re still missing the ability to create custom elements that extend built-in elements. That would be the last remaining issue to solve and would let you deliver web components that render elements like <li> or <td> without interfering with the hierarchy. It is the key to perfecting web components and bringing about the future we were promised. Or is it? There’s reason to believe that the Safari team might be have been right to refuse to implement the is attribute and not let custom elements extend built-ins. When you work with markup, hierarchy can serve as a very powerful form of composition. But, as I outlined earlier, that hasn’t worked too well for custom elements until fairly recently. In practice, their inclusion in the DOM hierarchy often interferes with the composition of built-in elements with little benefit to the custom element itself. Beyond that, there’s a tension inherent in how custom elements were designed. They are simultaneously late- and early bound. They are dynamically late-bound to an element name, <my-custom-element> for example, that then automatically works in the markup and DOM. A script can define a custom element with any valid name it wants. A component or function that renders HTML doesn’t need to import that script directly or have any knowledge of the custom element. The developer can change the composition of a DOM tree simply by mapping a different custom element implementation to that name. The communication between the custom element and its surrounding context is done through messages – events – attributes, and object properties. None of the elements in the surrounding context need to even be aware that the implementation of the custom element has been switched to a different one. This is a form of late binding, or loose coupling, and late-binding is extremely useful for building applications with user interfaces because it lends itself to building complex functionality through composition without, well, binding you to a rigid structure that can be hard to alter as the design realities of the interface are surfaced. You can still easily modify the project as the app gets tested and user feedback pours in. As Alan Kay explained: Late binding allows ideas learned late in project development to be reformulated into the project with exponentially less effort than traditional early binding system. This is a good thing. At the same time, the implementation of custom elements is based on highly specific inheritance that can’t be easily remapped. If you’re rendering in a browser, the HTMLElement class is always going to be HTMLElement. Even though you can technically replace it – JavaScript is a late-bound language as designed – doing so risks breaking the DOM entirely. That means that the implementation and state management of a web component is tightly coupled to its ancestor classes and that will generally make reformulations and alterations harder. Moreover, the DOM’s existing class inheritance tree was not made with web developer subclassing in mind. Its inheritance is complicated and a mess. A few elements actually share interfaces, such as the <q> and <blockquote> elements sharing the HTMLQuoteElement interface and a whole mess of legacy elements sharing the HTMLUnknownElement interface. This complicates matters. Extending built-in elements also has an extremely controversial history and frameworks messing around with built-in language objects, such as Array, have directly hindered platform development and standardisation multiple times in the past. But subclassing those should be fine, right? The subclasses should break anything, right? Well, this is where Liskov’s Gun goes “blam!” because the answer to that is “probably not”. Let’s look at the Liskov substitution principle itself, the one cited by that WebKit developer all those years ago: Subtype Requirement: Let ⁠ ϕ ( x ) ⁠ be a property provable about objects ⁠ x ⁠ of type T. Then ⁠ ϕ ( y ) ⁠ should be true for objects ⁠ y ⁠ of type S where S is a subtype of T. Well that clears that right up! So clear. So obvious. That doesn’t sound like gobbledygook to regular humans at all! Effectively, paraphrasing the above-linked Wikipedia page into human(ish) terms, what it means is that if S is a subclass of T objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without altering the correctness of the program. That is, if you subclass HTMLInputElement, instances of your subclass need to work correctly whenever they’re substituted for an instance of the original HTMLInputElement and, because JavaScript as a language isn’t really able to offer any such guarantee, this principle can’t easily be enforced in the browser runtime. So, you’re left with debating the principle itself, which is an argument that can definitely be made on an abstract level, but once you narrow it down to DOM elements specifically, I think the overall principle becomes quite compelling. Remember the section above about how the DOM uses hierarchy (“has a” relationships) for composition? How elements such as <table>, <li>, and <input> to name a few, need specific parent-child relationships to function properly? Well, the built-in subclasses that provide the interfaces these elements use are an important part of making that composition work. One of the more important uses cases for web components is to let people implement and distribute reusable widget that are interoperable across multiple projects, frameworks, or even organisations. Much of the standardisation work surrounding web components has been towards ensuring that these packaged widgets don’t interfere with the outside DOM and that they won’t be interfered with by it in return. That’s what the Shadow DOM is for. Because of this, you can take a <custom-date-picker> widget and include it in your project without much worry, provided you aren’t using it to wrap elements that require a direct parent-child relationship with specific other elements to work. Now that we have broad support for form-associated elements, this mostly works and provides a good foundation for interesting projects such as a new generation of open source widget libraries. But if you take an <input is="custom-date-picker"> element, you don’t have the same assurances. You don’t know whether you can actually use it in all the same ways you can use a regular input element. JavaScript can’t offer you that guarantee. Remember that every built-in custom element begins life as their original parent class before they get upgraded by the custom element script, so it could start off being compatible but then suddenly become incompatible when a script loads. Seen from this perspective, broad adoption of custom elements that extend built-in elements does seem likely to cause serious and hard-to-solve bugs in a non-trivial proportion of the projects who would use them. Or, in the words of Ryosuke Niwa, the WebKit dev who originally cited the Liskov substitution principle, writing on the topic eight years ago: One fundamental problem is that subclassing a subclass of HTMLInputElement or HTMLImageElement often leads to a violation of the Liskov substitution principle over time. Because they’re builtin elements, they’re very likely to be extended in the future. Imagine that we had this feature supported before type=date was added. Then your subclass of HTMLInputElement must also support type=date in order to satisfy the substitution principle. Similarly, imagine we had added this feature before srcset was added to HTMLImageElement and you wrote a subclass of HTMLImageElement. Then not supporting srcset results in the violation of the principle again. In addition, none of the builtin elements are designed to be subclassed, and in fact, we don’t have builtin subclasses of HTMLElement that are also builtins. This limits the usefulness of any sort of subclassing. Furthermore, we don’t have any hooks for the processing models and internal states of builtin elements such as the dirtiness of HTMLImageElement’s value and when and how HTMLInputElement picks the appropriate image. I mean, yeah. When it’s put this way, it does sound problematic. Overall, class inheritance versus composition is a classic question of trade-offs in software development and in software with graphical user interfaces – especially web-based ones – I’d argue that inheritance is the wrong trade-off for this task in particular because it’s interfering with an already complex inheritance system, which in turn can complicate even further how custom elements interact with the hierarchical composition of markup. Reactive components, as implemented by most modern frameworks, make a different trade-off. They tend to be functional, even if they aren’t implemented as functions. They still inherit React’s issue of only working when rendered to a DOM with all the side effects that entails, but because most of them are thinner abstractions than React and target fewer platforms, I’d argue that the issue has become more manageable. You render to a DOM element and test that element as a data structure. With React you often don’t even know if the final target is a DOM element, HTML string, Android view, or UIKit view. Instead of the subclasses you have to deal with in Web Components, you often have a series of function invocations that treat the returned DOM representation as, ideally, side-effect-free data they can modify and pass on. Immutable data structures are popular in among this crowd for good reasons. The representation that’s returned usually isn’t an actual DOM fragment, but gets resolved and rendered into the “real” DOM by a rendering context. To quote Mayank I can create an <Input> primitive component that wraps an <input> element. And I can create a <ThemedInput> component that wraps the primitive <Input>. Then someone else can take my <ThemedInput> and create a <PasswordInput> on top of it. After all of these components are resolved and initialized, the final DOM tree should really only contain a single <input> element. The intermediate components are not (always) relevant for the DOM tree. The browser doesn’t care how the code on my website is organized. In other words, components are totally made up. That doesn’t mean components are not useful; just that they exist in a different plane. This is what makes it possible to compose all the way up to a <Page> component Trying to accomplish this with web components is tricky and the end result is usually a deeply nested tree of custom elements. You can hide some of that in Shadow DOMs but that introduces a new set of problems caused by the Shadow DOM itself. Using web components as native-like components that are entirely external to the rendering process bypasses this in part, but if you are authoring the “leaf” web components yourself, I’d argue that the emphasis on inheritance and de-emphasis of composition will make the creation of complex widgets harder and more error-prone than it would be with a framework’s component system. The interoperability benefits and the fact you’re building with web standards, which generally do not change once they’ve been shipped across multiple browsers, gives you stability and should lower development costs in the long run. For many, if not most, organisations this trade-off should be worthwhile. But there’s a good chance that using web components to implement the core architecture of your app could make the task harder. You’re likely to have to lean heavily on inheritance and classes and eschew composition for implementing the logic and flow of the application. It absolutely can be done, either by minimising your use of class inheritance or by being thoughtful about it, but one of the reasons why reactive component frameworks, even though all the modern ones are considerably younger than web components as a technology, are so popular among devs, even the developers that don’t have to use React for organisational or political reasons, is that their architecture makes these tasks a little bit simpler. Interlocking functional components that use signals for state, for example, are easier to use and reason about than interlocking class-based web components that use properties and events for state and reactivity. This does not matter that much if the web component is a “leaf” node, the last stop on the line so to speak, but it begins to matter a lot if these components are being use throughout an app’s overall structure. Thankfully, you don’t have to use a framework to get these features. You can write functional components that use signals for reactive state using either standalone lit-html or uhtml tagged template libraries. You don’t need the full framework baggage. Some frameworks, such as Enhance offer similar capabilities that are functional and reactive out of the box. We have a spectrum of options that range from using only platform APIs, to specialised libraries, to lightweight frameworks, and all the way to fully-fledged “batteries included” web development frameworks. One size very much does not fit all. We should feel free to choose the toolset that’s appropriate for our task and our project. We should not saddle ourselves with unnecessary work out of habit or misplaced loyalties towards one “team” or another. And none of us should be using React. Web components don’t really work for quite a few of the tasks we were initially told they would be good for. Pointing that out isn’t a criticism of the web as a platform. Nor does it imply that you should always use a framework or that you can’t get anything done using just platform APIs with a small selection of libraries. All it means is that this particular slice of the web platform turned out to have limitations we need to be mindful of when we do our work. Given the limitations I went into above, it doesn’t surprise me that many framework implementers found it hard or impossible to use web components to implement a framework for reactive functional components. There’s a clear mismatch there. It also casts some light on what framework maintainers mean when they say that Web Components are a bad direction for web development. If web components, specifically, represent the future of web development, then it’s a future filled with awkward class inheritance hierarchies, even deeper markup hierarchies, and layers of code whose only purpose it is to mitigate how custom elements and the Shadow DOM interfere with regular HTML and SVG composition. It’s a vision of a future where web development is substantially harder, less powerful, and less productive. Fortunately, I don’t think that’s a future anybody wants or is even working towards. Web Components are great for what they are, genuinely great, but they don’t represent the extent or promise of the platform. There’s so much more happening. Recent additions to the web platform are squarely aimed at a much brighter future, one that helps developers implement great experiences without sacrificing usability, performance, or accessibility. That’s just to name a few and does not even begin to go into the many potential future standards that might improve things even further. Web standardisation today is in a much better place than it was a few years ago and instead of pushing the web harder in the direction of web components, most people seem content to sand off their rough edges and make them work better with the rest of the platform, using features such as Declarative Shadow DOM and ElementInternals. We’re letting web components “be their best selves”. Over time, these improvements to the platform might together change how we do web development in meaningful ways: It’s increasingly popular to rail against the existence of web apps. People get angry about how much crap gets loaded into your average website. The web is filled with ads and tracking software that are making it less and less usable. Quite a few sites are also implemented using bloated frameworks that would be barely acceptable if they were being used to implement a revolutionary killer app but are completely beyond the pale for building a regular website or dashboard. The web is a mess that seems to only be getting less usable and messier by the minute. You’d be justified in dismissing the entire concept of web apps: Websites don’t need this. This is all bullshit. But none of the tech I’ve discussed is really to blame for what has happened to the web. That lies squarely with advertising as a business model and React’s unique dysfunctions. Web Components, new web APIs, and newer more modern frameworks of every kind represent our path out of the web crisis and shouldn’t be rejected just because they involve JavaScript. This isn’t just a question of fixing web’s current issues. We need web apps. We both need more web apps, and we need more capable web apps. Mainstream Operating Systems – Android, ChromeOS, Windows, macOS, iOS, and the rest – are increasingly closed platforms whose primary software markets are managed through conservative and puritanical central committees: their hidebound App Stores. The platforms themselves are constantly shifting and changing depending on what fad the OS vendor is chasing to boost its stock price. For example, many iOS app developers sacrifice months of every year updating their apps to keep up with platform changes. If they don’t, they lose customers because their apps are broken or perceived to be broken. These are months they could be using to implement genuine improvements to their apps and to build their businesses. Those businesses can only use the specific business models approved by a platform’s central committee, are only allowed to include the content deemed morally appropriate by that central committee, and need to have every update and minute elements of its marketing strategy approved by faceless serfs working in a soul-draining bureaucracy. More importantly, these institutions also do not stand up to authoritarian powers. They will bow down to the demands of China, and they will not stand in the way of an authoritarian takeover of a democratic country. We need web apps. Web apps are the only open and standardised GUI software development and distribution platform that’s available to us. Discarding them out of spite or annoyance is exactly the sort of situation that the phrase “don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater” was coined for. We need this. And, thankfully, web standards are slowly but surely stepping up. Now we only need to make sure that OS vendors, such as Google or Apple, don’t stand in its way. And we need to make sure we don’t stand in its way.

Title: Boeing Strike, Nvidia Highs And FOMC Minutes

TOPSHOT - Union members react as Aerospace Machinists District 751 President Jon Holden (out of ... [+] frame) announces that union members rejected a proposed Boeing contract and will go on strike, following voting results at their union hall in Seattle, Washington, on September 12, 2024. Boeing workers in the Seattle region overwhelmingly voted to strike on September 12, rejecting a contract the embattled aviation giant characterized as a boon for staff given the company's stressed financial condition. (Photo by Jason Redmond / AFP) (Photo by JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) Key Takeaways Stocks staged broad rallies on Tuesday with the S&P 500 jumping nearly 1% and Nasdaq Composite gaining 1.45% Small cap stops were flat on the day and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3%. Markets have been swayed a bit by activity in China where some mixed messaging from the government has caused wide swings in prices. After recently announcing aggressive stimulus measures that boosted stock prices, many expected a furthering of those plans this week. However, when Chinese authorities hosted a press conference Tuesday, hopes for yet more stimulus were dashed. A couple weeks ago I made the comment that it felt as if China was throwing everything, including the kitchen sink, at their economy. The failure to announce any additional plans on Tuesday brings up concerns that China is running out of options. This is still an evolving story and one worth monitoring as it could have implications for U.S. markets. Back here at home, there are a few stocks I'll be following today. Boeing announced it was breaking off talks with its machinist union. The company withdrew its most recent offer to raise wages by 30% and as of now, there are no plans to restart the negotiations. In the wake of the contract negotiations breakdown, S&P Global Ratings said it may lower its rating on Boeing bonds to junk status which would likely be a significant blow to the company whose stock is already down around 40% for the year. Shares of Google parent company, Alphabet are lower by 0.5% in premarket. The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced they may seek to have the company broken up, alleging the current structure creates a monopoly. This is an interesting story not just in terms of what happens to Alphabet, but also, what type of precedent this may set for other companies, some of which comprise the Magnificent Seven. Should the company be broken apart, I would not be surprised if it spurred activity around companies such as Meta or even Apple. The question I would have is whether those companies seek spinoffs before possibly being forcibly broken apart, or if the companies would instead fight the DOJ. I actually believe these types of breakups, although disruptive in the short term, can have potential to benefit shareholders, so it is something to keep an eye on. Constellation Energy has seen its stock surge nearly 80% since early August. While we don't typically think of energy stocks as exciting, the sector is in play because of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The computing power for AI and energy required is creating a lot of interesting activity in the sector. In addition to established players in the field, new entrants are also emerging. Companies such as Oklo Incorporated, whose stock has more than doubled from a low of $5.35 just last month, are drawing attention to a sector not typically considered as high growth. Speaking of AI, chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor reported strong earnings overnight. That stock is indicated higher by just under 1% in premarket. The positive news also has shares of Nvidia indicated higher by 1% and trading at a new all-time high. We'll see if a breakout to new highs has the ability to excite the broader market as well. For today, in addition to the stocks mentioned above, I am particularly interested in the release of the most recent Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from last month's reading. As I mentioned on Monday, given the magnitude of the cut to interest rates but continued indication of strength in the economy, I think these minutes will garner more scrutiny than we typically see. I also think the minutes will give some context to tomorrow's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report and Friday's Producer Price Index (PPI). Friday will also be the start to earnings season with both JP Morgan and Wells Fargo scheduled to report.

Title: Evercore ISI stock rated Outperform on Amazon amid Kuiper costs
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/evercore-isi-stock-rated-outperform-on-amazon-amid-kuiper-costs-93CH-3655418
Time Published: 2024-10-09T12:15:51Z
Full Content:
On Wednesday, Evercore ISI maintained a positive outlook on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares, reiterating an Outperform rating and a $240.00 price target. The firm's analysis highlights the impending launch of satellites for Amazon's Project Kuiper, which is set to start in the fourth quarter. Project Kuiper is Amazon's initiative to provide satellite-based Internet service, and it has garnered attention due to its significant investment and potential impact on the company's financials. According to Evercore ISI, Amazon has committed $10 billion to the project and is estimated to spend over $10 billion on 94 planned launches over the next two years. The analyst anticipates Kuiper-related losses to increase substantially in the December quarter, estimating a jump from roughly $250 million in the second quarter to between $600 million and $1 billion. This projection leads to the belief that current Street Operating Income estimates for the fourth quarter may be overly optimistic. Looking ahead to 2025, the firm estimates that losses for Kuiper could soar to between $5 billion and $6 billion before the project starts generating substantial revenue. Despite these significant costs, Evercore ISI suggests that the market opportunity for Kuiper could be undervalued. The firm points to the rapid revenue growth of similar services, like Starlink, and the attractive economics of the satellite Internet segment, which boasts EBITDA margins of 30%-50% among existing competitors. Evercore ISI also notes Amazon's competitive advantages, such as its strong consumer presence and the extensive ground infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The firm posits that even a 1% penetration of Amazon's Global Prime member base could translate to almost $750 million in annual revenue for Kuiper. Additionally, the firm expects Amazon to reveal improvements in core U.S. Retail margins during the Kuiper investment phase, which could mitigate some investor concerns regarding the project's costs. In other recent news, Cantor Fitzgerald has raised its price target for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to $670, maintaining an Overweight rating based on anticipated surpassing of third-quarter earnings and fourth-quarter guidance. The firm's optimism stems from strong advertising checks and potential growth from features like Reels, A+, and personalized recommendations. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's antitrust lawsuit against Amazon will proceed, despite Amazon's request for dismissal. The core allegations involve anti-competitive tactics and an algorithm that allegedly inflated prices for U.S. consumers. TD Cowen has maintained its Buy rating on Amazon shares, projecting a 10.7% year-over-year increase in third-quarter revenue growth, primarily driven by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising revenues. Similarly, Mizuho Securities has reiterated an Outperform rating on Amazon, with a price target of $240.00, citing increased investment estimates in AWS and a revised upward spending forecast. Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) Automotive, backed by Amazon, has revised its full-year production forecast downward due to a parts shortage. The company now anticipates producing between 47,000 and 49,000 vehicles for the year, a reduction from the previously projected 57,000 units. As Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) embarks on its ambitious Project Kuiper, InvestingPro data provides additional context to the company's financial position. Despite the anticipated losses from the satellite project, Amazon's revenue growth remains robust, with a 12.32% increase over the last twelve months to $604.33 billion. This growth underscores the company's ability to invest in future technologies while maintaining its core business strength. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that Amazon is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, with a PEG ratio of 0.19. This suggests that the market may not be fully pricing in the company's growth potential, including the long-term benefits of Project Kuiper. Additionally, Amazon's strong return over the last five years, as noted in another InvestingPro Tip, indicates a track record of successful long-term investments. While the Kuiper project will undoubtedly impact Amazon's financials, the company's operating income margin of 9.0% and EBITDA of $104.05 billion over the last twelve months demonstrate its current profitability. This financial cushion may help Amazon weather the initial investment phase of Project Kuiper. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Amazon, providing deeper insights into the company's financial health and market position.

Talk about an undecided market. As of the close on Monday, October 7, in four of the past five days, the closing range of the S&P 500 (SPX) was 13.6 points. That is two-tenths of 1% based on the price of the index. For the Nasdaq, the range in four out of five days was 14.76 points or eight one-hundredths of 1%. The Nasdaq 100's (QQQ) range was 0.83 points or two-tenths of 1%. The Nasdaq and the QQQ tested their 21-day exponential a few times and remain perilously close to breaking that average, while the SPX has come close to the average on several occasions intraday. Third-quarter EPS season is now underway and the next three weeks will be very heavy with earnings reports. Just prior to and just after earnings reports, companies are in a blackout period. During that time, a company cannot repurchase its stock. So in April/early May, July/early August, October/early November, and January/early February, there is an absence of demand that can create weakness in the overall market. First-quarter 2024 share buybacks on the S&P 500 were $237 billion and for the 12-months ending March 2024, buybacks were $817 billion.

October 09, 2024 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Oct. 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ today announced distributions for the YieldMax™ ETFs listed in the table below. The performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (833) 378-0717. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs”. Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). * The inception date for PLTY is October 7, 2024. 1 All YieldMax™ ETFs shown in the table above (except YMAX and YMAG) have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. YMAX and YMAG have a Management Fee of 0.29% and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of 0.99% for a gross expense ratio of 1.28%. “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses” are indirect fees and expenses that the Fund incurs from investing in the shares of other investment companies, namely other YieldMax™ ETFs. 2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on October 8, 2024. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future. 3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ended September 30. 2024, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period. 4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. 5 As of the date hereof, distributions for the following ETFs have included return of investor capital: TSLY, OARK, APLY, AMZY, NVDY, GOOY, JPMO, XOMO, PYPY, CONY, DISO, FBY, MSFO, NFLY, SQY, AMDY, MRNY, AIYY, MSTY, ULTY, YMAX, YMAG, YBIT, SNOY, CRSH and GDXY. For additional information, please visit www.YieldMaxETFs.com/TaxInfo. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Standardized Performance For YMAX, click here. For YMAG, click here. For TSLY, click here. For OARK, click here. For APLY, click here.

There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs and ZEGA Financial is their sub-adviser. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX and YMAG generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTY), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer time periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given time period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: MGE Energy, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MGEE) institutional investors lost 3.2% over the past week but have profited from longer-term gains
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mge-energy-inc-nasdaq-mgee-102311006.html
Time Published: 2024-10-09T10:23:11Z
Full Content:
Significantly high institutional ownership implies MGE Energy's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 14 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have bought recently A look at the shareholders of MGE Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGEE) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 62% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$3.2b last week. Still, the 27% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of MGE Energy, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for MGE Energy Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. MGE Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at MGE Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. MGE Energy is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 16% of shares outstanding. With 13% and 4.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. After doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. While there is some analyst coverage, the company is probably not widely covered. So it could gain more attention, down the track. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of MGE Energy, Inc. in their own names. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own US$6.1m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. With a 38% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over MGE Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with MGE Energy , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

Title: Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-wegovy-zepbound-weight-loss-drugs-cost-effects-1851660134
Time Published: 2024-10-09T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
A highly effective class of weight loss drug has taken the world by storm, as medications like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound become household names. These drugs, originally meant to treat diabetes, have become widely known for their slimming side effects. Surging demand for these drugs has transformed pharmaceutical giants Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into some of the world’s most valuable companies — potentially paving the way for the first $1 trillion pharma firms. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for highly-coveted treatments will reach $105 billion by 2030. This guide will break down everything you need to know about these drugs, their differences, how they work, and their potential side effects. Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound are all considered incretin medications, drugs that influence a group of hormones that impact insulin production in the body. These treatments work by spiking certain gut hormones that regulate blood sugar levels. Incretin drugs were originally only meant to be used for treating diabetes, but because they have also been found to reduce a user’s appetite, they have now been officially approved for weight loss and other health benefits. Ozempic is a blockbuster diabetes drug produced by the Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk. It is part of a class of drugs known as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). This class of drugs was first developed in the 1990s when scientists identified a hormone-like molecule in the venom of a Gila monster, a lizard native to the American Southwest, that stimulated insulin secretion. Fast-forward a decade later, and companies like Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) started selling synthetic versions of this molecule to treat diabetes. In December of 2017, the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide (brand name Ozempic) for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. Ozempic is one of the most advanced versions of these drugs currently on the market, as previous versions required at least once-daily injections. Ozempic is administered just once a week. Because the drug regulates blood sugar levels, reduces appetite, and slows down stomach emptying, one of its side effects is weight loss. After Ozempic’s slimming side effects became widely known, doctors started prescribing it off-label to treat a condition outside the drug’s official approval: weight loss. Novo Nordisk also tested semaglutide, the active ingredient behind Ozempic, in higher doses as a weight loss drug. In 2021, the FDA approved these higher doses of semaglutide, under the brand name Wegovy, for weight loss. As a result, in the United States and some other countries, semaglutide is prescribed and sold as Ozempic when prescribed for diabetes and as Wegovy for weight loss. Novo Nordisk is one of two pharma companies that are currently selling branded GLP-1 treatments. U.S.-based Eli Lilly is the other one. Eli Lilly’s most advanced GLP-1 drugs are Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss. The active ingredient behind both these drugs is tirzepatide. The main difference between semaglutide and tirzepatide is that the latter mimics two gut hormones — not just one — GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). GLP-1 and GIP are chemicals that are known as incretin hormones. These hormones are secreted by the intestines after a person eats to regulate blood sugar levels. Drugs like semaglutide and tirzepatide increase the presence of GLP-1 and/or GIP in the human body to unnaturally high levels. Scientists aren’t sure how or why but at these spiked-up levels the hormones reduce a person’s appetite. In short, the primary reason GLP-1 drugs lead to weight loss is that people taking them eat less than they normally do. Different GLP-1 treatments have been found to work at varying speeds, according to clinical trials. The highest dose of Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy led to an average 15% of weight loss after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s Zepbound lost over 20% of their weight after 72 weeks. To summarize, GLP-1 drug users can expect to lose an average of 15% to 20% of their weight over the course of a year and four months. GLP-1 treatments are typically administered as weekly injections. Wegovy and Zepbound are both taken once-weekly via a subcutaneous injection, or under the skin. A month’s supply of both drugs comes with four single-dose, auto-injector pens — similar to EpiPens. Off-brand versions of these treatments are often sold in single or multi-dose vials. Additionally, Novo Nordisk sells a pill form of semaglutide, under the brand name Rybelsus, for treating type 2 diabetes. The retail price, without insurance, of Wegovy is $1,349.02 for a month’s supply. Zepbound’s list price for most of its doses is $1,059.87 a month. However, it’s important to note that these list prices don’t reflect what most customers pay after insurance and available manufacturer rebates are applied. Additionally, Eli Lilly started offering single-dose vials — instead of auto-injector pens — of its two lowest doses of Zepbound for $399 and $549 a month, respectively. This option must be paid out-of-pocket. A growing number of companies are now offering generic versions of these treatments, often priced hundreds of dollars lower than their branded counterparts. Insurance coverage for GLP-1 drugs for the use of weight loss varies by plan. Some insurance companies and employers have refused to cover the medication due to their high cost. A Morgan Stanley survey conducted earlier this year among GLP-1 drug users — including those using the treatments for diabetes — found that about two-thirds of respondents had their medication fully covered by insurance. Those paying out-of-pocket reported an average monthly cost of $196. Novo Nordisk claims that the majority of patients with insurance coverage pay $25 or less for a month’s supply of Ozempic or Wegovy. Additionally, Medicare started covering Wegovy this year for patients who are prescribed the medication as a way to reduce their risk of serious heart events such as heart attacks and strokes. Wegovy and Zepbound have the same side effects. Both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly caution that their weight loss drugs may cause serious side effects, including the potential risk of thyroid tumors. They advise that patients with a family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma, a type of thyroid cancer, or those with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2), should not use these medications. Other serious side effects include: However, the most common side effects are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, stomach pain, headache, and fatigue. Ozempic face is a non-medical term coined by cosmetic and celebrity dermatologist Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank, who observed the phenomenon among patients using weight-loss drugs. As these medications gained popularity, more patients began expressing concerns about changes in their facial appearance. Sudden weight loss can rapidly reduce facial fat, leading to changes such as skin shrinkage, sagging, and decreased elasticity. As the skin loses elastin and collagen, it becomes harder for it to retract after significant fat loss, resulting in pronounced signs of aging, loose or sagging skin, and a hollowed appearance. Probes from several health regulators, including the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and the European Medicines Agency, have all failed to find evidence that link GLP-1 drugs to suicide, suicidal thoughts, or actions. These investigations followed reports of individuals taking semaglutide and similar drugs exhibiting such behavior. While the FDA couldn’t rule out a “small risk,” it noted that a study funded by the NIH found patients on semaglutide had a lower risk of suicidal thoughts compared to those on other diabetes and anti-obesity medications. Georgios Schoretsanitis, lead author of a separate study, acknowledged no clear evidence of a causal relationship between semaglutide and suicidal ideation, but noted a potential association. His research, based on WHO data, found a 45% higher risk of reported suicidal thoughts in patients taking semaglutide. He cautioned that the results show an association, not proof of causation, and highlighted an increased risk in patients also on antidepressants. He advises clinicians to assess patients’ mental health before starting treatment. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have been testing their medications for uses outside of weight loss and diabetes. For example, earlier this year the FDA approved the use of Wegovy for reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular events for people who are overweight or obese. The change came just months after Novo Nordisk announced results from a clinical trial that found the drug cut the risk of serious heart events by 20%. For its part, Eli Lilly announced this year that tirzepatide was found to help alleviate sleep apnea in patients with obesity in late-stage clinical trials. Both companies are also testing their medications for the treatment of heart failure. Some studies have also found links between GLP-1s and a reduced risk of cancer, and alcohol and substance abuse. Both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have been struggling to produce enough GLP-1 drugs to meet rising demand. The FDA first declared a shortage of Wegovy in March of 2022. And the pharma company has been limiting starter doses of Wegovy since 2023 to ensure there’s enough supply for patients already on the drug. Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said this March that the gap between demand for weight loss drugs and the supply is significant enough to take years to close. Mounjaro was first added to the FDA’s drug shortage list in 2022, while Zepbound was officially declared in limited supply this April. All four drugs — Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound — still remain on the health regulator’s drug shortage, despite all but one dose of Wegovy being listed as currently available on the site. The FDA says that even when all doses of a drug are found to be available, there are other requirements that need to be fulfilled for a drug to be removed from the list, including whether backorders are being fulfilled. Both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are investing billions of dollars to ramp up production of these drugs. Novo Nordisk announced in February that it has acquired three facilities from the company’s largest shareholder, Novo Holdings, for $11 billion in an effort to address a shortage of Wegovy. The deal was made in connection with Novo Holdings’ acquisition of the drug manufacturing company Catalent (CTLT). Novo Nordisk said in a statement that the acquisition will increase the company’s production capacity beginning in 2026. Eli Lilly said in May that it will pile $5.3 billion into manufacturing its popular weight loss drugs, more than doubling its investment in a manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Indiana. The new spend brings the company’s total investment in the site to a whopping $9 billion, up from its original $3.7 billion commitment — making it now the largest manufacturing investment in the company’s history. Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the FDA to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brand name drugs like Wegovy has spurred several digital healthcare companies to take advantage of that provision. Companies like Hims & Hers, Sesame, and Noom all started selling compounded versions of GLP-1 drugs for hundreds of dollars cheaper than branded versions. However, there are risks. The compounded formulations are not FDA-approved, so the agency does not review the safety and efficacy of these products. Additionally, the FDA said in July that it had received reports of overdoses related to weight loss drugs, often due to confusion over proper dosing. Dozens of celebrities have come out and shared their experience with weight loss drugs. Late last year, Oprah Winfrey said she used prescription weight loss medications as a “maintenance tool.” Soon after the revelation, she left her seat from the board of WeightWatchers (WW). She had been a member of the board since 2015. In 2022, Elon Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns, that he had used Wegovy. Since then, Musk has become a big proponent of GLP-1 medications. Other celebrities who have said they used these drugs are: Kelly Clarkson, Amy Schumer, Whoopi Goldberg, Tracy Morgan, and Chelsea Handler. Several pharmaceutical companies are racing to introduce their own weight loss drugs to the market and disrupt the current duopoly held by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. These companies include Viking Therapeutics, which is developing both a weight loss injection and a pill. Larger pharma companies like Roche, Amgen (AMGN), and Pfizer are also working on their own anti-obesity drugs. To combat the growing competition, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are testing their drugs — as noted above — for other health benefits. They’re also testing newer and more powerful meds. Eli Lilly has nine obesity and diabetes drugs in development which could add even more health benefits to its portfolio of medications. These experimental treatments include a weight loss pill, orforglipron. The pill is currently in a phase 3 trial — its results will readout next year. Earlier trials found that it helped users lose an average of nearly 15% of weight after 36 weeks. Eli Lilly is also testing a strong GLP-1 injection, retatrutide, which in a clinical trial helped patients lose 17% of their weight in 24 weeks. Novo Nordisk is testing a weight loss pill of its own, amycretin. Novo Nordisk said that in a trial, patients that took a once-daily 50mg dose of amycretin lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months. Trial participants that took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months. The Danish pharma company is also developing a more potent obesity treatment called CagriSema. This new drug combines semaglutide with amylin and calcitonin receptor agonists. Amylin helps regulate blood sugar levels, similar to GLP-1, while calcitonin controls calcium levels in the blood. Results for two late-stage trials of the drug are expected this year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other the Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years. The US economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, and the stock market hit all-time highs in the third quarter, averting fears of a recession at hand. While the economy has remained resilient for the better part of the year, the US Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut surprised many analysts. Jamie Dimon believes the steep cut might be justified as geopolitical uncertainties can potentially disrupt the gains achieved by affecting supply chains and triggering uncertainties and fears in the market. READ ALSO: Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks and 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows. Powell and other Fed officials are open to further lowering interest rates after last month’s half-point cut, but there’s market debate on the pace. Soaring tensions in the Middle East with Israel invading Lebanon and threatening to attack Iran have triggered a layer of uncertainty, which Dimon believes could have a significant impact on the economy. Consequently, the banker believes that the 50 basis point cut could offer the much-needed economic support as inflation continues to drop. Nevertheless, James Demerit, Main Street Research CIO, believes the upward momentum in the equity markets will persist as the macro environment improves. While valuations appear to have gotten out of hand, there are still opportunities for stocks trading below their fair value as the investment environment improves. Apart from the magnificent seven stocks whose valuations have gotten out of hand, other stocks are trading at 16 times earnings, which, according to Demmert, is cheap considering the strong fundamentals that support a further rally. Companies that have consistently grown sales and profits should continue delivering regardless of the uncertainties around the US election and soaring geopolitical tensions. According to Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, it is time to be upbeat about the market heading into year-end. “The bull market has survived the year’s historically weakest quarter,” said Hill in an interview with CNBC. “It is likely to remain intact through at least the end of the year, as earnings remain strong, interest rates are moving lower and consumers are still spending.” When considering which stocks to buy, it’s beneficial to ask, “Which industries are experiencing the most rapid growth?” Despite some sectors facing challenges post-pandemic, many are flourishing, offering abundant opportunities. The global economy is rapidly evolving, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, travel, online retail, cybersecurity, and green energy experiencing significant growth. The AI market alone is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027 (according to estimates from Markets and Markets). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, total employment in the United States will expand by 11.9 million, or 7.7%, to 165.4 million from 153.5 million. Some of the top stocks that will make you rich in 5 to 10 years are companies that can rally as the global economy grows on the back of favorable monetary policies. Additionally, they include stocks of companies that are leaders in their respective fields and well-poised to benefit from technological changes such as artificial intelligence. In an interview with CNBC, Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head, reiterated utilities and large-cap real estate stocks are well positioned to perform heading into year end. Likewise, industrials and financials should receive a significant boost if the overall economy improves. According to Subramanian, the idea of the Fed cutting is not only liquidity inducing that should benefit the equity market but a move that ends up cutting money market yields. With liquidity slowly moving out of short-term bonds, most of it is ending up in equity markets as investors take note of high-risk reward opportunities at highly discounted valuations. Subramanian believes dividend stocks and growth stocks are well-positioned to generate significant value going forward. With this economic perspective in mind, let’s start our list of stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. Our Methodology To compile the list of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, we sifted through multiple reports and rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 possible stocks that experts and analysts believe have multi-year growth opportunities. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them, as of the end of Q2 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 130 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the top technology companies, having made a name for itself in developing and supplying semiconductor devices. While Nvidia is a leader in artificial intelligence graphics, Broadcom is making a mark on application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) The company is gaining traction in a growing market and currently produces the top ASICs used by businesses needing general-purpose AI chips, such as large tech companies like Meta and Alphabet. J.P. Morgan projects the addressable market for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s custom AI chips could reach $150 billion over the next four to five years, thanks to the company’s pioneering efforts in this field. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a major factor in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s business growth. More precisely, Broadcom stated in June that it was expected to sell over $11 billion worth of AI chips this year. The company’s AI-focused chip sales more than tripled to $3.1 billion in the second quarter. Not only is that incredible year-over-year growth, but Broadcom’s AI sales accounted for an impressive 24% of the company’s sales in the quarter, total revenue totalling $13.1 billion. During the earnings call, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) CEO Hock Tan stated that “customers continue to scale up and scale out their AI clusters” and that the demand for custom AI accelerators is still growing. As chip customers keep returning for more, the company should generate more revenue and earnings to return to shareholders. Here is what Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy said about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also performed well during the quarter, as the company reported better-than-expected earnings, with an upside from demand related to AI. This long-term holding is strongly positioned to benefit from continued AI demand, with AI sales in the quarter up 400% over the prior year. Overall, AI-related revenue accounted for 30% of total revenue in 2024 and is on pace to represent a majority of the company’s revenue within two to three years.” Overall AVGO ranks 4th on our list of 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 279 Amid the artificial intelligence race, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is arguably one of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, given the investments it’s made around the emerging technology. The company is also leveraging the technology to strengthen its cloud computing solution under Azure. Azure is the source of the largest AI opportunity from all this. With a current % market share of 25%, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second-largest provider of cloud computing services after Amazon, and its new AI tools are helping it grow even further. During the Q4 earnings call, the management reported that Azure now has 60,000 AI customers, which is approximately 60% more than it had during the same quarter last year. Given that Goldman Sachs projects that the cloud computing industry will generate $2 trillion in sales by 2030, Microsoft should be one of the beneficiaries, allowing it to generate more shareholder value. AI is already driving some of that growth, and Microsoft stands to gain as more businesses turn to its AI cloud services to improve their own AI offerings. Additionally, it has turned to technology to strengthen and enhance user experience on its office solutions, including Microsoft Office. Its investment of close to $13 billion in ChatGPT parent OpenAI has also had a hand in strengthening its search tool Bing sits to take on Google. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) regularly reports strong financial results; the most recent quarter was no exception. Its operating income and revenue grew by 15% annually, which is remarkable for a business of this size. Earnings per share (EPS) exceeded analysts’ estimates, landing at $2.95. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s ability to boost profitability while growing steadily is demonstrated by the growth of its earnings per share, affirming its ability to make shareholders rich. Over the previous five years, its outstanding share count has only dropped by about 3%, so a large portion of the growth can be linked to its improved earnings. Amid the earnings growth, Microsoft continues to reward investors with a 0.80% dividend yield even as it trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 31. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and their stakes amounted to $89.07 billion. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.” Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: OpenAI Is A Bad Business
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
OpenAI, a non-profit AI company that will lose anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion this year, will at some point in the next six or so months convert into a for-profit AI company, at which point it will continue to lose money in exactly the same way. Shortly after this news broke, Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati resigned, followed by Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew and VP of Research, Post Training Barret Zoph, leaving OpenAI with exactly three of its eleven cofounders remaining. This coincides suspiciously with OpenAI's increasingly-absurd fundraising efforts, where (as I predicted in late July) OpenAI has raised the largest venture-backed fundraise of all time $6.6 billion— at a valuation of $157 billion. Yet despite the high likelihood of the round's success, there are quite a few things to be worried about. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Apple is no longer in talks to join the round, and while one can only speculate about its reasoning, it's fair to assume that Apple (AAPL), on signing a non-disclosure agreement, was able to see exactly what OpenAI had (or had not) got behind the curtain, as well as its likely-grim financial picture, and decided to walk away. Nevertheless, both NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) are both investing, with Microsoft, according to the Wall Street Journal, pushing another $1 billion into the company — though it's unclear whether that's in real money or in "cloud credits" that allow OpenAI to continue using Microsoft's cloud. Yet arguably the most worrying sign is that SoftBank's Vision Fund will be investing $500 million in OpenAI. While it might seem a little weird to be worried about a half-billion dollar check, SoftBank — best-known for sinking $16 billion or more into WeWork and getting swindled by its founder, and dumping a further €900m into Wirecard, which turned out to be an outright fraud, with one founder now a fugitive from justice in Russia — is some of the dumbest money in the market, and a sign that any company taking it is likely a little desperate. While SoftBank has had a number of hits — NVIDIA, ARM and Alibaba, to name a few — it is famous for piling cash into terrible businesses, like Katerra (a construction company that died despite a $2 billion investment in 2021) and Zume Pizza (a robotic pizza company with a product that never worked that closed after raising more than $400 million, with $375 million coming from SoftBank). In any case, OpenAI will likely prevail and raise this round from a cadre of investors that will have to invest a minimum of $250 million to put money behind a company that has never turned a profit, that has no path to profitability, and has yet to create a truly meaningful product outside of Sam Altman's marketing expertise. This round is a farce — a group delusion, one borne of one man's uncanny ability to convince clueless idiots that he has some unique insight, despite the fact that all signs point to him knowing about as much as they do, allowing him to prop up an unsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company as a means of getting billions of dollars of equity in the company — and no, I don't care what he says to the contrary. Last week, the New York Times reported that OpenAI would lose $5 billion in 2024 (which The Information had estimated back in July), and that the company expected to raise the price of ChatGPT's premium product to $44-a-month over the next five years, and intended to increase the price of ChatGPT to $22-a-month by the end of 2024, a pale horse I've warned you of in the past. Interestingly (and worryingly), the article also confirms another hypothesis of mine — that "fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products" - in simpler terms, that OpenAI will likely raise $6.5 billion in funding, and then have to do so again in short order, likely in perpetuity. The Times also reports that OpenAI is making estimates that I would describe as "fucking ridiculous." OpenAI's monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, and the company expects to make $3.7 billion in revenue this year (the company will, as mentioned, lose $5 billion anyway), yet the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it's not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1. OpenAI loses money every single time that somebody uses their product, and while it might make money selling premium subscriptions, I severely doubt it’s turning a profit on these customers, and certainly losing money on any and all power users. As I've said before, I believe there's also a subprime AI crisis brewing because OpenAI's API services — which lets people integrate its various models into external products — is currently priced at a loss, and increasing prices will likely make this product unsustainable for many businesses currently relying on these discounted rates. As I've said before, OpenAI is unprofitable, unsustainable and untenable in its current form, but I think it's important to explain exactly how untenable it is, and I'm going to start with a few statements: And, fundamentally, I can find no compelling evidence that suggests that OpenAI will be able to sustain this growth. In fact, I can find no historical comparison, and believe that OpenAI's growth is already stumbling. Let's take a look, shall we? To do this right, we have to lay out exactly how OpenAI makes money. According to the New York Times, OpenAI expects ChatGPT to make about $2.7 billion in revenue in 2024, with an additional $1 billion coming from "other businesses using its technology." Let's break this down. As a result of these numbers, I have major concerns about the viability of OpenAI's business, and the generative AI market at large. If OpenAI — the most prominent name in all of generative AI — is only making a billion dollars a year from this, what does that say about the larger growth trajectory of this company, or actual usage of generative AI products? I'll get to that in a bit. First, we've gotta talk about the dollars. So, as it stands, OpenAI makes the majority — more than 70% — of its revenue from selling premium access to ChatGPT. A few weeks ago, The Information reported that ChatGPT Plus had "more than 10 million paying subscribers," and that it had 1 million more that were paying for "higher-priced plans for business teams." As I've laid out above, this means that OpenAI is making about $200 million a month from consumer subscribers, but "business teams" is an indeterminate split between teams ($25-a-user-a-month paid annually) and enterprise (at least $60-a-user-a-month, paid annually, with a minimum of 150 seats). One important detail: 100,000 of the 1 million business customers are workers at management consultancy PwC, which has also become OpenAI's "first partner for selling enterprise offerings to other businesses." It isn't clear whether these are enterprise accounts or teams accounts, or whether PwC is paying full price (I'd wager it isn’t). Here’s how this would play out in revenue terms across several assumed divisions of the customer base, and an assumption that every Teams customer is paying $27.5 (that plan costs either $25 or $30, depending on whether you pay monthly or yearly, but for the sake of fairness, I went with the middle ground). From there, we can run some hypothetical monthly revenue numbers based on a million "higher-priced plans for business teams." Sadly, I don't think things are that good, and I honestly don't think these would be particularly-impressive numbers to begin with. We can actually make a more-precise estimate by working backwards from the New York Times' estimates. ChatGPT Plus has 10 million customers, making OpenAI around $2.4 billion dollars a year (ten million users spending $20 each month equates to $200 million. Multiply that by 12, you get $2.4 billion). This means that business users make up about $300 million a year in revenue, or $25 million a month. That is, to be frank, extremely bad. These are estimates, but even if they were doubled, these would not be particularly exciting numbers. For all the excitement about OpenAI's revenue — putting aside the fact that it spends $2.35 to make $1 — the majority of the money it makes is from subscriptions to ChatGPT Plus for consumers, though one can fairly say there are professionals that use it under the consumer version too. While 10 million paying subscribers might seem like a lot, "ChatGPT" is effectively to generative AI what "Google" is to search. Ten million people paying for this is table stakes. OpenAI has been covered by effectively every single media outlet, is mentioned in almost every single conversation about AI (even when it's not about generative AI!), and has the backing and marketing push of Microsoft and the entirety of Silicon Valley behind it. ChatGPT has over 200 million weekly users, and the New York Times reports that OpenAI has "350 million people use [OpenAI's] services each month as of June" (though it's unclear if that includes those using the API). Collectively, this means that OpenAI — the most popular company in the industry — can only convert about 3% of its users. This might be because it's not obvious why anyone should pay for a premium subscription. Paying for ChatGPT Plus doesn't dramatically change the product, nor does it offer a particularly-compelling new use case for anyone other than power users. As a company, OpenAI is flat-out terrible at product. While it may be able to attract hundreds of millions of people to dick around with ChatGPT (losing money with every prompt), it's hard to convert them because you have to, on some level, show the user what ChatGPT can do to get them to pay for it… and there isn't really much you can charge for, other than limiting how many times they can use it. And, if we're honest, it still isn't obvious why anyone should use ChatGPT in the first place, other than the fact everybody is talking about it. You can ask it to generate something — a picture, a few paragraphs, perhaps a question — and at that point say "cool" and move on. I can absolutely see how there are people who regularly use ChatGPT's natural language prompts to answer questions that they can't quite phrase (a word that's on the tip of their tongue, a question they're not sure how to phrase, or to brainstorm something) but beyond that, there really is no "sticky" part of this product beyond "a search engine that talks back to you." That product is extremely commoditized. The free version of ChatGPT is effectively identical to the free version of Anthropic's Claude, Meta's AI assistant, Microsoft's Copilot, and even Twitter's "Grok." They all use similar training data, all give similar outputs, and are all free. Why would you pay for ChatGPT Plus when Meta or Microsoft will give you their own spin on the same flavor? Other than pure brand recognition, what is it that ChatGPT does that Copilot (powered by ChatGPT) doesn't? And does that matter to the average user? I'd argue it doesn't. I'd also argue that those willing to pay for a "Plus" subscription are more likely to use the platform way, way more than free users, which in turn may (as one Redditor hypothesized regarding Anthropic's "Claude Pro" subscription) lose it the revenue on said premium subscriber. While there's a chance that OpenAI could have a chunk of users that aren't particularly active, one cannot run a business based on selling stuff you hope that people won't use. I’ll touch on customer churn later, but one more note about ChatGPT Plus users: as with any other consumer-centric subscription product, these customers are far more likely to cut their spending when they no longer feel like they’re getting value from their product, or when their household budgets demand it. Netflix — the biggest name in streaming — lost a million customers in 2022, around the time of the cost-of-living crisis (and, from 2025, it plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers altogether) ChatGPT Plus is likely, for many people, a “lifestyle product.” And the problem is that, when people lose their jobs or inflation hikes, these products are the first to get slashed from the household budget. OpenAI also has a unique problem that makes it entirely different to most SaaS solutions — the cost of delivering the solution. While 3% conversion of free customers to paying customers might regularly be on the low side of "good," said solutions are nowhere near as expensive as running software using generative AI. There's also another wrinkle. If the majority of OpenAI's revenue — over 70% — comes from people paying for ChatGPT Plus, then that heavily suggests the majority of its compute costs come from what is arguably its least-profitable product. The only alternative is that OpenAI's compute costs are so high that, despite making two-thirds of its revenue, ChatGPT creates so much overhead that it sours the rest of the business. You see, ChatGPT Plus is not a great business. It's remarkable that OpenAI found 10 million people to pay for it, but how do you grow that to 20 million, or 40 million? These aren't idle questions, either. At present, OpenAI makes $225 million a month — $2.7 billion a year — by selling premium subscriptions to ChatGPT. To hit a revenue target of $11.6 billion in 2025, OpenAI would need to increase revenue from ChatGPT customers by 310%. If we consider the current ratio of Plus subscriptions to Teams and Enterprise subscriptions — about 88.89% to 11.11% — OpenAI would need to find 18.29 million paying users (assuming a price increase of $2 a month), while also retaining every single one of its current ChatGPT Plus users at a new price point, for a total $7.4 billion, or $616 million or so a month. It would also have to make $933 million in revenue from its business or enterprise clients, which, again, would require OpenAI to more-than-triple their current users. OpenAI's primary revenue source is one of the most easily-commoditized things in the world — a Large Language Model in a web browser — and its competitor is Mark Zuckerberg, a petty king with a huge warchest that can never, ever be fired, even with significant investor pressure. Even if that wasn't the case, the premium product that OpenAI sells is far from endearing, still looking for a killer app a year-and-a-half into its existence, with its biggest competitor being the free version of ChatGPT. There are ways that OpenAI could potentially turn this around, but even a battalion of experienced salespeople will still need paying, and will have the immediate job of "increase revenue by 300%" for a product that most people have trouble explaining. No, really. What is ChatGPT? Can you give me an answer that actually explains what the product does? What is the compelling use case that makes this a must-have? I am hammering this point because this is the majority of OpenAI's revenue. OpenAI lives and dies on the revenue gained from ChatGPT, a product that hasn't meaningfully changed since it launched beyond adding new models that do, for most users, exactly the same thing. While some might find ChatGPT's voice mode interesting, "interesting" just isn't good enough today. And to drill down further, the majority of OpenAI's revenue is from ChatGPT Plus, not its Enterprise or Teams product, meaning that hiring a sales team is far from practical. How do you sell this to consumers, or professionals? Even Microsoft, which has a vast marketing apparatus and deep pockets, struggled to sell Copilot — which is based on OpenAI’s GPT models — on its weird (and presumably expensive) Superbowl ads, or on the countless commercials that dotted the 2024 Olympic Games. To triple users, ChatGPT must meaningfully change, and do so immediately, or disclose multiple meaningful, powerful use cases that are so impressive that 18 million new people agree to pay $22 a month. That is an incredible — and some might say insane — goal, and one that I do not think this company is capable of achieving. Yet this is far from the most worrying part of the current OpenAI story. What's astounded me about this whole story is how little of OpenAI's revenue comes from providing other companies the means to integrate generative AI into their systems, for two big reasons: In the event that OpenAI and Microsoft are each making about a billion dollars in annualized revenue — again, these are estimates based on current growth trajectories — it heavily suggests that there is...two billion dollars of revenue? For Microsoft and OpenAI combined? That's god damn pathetic! That's really, really bad! And the fact these "annualized" figures have changed so little since June means that growth has slowed, because otherwise said numbers would have increased (as "annualized" is based on projections). Let me explain my reasoning a bit. “Annualized” revenue is a somewhat-vague term that can mean many things, but taking The Information’s definition from mid-June (when annualized revenue was $3.4 billion), annualized revenue is “a measure of the past month’s revenue multiplied by 12.” That suggests that OpenAI’s revenue in that month was $283 million, a number which the New York Times updated in their piece, saying that OpenAI made $300 million of revenue in the month of August, which works out to $3.6 billion in annualized revenue, and OpenAI expects to hit $3.7 billion this year, which works out to $308 million. Just so we’re abundantly clear — this means that OpenAI, unquestionably the leader and most-prominent brand and the first thought anybody will have when integrating generative AI, is only making about $80 million a month selling access to its models? This heavily-suggests that generative AI, as a technology, doesn’t necessarily have a product-market fit. According to a survey by Andreessen Horowitz earlier in the year, “the 2023 market share of closed-source models [was estimated at] 80 to 90%, with the majority of share going to OpenAI.” Another survey from IOT Analytics published late last year suggests that number might look a little bit different, with 39% of the market share going to OpenAI and 30% going to Microsoft. Assuming that the latter numbers are true, this suggests that the generative AI market is incredibly small. If OpenAI — which dominates with, I’d wager, at least a 30% market share — is only making $1 billion a year from selling access to its models, and at this stage in the massively-inflated hype bubble, there may not even be $10 billion of annual revenue from companies integrating generative AI into their products. And let’s be honest, this is where all of the money should be. If this stuff is the future of everything, why is the revenue stream so painfully weak? Why isn’t generative AI in everything — not just big apps and services hoping to ride a wave as it crests, oblivious to the imminent collapse — but all apps, and present in a big way, where it’s core to the app’s functionality? OpenAI making so little selling access to their models suggests that, despite the hype-cycle, there either isn’t the interest in integrating these products from developers, or these integrations aren’t that useful, attractive or impressive to users. Again, these products are charged on usage — and so, it’s possible for generative AI to be integrated into a service, but not actually drive much revenue for OpenAI. While ChatGPT has brand recognition, companies integrating OpenAI’s models in their products are far more indicative of the long-term health of both the company and the industry itself, because if OpenAI can’t convince people to integrate and use this shit, do you really think other companies are succeeding? There are two counterarguments: While I can’t say for certain, and I’ll happily admit if I’m wrong in the future, the numbers here suggest that OpenAI’s cloud services business — as in integrating its supposedly industry-leading technology into other products — is nowhere near as viable a business as selling subscriptions to ChatGPT, which in turn suggests that there is either a lack of interest in integrating generative AI, a lack of adoption once said integration has happened, or a lack of usage by users of features powered by generative AI itself. The only other avenue is that OpenAI isn’t charging what it believes these services are worth. As discussed earlier in the piece, OpenAI needs to more-than-triple revenue in the next 15 months to hit $11.6 billion in sales. Furthermore, at its current burn rate, OpenAI is currently spending $2.35 to make $1 — meaning that $11.6 billion in revenue will cost $27 billion to make. While costs could foreseeably come down, all signs point to them increasing. As noted above, GPT-4 cost $100 million to train, and more complex future models will cost hundreds of millions or even a billion dollars to train. The Information also estimated back in July that OpenAI's training costs would balloon to $3 billion in 2024, and it’s fair to assume that models like o1 and GPT-5 (also known as “Orion”) will be significantly more expensive to train. OpenAI also has a popularity problem. While it’s usually great news that a product has 300 million free users, every single time somebody uses the service costs OpenAI money, and lots of it. The Information estimated OpenAI will spend around $4 billion on server costs in 2024 to run ChatGPT and host other companies running services using GPT and its other models, effectively meaning that every dollar of revenue is immediately eaten by the costs of acquiring it. And that’s before you factor in paying the more-than 1,500 people that work at the company (another $1.5 billion in costs alone, and OpenAI expects to hire another 200 by the end of the year), and other costs like real estate and taxes. As a result, I am now updating my hypothesis. I believe that OpenAI, once it has raised its current ($6.5 billion to $7 billion) round, will have to raise another round of at least the same size by July 2025, if not sooner. To quote the New York Times’ reporting, “fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products.” OpenAI could potentially reduce costs, but has shown little proof that it’s able to, and its one attempt (the more efficient “Arrakis” model) failed to launch. One would also imagine that this company — now burning $5 billion a year — is doing all it can to try and bring costs down, and even if it isn’t, I severely doubt that it’s possible to. After all, Anthropic is facing exactly the same problem, and is on course to lose $2.7 billion in 2024 on $800 million in revenue, which makes me think the likelihood of this being a quick fix is extremely low. There is, however, another problem, one caused by their current fundraise. OpenAI is, at present, raising $6.5 to $7 billion in capital at a $150 billion valuation. Assuming it completes this raise — which is likely to happen — it will mean that all future rounds have to be at either $150 billion or higher. A lower valuation (called a down-round) would both upset current investors and send a loud signal to the market that the company is having trouble, which overwhelmingly suggests that OpenAI’s only way to survive is to raise its next round at a valuation of $200 billion, and require yet another giant raise, likely of at least $10 billion. For context, the biggest IPO valuation in US corporate history was Alibaba, which debuted onto the New York Stock Exchange with a market cap of nearly $170bn. That figure is more than double the runner-up, Facebook, which had a value of $81bn. Are you telling me that OpenAI — a company that burns vast piles of money like the Joker in The Dark Knight, and has no obvious path to profitability, and a dubious addressable market — is worth more than Alibaba, which, even a decade ago, was a giant of a company? Further souring the terms are its prior commitments to Microsoft, which owns 75% of all future profits (ha!) until it recoups its $13 billion investment, after which point it receives 49% of all profits until it is paid $1.56 trillion dollars, or 120 times the original amount, though the move to a non-profit structure may remove the limits on OpenAI’s ridiculous “profit participation units” where previous investors are given a slice of (theoretical) profits from the least profitable company in the world. Nevertheless, Microsoft’s iron grip on the future profits of this company — as well as complete access to its research and technology — means that anyone investing is effectively agreeing to help Microsoft out, and makes any stock (or PPUs) that Microsoft owns far more valuable. There’s also the other problem: how OpenAI converts its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit, and whether that’s actually possible. Investors are, according to the New York Times, hedging their bets. OpenAI has two years from the deal’s close to convert to a for-profit company, or its funding will convert into debt at a 9% interest rate. As a result, OpenAI now faces multiple challenges: Also, at some point, OpenAI will have to work out a way to go public, because otherwise there is absolutely no reason to invest in this company, unless you are doing so with the belief that you will be able to offload your shares in a future secondary sale. At that point, OpenAI resembles a kind of investment scam where new investors exist only to help old investors liquidate their assets rather than anyone investing in the actual value of the company itself. And, after that, OpenAI will still need to raise more rounds of funding. ChatGPT’s free version is a poison in its system, a marketing channel that burns billions of dollars to introduce people to a product that only ten million people will actually pay for, and its future depends largely on its ability to continue convincing people to use it. And in a few months, OpenAI’s integration with Apple devices launches, meaning that millions of people will now start using ChatGPT for free on their iPhones, with OpenAI footing the bill in the hopes they’ll upgrade to ChatGPT Plus, at which point Apple will take $6 of the $20 a month subscription. How does this continue? How does OpenAI survive? I realize I’ve been a little repetitive in this piece, but it’s really important to focus on the fact that the leader in the generative AI space does not appear to make that much money (less than 30% of its revenue) helping people put generative AI in their products, and makes most of their money selling subscriptions to a product that mostly coasts on hype. While it may seem impressive that OpenAI has 10 million paying subscribers, that’s the result of literally every AI story mentioning its name in almost every media outlet, and its name being on the lips of basically everybody in the entirety of the tech industry — and a chunk of the business world at large. Worse still, arguably the most important product that OpenAI sells is access to its models, and it’s the least-viable part of its business, despite “GPT” being synonymous with the concept of integrating generative AI into your company. Because access to its APIs isn’t a particularly big business, OpenAI’s hopes of hitting its revenue goals is almost entirely contingent on ChatGPT Plus continuing to grow. While this might happen in the short term (though research suggests that 11% of customers stop paying after a month and 26% after three months), ChatGPT Plus has no real moat, little product differentiation (outside of its advanced voice mode, which Meta is already working on a competitor to), and increasing commoditization from other models, open source platforms, and even on-device models (like on Copilot+-powered PCs). The features that ChatGPT is best known for — generating code, summarizing meetings, brainstorming and generating stuff — can be done on any number of other platforms, in many cases for free, and OpenAI’s biggest competitor to ChatGPT Plus is ChatGPT itself. And I cannot express enough how bad a sign it is that its cloud business is so thin. The largest player in the supposedly most important industry ever can only scrounge together $1 billion in annual revenue selling access to the most well-known model in the industry. This suggests a fundamental weakness in the revenue model behind GPT, as well as a fundamental weakness in the generative artificial intelligence market writ large. If OpenAI cannot make more than a billion dollars of revenue off of this, then it’s fair to assume that there is either a lack of interest from developers or a lack of interest from the consumers those developers are serving. Remember when I said that OpenAI mentioned in its recent Devay that it had “cut costs for developers to access [their] API by 99% in the last two years” (which Max Zeff of TechCrunch posits may be due to price pressure from Google and Meta)? That suggests that OpenAI really has no room to start charging more for access to its APIs. This technology is commoditized, with few points of differentiation. It can’t, for example, raise prices for the sake of a better, more capable product. OpenAI is trapped. All of this is happening at a time when an astronomical amount of talent is leaving the company — the talent that OpenAI desperately needs to build products that people will actually pay for. At this point, it’s hard to see how OpenAI survives. To continue growing ChatGPT Plus, it will have to create meaningful, mass-market use cases, or hope it can coast on a relatively-specious hype wave, one that will have to be so powerful it effectively triples its users. Even then, OpenAI will have to both find ways to give developers more reasons to integrate its models while making sure that said models provide a service that the end-user will actually appreciate, which is heavily-reliant on both the underlying technology and the ability of developers to create meaningful products with it. And OpenAI is getting desperate. According to Fortune, OpenAI’s culture is deeply brittle, with a “relentless pressure to introduce products” rushing its o1 model to market as Sam Altman was “eager to prove to potential investors in the company’s latest funding round that OpenAI remains at the forefront of AI development” despite staff saying it wasn’t ready. These aren’t the actions of a company that’s on the forefront of anything — they’re desperate moves made by desperate people burning the candle at both ends. Yet, once you get past these problems, you run head-first into the largest one: that generative AI is deeply unprofitable to run. When every subscriber or API call loses you money, growth only exists to help flog your company to investors, and at some point investors will begin to question whether this company can stand on its own two feet. It can’t. OpenAI is a disaster in the making, and behind it sits a potentially bigger, nastier disaster — a lack of any real strength in the generative AI market. If OpenAI can only make a billion dollars as the leader in this market (with $200 million of that coming from Microsoft reselling its models), it heavily suggests that there is neither developer nor user interest in generative AI products. Perhaps it’s the hallucination problem, or perhaps it’s just that generative AI isn’t something that produces particularly-interesting interactions with a user. While you could argue that “somebody can work out a really cool product,” it’s time to ask why Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI, Apple, and Microsoft have failed to make one in the last two years. Though ChatGPT Plus is popular, it’s clear that it operates — much like ChatGPT — as a way of seeing what generative AI can do rather than a product that customers love. I see no viable way for OpenAI to grow this product at the rate it needs to be grown, and that’s before considering its total lack of profit. I hypothesize that OpenAI will successfully close its $150 billion round in the next few weeks, but that growth is already slowing, and will slow dramatically as we enter the new year. I believe the upcoming earnings from Microsoft and Google will further dampen excitement around generative AI, which in turn will reduce the likelihood that developers will integrate GPT further into their products, while also likely depressing market interest in ChatGPT writ large. While this bubble can continue coasting for a while, nothing about the OpenAI story looks good. This is a company lost, bleeding money with every interaction with the customer, flogging software that’s at best kind-of useful and at worst actively harmful. Unless something significantly changes — like a breakthrough in energy or compute efficiency — I can’t see how this company makes it another two years. Worse still, If my hypothesis about the wider generative AI market is true, then there might simply not be a viable business in providing these services. While Meta and OpenAI might be able to claim hundreds of millions of people use these services, I see no evidence that these are products that millions of people will pay for long-term. For me to be wrong, these companies will have to solve multiple intractable problems, come up with entirely-new use cases, and raise historic amounts of capital. If I’m right, we’re watching venture capitalists and companies like Microsoft burn tens of billions of dollars to power the next generation of products that nobody gives a shit about.

Title: OpenAI Is A Bad Business

Time Published: 2024-10-09T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
OpenAI, a non-profit AI company that will lose anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion this year, will at some point in the next six or so months convert into a for-profit AI company, at which point it will continue to lose money in exactly the same way. Shortly after this news broke, Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati resigned, followed by Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew and VP of Research, Post Training Barret Zoph, leaving OpenAI with exactly three of its eleven cofounders remaining. This coincides suspiciously with OpenAI's increasingly-absurd fundraising efforts, where (as I predicted in late July) OpenAI has raised the largest venture-backed fundraise of all time $6.6 billion— at a valuation of $157 billion. Yet despite the high likelihood of the round's success, there are quite a few things to be worried about. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Apple is no longer in talks to join the round, and while one can only speculate about its reasoning, it's fair to assume that Apple (AAPL), on signing a non-disclosure agreement, was able to see exactly what OpenAI had (or had not) got behind the curtain, as well as its likely-grim financial picture, and decided to walk away. Nevertheless, both NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) are both investing, with Microsoft, according to the Wall Street Journal, pushing another $1 billion into the company — though it's unclear whether that's in real money or in "cloud credits" that allow OpenAI to continue using Microsoft's cloud. Yet arguably the most worrying sign is that SoftBank's Vision Fund will be investing $500 million in OpenAI. While it might seem a little weird to be worried about a half-billion dollar check, SoftBank — best-known for sinking $16 billion or more into WeWork and getting swindled by its founder, and dumping a further €900m into Wirecard, which turned out to be an outright fraud, with one founder now a fugitive from justice in Russia — is some of the dumbest money in the market, and a sign that any company taking it is likely a little desperate. While SoftBank has had a number of hits — NVIDIA, ARM and Alibaba, to name a few — it is famous for piling cash into terrible businesses, like Katerra (a construction company that died despite a $2 billion investment in 2021) and Zume Pizza (a robotic pizza company with a product that never worked that closed after raising more than $400 million, with $375 million coming from SoftBank). In any case, OpenAI will likely prevail and raise this round from a cadre of investors that will have to invest a minimum of $250 million to put money behind a company that has never turned a profit, that has no path to profitability, and has yet to create a truly meaningful product outside of Sam Altman's marketing expertise. This round is a farce — a group delusion, one borne of one man's uncanny ability to convince clueless idiots that he has some unique insight, despite the fact that all signs point to him knowing about as much as they do, allowing him to prop up an unsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company as a means of getting billions of dollars of equity in the company — and no, I don't care what he says to the contrary. Last week, the New York Times reported that OpenAI would lose $5 billion in 2024 (which The Information had estimated back in July), and that the company expected to raise the price of ChatGPT's premium product to $44-a-month over the next five years, and intended to increase the price of ChatGPT to $22-a-month by the end of 2024, a pale horse I've warned you of in the past. Interestingly (and worryingly), the article also confirms another hypothesis of mine — that "fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products" - in simpler terms, that OpenAI will likely raise $6.5 billion in funding, and then have to do so again in short order, likely in perpetuity. The Times also reports that OpenAI is making estimates that I would describe as "fucking ridiculous." OpenAI's monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, and the company expects to make $3.7 billion in revenue this year (the company will, as mentioned, lose $5 billion anyway), yet the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it's not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1. OpenAI loses money every single time that somebody uses their product, and while it might make money selling premium subscriptions, I severely doubt it’s turning a profit on these customers, and certainly losing money on any and all power users. As I've said before, I believe there's also a subprime AI crisis brewing because OpenAI's API services — which lets people integrate its various models into external products — is currently priced at a loss, and increasing prices will likely make this product unsustainable for many businesses currently relying on these discounted rates. As I've said before, OpenAI is unprofitable, unsustainable and untenable in its current form, but I think it's important to explain exactly how untenable it is, and I'm going to start with a few statements: And, fundamentally, I can find no compelling evidence that suggests that OpenAI will be able to sustain this growth. In fact, I can find no historical comparison, and believe that OpenAI's growth is already stumbling. Let's take a look, shall we? To do this right, we have to lay out exactly how OpenAI makes money. According to the New York Times, OpenAI expects ChatGPT to make about $2.7 billion in revenue in 2024, with an additional $1 billion coming from "other businesses using its technology." Let's break this down. As a result of these numbers, I have major concerns about the viability of OpenAI's business, and the generative AI market at large. If OpenAI — the most prominent name in all of generative AI — is only making a billion dollars a year from this, what does that say about the larger growth trajectory of this company, or actual usage of generative AI products? I'll get to that in a bit. First, we've gotta talk about the dollars. So, as it stands, OpenAI makes the majority — more than 70% — of its revenue from selling premium access to ChatGPT. A few weeks ago, The Information reported that ChatGPT Plus had "more than 10 million paying subscribers," and that it had 1 million more that were paying for "higher-priced plans for business teams." As I've laid out above, this means that OpenAI is making about $200 million a month from consumer subscribers, but "business teams" is an indeterminate split between teams ($25-a-user-a-month paid annually) and enterprise (at least $60-a-user-a-month, paid annually, with a minimum of 150 seats). One important detail: 100,000 of the 1 million business customers are workers at management consultancy PwC, which has also become OpenAI's "first partner for selling enterprise offerings to other businesses." It isn't clear whether these are enterprise accounts or teams accounts, or whether PwC is paying full price (I'd wager it isn’t). Here’s how this would play out in revenue terms across several assumed divisions of the customer base, and an assumption that every Teams customer is paying $27.5 (that plan costs either $25 or $30, depending on whether you pay monthly or yearly, but for the sake of fairness, I went with the middle ground). From there, we can run some hypothetical monthly revenue numbers based on a million "higher-priced plans for business teams." Sadly, I don't think things are that good, and I honestly don't think these would be particularly-impressive numbers to begin with. We can actually make a more-precise estimate by working backwards from the New York Times' estimates. ChatGPT Plus has 10 million customers, making OpenAI around $2.4 billion dollars a year (ten million users spending $20 each month equates to $200 million. Multiply that by 12, you get $2.4 billion). This means that business users make up about $300 million a year in revenue, or $25 million a month. That is, to be frank, extremely bad. These are estimates, but even if they were doubled, these would not be particularly exciting numbers. For all the excitement about OpenAI's revenue — putting aside the fact that it spends $2.35 to make $1 — the majority of the money it makes is from subscriptions to ChatGPT Plus for consumers, though one can fairly say there are professionals that use it under the consumer version too. While 10 million paying subscribers might seem like a lot, "ChatGPT" is effectively to generative AI what "Google" is to search. Ten million people paying for this is table stakes. OpenAI has been covered by effectively every single media outlet, is mentioned in almost every single conversation about AI (even when it's not about generative AI!), and has the backing and marketing push of Microsoft and the entirety of Silicon Valley behind it. ChatGPT has over 200 million weekly users, and the New York Times reports that OpenAI has "350 million people use [OpenAI's] services each month as of June" (though it's unclear if that includes those using the API). Collectively, this means that OpenAI — the most popular company in the industry — can only convert about 3% of its users. This might be because it's not obvious why anyone should pay for a premium subscription. Paying for ChatGPT Plus doesn't dramatically change the product, nor does it offer a particularly-compelling new use case for anyone other than power users. As a company, OpenAI is flat-out terrible at product. While it may be able to attract hundreds of millions of people to dick around with ChatGPT (losing money with every prompt), it's hard to convert them because you have to, on some level, show the user what ChatGPT can do to get them to pay for it… and there isn't really much you can charge for, other than limiting how many times they can use it. And, if we're honest, it still isn't obvious why anyone should use ChatGPT in the first place, other than the fact everybody is talking about it. You can ask it to generate something — a picture, a few paragraphs, perhaps a question — and at that point say "cool" and move on. I can absolutely see how there are people who regularly use ChatGPT's natural language prompts to answer questions that they can't quite phrase (a word that's on the tip of their tongue, a question they're not sure how to phrase, or to brainstorm something) but beyond that, there really is no "sticky" part of this product beyond "a search engine that talks back to you." That product is extremely commoditized. The free version of ChatGPT is effectively identical to the free version of Anthropic's Claude, Meta's AI assistant, Microsoft's Copilot, and even Twitter's "Grok." They all use similar training data, all give similar outputs, and are all free. Why would you pay for ChatGPT Plus when Meta or Microsoft will give you their own spin on the same flavor? Other than pure brand recognition, what is it that ChatGPT does that Copilot (powered by ChatGPT) doesn't? And does that matter to the average user? I'd argue it doesn't. I'd also argue that those willing to pay for a "Plus" subscription are more likely to use the platform way, way more than free users, which in turn may (as one Redditor hypothesized regarding Anthropic's "Claude Pro" subscription) lose it the revenue on said premium subscriber. While there's a chance that OpenAI could have a chunk of users that aren't particularly active, one cannot run a business based on selling stuff you hope that people won't use. I’ll touch on customer churn later, but one more note about ChatGPT Plus users: as with any other consumer-centric subscription product, these customers are far more likely to cut their spending when they no longer feel like they’re getting value from their product, or when their household budgets demand it. Netflix — the biggest name in streaming — lost a million customers in 2022, around the time of the cost-of-living crisis (and, from 2025, it plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers altogether) ChatGPT Plus is likely, for many people, a “lifestyle product.” And the problem is that, when people lose their jobs or inflation hikes, these products are the first to get slashed from the household budget. OpenAI also has a unique problem that makes it entirely different to most SaaS solutions — the cost of delivering the solution. While 3% conversion of free customers to paying customers might regularly be on the low side of "good," said solutions are nowhere near as expensive as running software using generative AI. There's also another wrinkle. If the majority of OpenAI's revenue — over 70% — comes from people paying for ChatGPT Plus, then that heavily suggests the majority of its compute costs come from what is arguably its least-profitable product. The only alternative is that OpenAI's compute costs are so high that, despite making two-thirds of its revenue, ChatGPT creates so much overhead that it sours the rest of the business. You see, ChatGPT Plus is not a great business. It's remarkable that OpenAI found 10 million people to pay for it, but how do you grow that to 20 million, or 40 million? These aren't idle questions, either. At present, OpenAI makes $225 million a month — $2.7 billion a year — by selling premium subscriptions to ChatGPT. To hit a revenue target of $11.6 billion in 2025, OpenAI would need to increase revenue from ChatGPT customers by 310%. If we consider the current ratio of Plus subscriptions to Teams and Enterprise subscriptions — about 88.89% to 11.11% — OpenAI would need to find 18.29 million paying users (assuming a price increase of $2 a month), while also retaining every single one of its current ChatGPT Plus users at a new price point, for a total $7.4 billion, or $616 million or so a month. It would also have to make $933 million in revenue from its business or enterprise clients, which, again, would require OpenAI to more-than-triple their current users. OpenAI's primary revenue source is one of the most easily-commoditized things in the world — a Large Language Model in a web browser — and its competitor is Mark Zuckerberg, a petty king with a huge warchest that can never, ever be fired, even with significant investor pressure. Even if that wasn't the case, the premium product that OpenAI sells is far from endearing, still looking for a killer app a year-and-a-half into its existence, with its biggest competitor being the free version of ChatGPT. There are ways that OpenAI could potentially turn this around, but even a battalion of experienced salespeople will still need paying, and will have the immediate job of "increase revenue by 300%" for a product that most people have trouble explaining. No, really. What is ChatGPT? Can you give me an answer that actually explains what the product does? What is the compelling use case that makes this a must-have? I am hammering this point because this is the majority of OpenAI's revenue. OpenAI lives and dies on the revenue gained from ChatGPT, a product that hasn't meaningfully changed since it launched beyond adding new models that do, for most users, exactly the same thing. While some might find ChatGPT's voice mode interesting, "interesting" just isn't good enough today. And to drill down further, the majority of OpenAI's revenue is from ChatGPT Plus, not its Enterprise or Teams product, meaning that hiring a sales team is far from practical. How do you sell this to consumers, or professionals? Even Microsoft, which has a vast marketing apparatus and deep pockets, struggled to sell Copilot — which is based on OpenAI’s GPT models — on its weird (and presumably expensive) Superbowl ads, or on the countless commercials that dotted the 2024 Olympic Games. To triple users, ChatGPT must meaningfully change, and do so immediately, or disclose multiple meaningful, powerful use cases that are so impressive that 18 million new people agree to pay $22 a month. That is an incredible — and some might say insane — goal, and one that I do not think this company is capable of achieving. Yet this is far from the most worrying part of the current OpenAI story. What's astounded me about this whole story is how little of OpenAI's revenue comes from providing other companies the means to integrate generative AI into their systems, for two big reasons: In the event that OpenAI and Microsoft are each making about a billion dollars in annualized revenue — again, these are estimates based on current growth trajectories — it heavily suggests that there is...two billion dollars of revenue? For Microsoft and OpenAI combined? That's god damn pathetic! That's really, really bad! And the fact these "annualized" figures have changed so little since June means that growth has slowed, because otherwise said numbers would have increased (as "annualized" is based on projections). Let me explain my reasoning a bit. “Annualized” revenue is a somewhat-vague term that can mean many things, but taking The Information’s definition from mid-June (when annualized revenue was $3.4 billion), annualized revenue is “a measure of the past month’s revenue multiplied by 12.” That suggests that OpenAI’s revenue in that month was $283 million, a number which the New York Times updated in their piece, saying that OpenAI made $300 million of revenue in the month of August, which works out to $3.6 billion in annualized revenue, and OpenAI expects to hit $3.7 billion this year, which works out to $308 million. Just so we’re abundantly clear — this means that OpenAI, unquestionably the leader and most-prominent brand and the first thought anybody will have when integrating generative AI, is only making about $80 million a month selling access to its models? This heavily-suggests that generative AI, as a technology, doesn’t necessarily have a product-market fit. According to a survey by Andreessen Horowitz earlier in the year, “the 2023 market share of closed-source models [was estimated at] 80 to 90%, with the majority of share going to OpenAI.” Another survey from IOT Analytics published late last year suggests that number might look a little bit different, with 39% of the market share going to OpenAI and 30% going to Microsoft. Assuming that the latter numbers are true, this suggests that the generative AI market is incredibly small. If OpenAI — which dominates with, I’d wager, at least a 30% market share — is only making $1 billion a year from selling access to its models, and at this stage in the massively-inflated hype bubble, there may not even be $10 billion of annual revenue from companies integrating generative AI into their products. And let’s be honest, this is where all of the money should be. If this stuff is the future of everything, why is the revenue stream so painfully weak? Why isn’t generative AI in everything — not just big apps and services hoping to ride a wave as it crests, oblivious to the imminent collapse — but all apps, and present in a big way, where it’s core to the app’s functionality? OpenAI making so little selling access to their models suggests that, despite the hype-cycle, there either isn’t the interest in integrating these products from developers, or these integrations aren’t that useful, attractive or impressive to users. Again, these products are charged on usage — and so, it’s possible for generative AI to be integrated into a service, but not actually drive much revenue for OpenAI. While ChatGPT has brand recognition, companies integrating OpenAI’s models in their products are far more indicative of the long-term health of both the company and the industry itself, because if OpenAI can’t convince people to integrate and use this shit, do you really think other companies are succeeding? There are two counterarguments: While I can’t say for certain, and I’ll happily admit if I’m wrong in the future, the numbers here suggest that OpenAI’s cloud services business — as in integrating its supposedly industry-leading technology into other products — is nowhere near as viable a business as selling subscriptions to ChatGPT, which in turn suggests that there is either a lack of interest in integrating generative AI, a lack of adoption once said integration has happened, or a lack of usage by users of features powered by generative AI itself. The only other avenue is that OpenAI isn’t charging what it believes these services are worth. As discussed earlier in the piece, OpenAI needs to more-than-triple revenue in the next 15 months to hit $11.6 billion in sales. Furthermore, at its current burn rate, OpenAI is currently spending $2.35 to make $1 — meaning that $11.6 billion in revenue will cost $27 billion to make. While costs could foreseeably come down, all signs point to them increasing. As noted above, GPT-4 cost $100 million to train, and more complex future models will cost hundreds of millions or even a billion dollars to train. The Information also estimated back in July that OpenAI's training costs would balloon to $3 billion in 2024, and it’s fair to assume that models like o1 and GPT-5 (also known as “Orion”) will be significantly more expensive to train. OpenAI also has a popularity problem. While it’s usually great news that a product has 300 million free users, every single time somebody uses the service costs OpenAI money, and lots of it. The Information estimated OpenAI will spend around $4 billion on server costs in 2024 to run ChatGPT and host other companies running services using GPT and its other models, effectively meaning that every dollar of revenue is immediately eaten by the costs of acquiring it. And that’s before you factor in paying the more-than 1,500 people that work at the company (another $1.5 billion in costs alone, and OpenAI expects to hire another 200 by the end of the year), and other costs like real estate and taxes. As a result, I am now updating my hypothesis. I believe that OpenAI, once it has raised its current ($6.5 billion to $7 billion) round, will have to raise another round of at least the same size by July 2025, if not sooner. To quote the New York Times’ reporting, “fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products.” OpenAI could potentially reduce costs, but has shown little proof that it’s able to, and its one attempt (the more efficient “Arrakis” model) failed to launch. One would also imagine that this company — now burning $5 billion a year — is doing all it can to try and bring costs down, and even if it isn’t, I severely doubt that it’s possible to. After all, Anthropic is facing exactly the same problem, and is on course to lose $2.7 billion in 2024 on $800 million in revenue, which makes me think the likelihood of this being a quick fix is extremely low. There is, however, another problem, one caused by their current fundraise. OpenAI is, at present, raising $6.5 to $7 billion in capital at a $150 billion valuation. Assuming it completes this raise — which is likely to happen — it will mean that all future rounds have to be at either $150 billion or higher. A lower valuation (called a down-round) would both upset current investors and send a loud signal to the market that the company is having trouble, which overwhelmingly suggests that OpenAI’s only way to survive is to raise its next round at a valuation of $200 billion, and require yet another giant raise, likely of at least $10 billion. For context, the biggest IPO valuation in US corporate history was Alibaba, which debuted onto the New York Stock Exchange with a market cap of nearly $170bn. That figure is more than double the runner-up, Facebook, which had a value of $81bn. Are you telling me that OpenAI — a company that burns vast piles of money like the Joker in The Dark Knight, and has no obvious path to profitability, and a dubious addressable market — is worth more than Alibaba, which, even a decade ago, was a giant of a company? Further souring the terms are its prior commitments to Microsoft, which owns 75% of all future profits (ha!) until it recoups its $13 billion investment, after which point it receives 49% of all profits until it is paid $1.56 trillion dollars, or 120 times the original amount, though the move to a non-profit structure may remove the limits on OpenAI’s ridiculous “profit participation units” where previous investors are given a slice of (theoretical) profits from the least profitable company in the world. Nevertheless, Microsoft’s iron grip on the future profits of this company — as well as complete access to its research and technology — means that anyone investing is effectively agreeing to help Microsoft out, and makes any stock (or PPUs) that Microsoft owns far more valuable. There’s also the other problem: how OpenAI converts its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit, and whether that’s actually possible. Investors are, according to the New York Times, hedging their bets. OpenAI has two years from the deal’s close to convert to a for-profit company, or its funding will convert into debt at a 9% interest rate. As a result, OpenAI now faces multiple challenges: Also, at some point, OpenAI will have to work out a way to go public, because otherwise there is absolutely no reason to invest in this company, unless you are doing so with the belief that you will be able to offload your shares in a future secondary sale. At that point, OpenAI resembles a kind of investment scam where new investors exist only to help old investors liquidate their assets rather than anyone investing in the actual value of the company itself. And, after that, OpenAI will still need to raise more rounds of funding. ChatGPT’s free version is a poison in its system, a marketing channel that burns billions of dollars to introduce people to a product that only ten million people will actually pay for, and its future depends largely on its ability to continue convincing people to use it. And in a few months, OpenAI’s integration with Apple devices launches, meaning that millions of people will now start using ChatGPT for free on their iPhones, with OpenAI footing the bill in the hopes they’ll upgrade to ChatGPT Plus, at which point Apple will take $6 of the $20 a month subscription. How does this continue? How does OpenAI survive? I realize I’ve been a little repetitive in this piece, but it’s really important to focus on the fact that the leader in the generative AI space does not appear to make that much money (less than 30% of its revenue) helping people put generative AI in their products, and makes most of their money selling subscriptions to a product that mostly coasts on hype. While it may seem impressive that OpenAI has 10 million paying subscribers, that’s the result of literally every AI story mentioning its name in almost every media outlet, and its name being on the lips of basically everybody in the entirety of the tech industry — and a chunk of the business world at large. Worse still, arguably the most important product that OpenAI sells is access to its models, and it’s the least-viable part of its business, despite “GPT” being synonymous with the concept of integrating generative AI into your company. Because access to its APIs isn’t a particularly big business, OpenAI’s hopes of hitting its revenue goals is almost entirely contingent on ChatGPT Plus continuing to grow. While this might happen in the short term (though research suggests that 11% of customers stop paying after a month and 26% after three months), ChatGPT Plus has no real moat, little product differentiation (outside of its advanced voice mode, which Meta is already working on a competitor to), and increasing commoditization from other models, open source platforms, and even on-device models (like on Copilot+-powered PCs). The features that ChatGPT is best known for — generating code, summarizing meetings, brainstorming and generating stuff — can be done on any number of other platforms, in many cases for free, and OpenAI’s biggest competitor to ChatGPT Plus is ChatGPT itself. And I cannot express enough how bad a sign it is that its cloud business is so thin. The largest player in the supposedly most important industry ever can only scrounge together $1 billion in annual revenue selling access to the most well-known model in the industry. This suggests a fundamental weakness in the revenue model behind GPT, as well as a fundamental weakness in the generative artificial intelligence market writ large. If OpenAI cannot make more than a billion dollars of revenue off of this, then it’s fair to assume that there is either a lack of interest from developers or a lack of interest from the consumers those developers are serving. Remember when I said that OpenAI mentioned in its recent Devay that it had “cut costs for developers to access [their] API by 99% in the last two years” (which Max Zeff of TechCrunch posits may be due to price pressure from Google and Meta)? That suggests that OpenAI really has no room to start charging more for access to its APIs. This technology is commoditized, with few points of differentiation. It can’t, for example, raise prices for the sake of a better, more capable product. OpenAI is trapped. All of this is happening at a time when an astronomical amount of talent is leaving the company — the talent that OpenAI desperately needs to build products that people will actually pay for. At this point, it’s hard to see how OpenAI survives. To continue growing ChatGPT Plus, it will have to create meaningful, mass-market use cases, or hope it can coast on a relatively-specious hype wave, one that will have to be so powerful it effectively triples its users. Even then, OpenAI will have to both find ways to give developers more reasons to integrate its models while making sure that said models provide a service that the end-user will actually appreciate, which is heavily-reliant on both the underlying technology and the ability of developers to create meaningful products with it. And OpenAI is getting desperate. According to Fortune, OpenAI’s culture is deeply brittle, with a “relentless pressure to introduce products” rushing its o1 model to market as Sam Altman was “eager to prove to potential investors in the company’s latest funding round that OpenAI remains at the forefront of AI development” despite staff saying it wasn’t ready. These aren’t the actions of a company that’s on the forefront of anything — they’re desperate moves made by desperate people burning the candle at both ends. Yet, once you get past these problems, you run head-first into the largest one: that generative AI is deeply unprofitable to run. When every subscriber or API call loses you money, growth only exists to help flog your company to investors, and at some point investors will begin to question whether this company can stand on its own two feet. It can’t. OpenAI is a disaster in the making, and behind it sits a potentially bigger, nastier disaster — a lack of any real strength in the generative AI market. If OpenAI can only make a billion dollars as the leader in this market (with $200 million of that coming from Microsoft reselling its models), it heavily suggests that there is neither developer nor user interest in generative AI products. Perhaps it’s the hallucination problem, or perhaps it’s just that generative AI isn’t something that produces particularly-interesting interactions with a user. While you could argue that “somebody can work out a really cool product,” it’s time to ask why Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI, Apple, and Microsoft have failed to make one in the last two years. Though ChatGPT Plus is popular, it’s clear that it operates — much like ChatGPT — as a way of seeing what generative AI can do rather than a product that customers love. I see no viable way for OpenAI to grow this product at the rate it needs to be grown, and that’s before considering its total lack of profit. I hypothesize that OpenAI will successfully close its $150 billion round in the next few weeks, but that growth is already slowing, and will slow dramatically as we enter the new year. I believe the upcoming earnings from Microsoft and Google will further dampen excitement around generative AI, which in turn will reduce the likelihood that developers will integrate GPT further into their products, while also likely depressing market interest in ChatGPT writ large. While this bubble can continue coasting for a while, nothing about the OpenAI story looks good. This is a company lost, bleeding money with every interaction with the customer, flogging software that’s at best kind-of useful and at worst actively harmful. Unless something significantly changes — like a breakthrough in energy or compute efficiency — I can’t see how this company makes it another two years. Worse still, If my hypothesis about the wider generative AI market is true, then there might simply not be a viable business in providing these services. While Meta and OpenAI might be able to claim hundreds of millions of people use these services, I see no evidence that these are products that millions of people will pay for long-term. For me to be wrong, these companies will have to solve multiple intractable problems, come up with entirely-new use cases, and raise historic amounts of capital. If I’m right, we’re watching venture capitalists and companies like Microsoft burn tens of billions of dollars to power the next generation of products that nobody gives a shit about.

Title: OpenAI Is A Bad Business

Time Published: 2024-10-09T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
OpenAI, a non-profit AI company that will lose anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion this year, will at some point in the next six or so months convert into a for-profit AI company, at which point it will continue to lose money in exactly the same way. Shortly after this news broke, Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati resigned, followed by Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew and VP of Research, Post Training Barret Zoph, leaving OpenAI with exactly three of its eleven cofounders remaining. This coincides suspiciously with OpenAI's increasingly-absurd fundraising efforts, where (as I predicted in late July) OpenAI has raised the largest venture-backed fundraise of all time $6.6 billion— at a valuation of $157 billion. Yet despite the high likelihood of the round's success, there are quite a few things to be worried about. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Apple is no longer in talks to join the round, and while one can only speculate about its reasoning, it's fair to assume that Apple (AAPL), on signing a non-disclosure agreement, was able to see exactly what OpenAI had (or had not) got behind the curtain, as well as its likely-grim financial picture, and decided to walk away. Nevertheless, both NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) are both investing, with Microsoft, according to the Wall Street Journal, pushing another $1 billion into the company — though it's unclear whether that's in real money or in "cloud credits" that allow OpenAI to continue using Microsoft's cloud. Yet arguably the most worrying sign is that SoftBank's Vision Fund will be investing $500 million in OpenAI. While it might seem a little weird to be worried about a half-billion dollar check, SoftBank — best-known for sinking $16 billion or more into WeWork and getting swindled by its founder, and dumping a further €900m into Wirecard, which turned out to be an outright fraud, with one founder now a fugitive from justice in Russia — is some of the dumbest money in the market, and a sign that any company taking it is likely a little desperate. While SoftBank has had a number of hits — NVIDIA, ARM and Alibaba, to name a few — it is famous for piling cash into terrible businesses, like Katerra (a construction company that died despite a $2 billion investment in 2021) and Zume Pizza (a robotic pizza company with a product that never worked that closed after raising more than $400 million, with $375 million coming from SoftBank). In any case, OpenAI will likely prevail and raise this round from a cadre of investors that will have to invest a minimum of $250 million to put money behind a company that has never turned a profit, that has no path to profitability, and has yet to create a truly meaningful product outside of Sam Altman's marketing expertise. This round is a farce — a group delusion, one borne of one man's uncanny ability to convince clueless idiots that he has some unique insight, despite the fact that all signs point to him knowing about as much as they do, allowing him to prop up an unsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company as a means of getting billions of dollars of equity in the company — and no, I don't care what he says to the contrary. Last week, the New York Times reported that OpenAI would lose $5 billion in 2024 (which The Information had estimated back in July), and that the company expected to raise the price of ChatGPT's premium product to $44-a-month over the next five years, and intended to increase the price of ChatGPT to $22-a-month by the end of 2024, a pale horse I've warned you of in the past. Interestingly (and worryingly), the article also confirms another hypothesis of mine — that "fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products" - in simpler terms, that OpenAI will likely raise $6.5 billion in funding, and then have to do so again in short order, likely in perpetuity. The Times also reports that OpenAI is making estimates that I would describe as "fucking ridiculous." OpenAI's monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, and the company expects to make $3.7 billion in revenue this year (the company will, as mentioned, lose $5 billion anyway), yet the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it's not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1. OpenAI loses money every single time that somebody uses their product, and while it might make money selling premium subscriptions, I severely doubt it’s turning a profit on these customers, and certainly losing money on any and all power users. As I've said before, I believe there's also a subprime AI crisis brewing because OpenAI's API services — which lets people integrate its various models into external products — is currently priced at a loss, and increasing prices will likely make this product unsustainable for many businesses currently relying on these discounted rates. As I've said before, OpenAI is unprofitable, unsustainable and untenable in its current form, but I think it's important to explain exactly how untenable it is, and I'm going to start with a few statements: And, fundamentally, I can find no compelling evidence that suggests that OpenAI will be able to sustain this growth. In fact, I can find no historical comparison, and believe that OpenAI's growth is already stumbling. Let's take a look, shall we? To do this right, we have to lay out exactly how OpenAI makes money. According to the New York Times, OpenAI expects ChatGPT to make about $2.7 billion in revenue in 2024, with an additional $1 billion coming from "other businesses using its technology." Let's break this down. As a result of these numbers, I have major concerns about the viability of OpenAI's business, and the generative AI market at large. If OpenAI — the most prominent name in all of generative AI — is only making a billion dollars a year from this, what does that say about the larger growth trajectory of this company, or actual usage of generative AI products? I'll get to that in a bit. First, we've gotta talk about the dollars. So, as it stands, OpenAI makes the majority — more than 70% — of its revenue from selling premium access to ChatGPT. A few weeks ago, The Information reported that ChatGPT Plus had "more than 10 million paying subscribers," and that it had 1 million more that were paying for "higher-priced plans for business teams." As I've laid out above, this means that OpenAI is making about $200 million a month from consumer subscribers, but "business teams" is an indeterminate split between teams ($25-a-user-a-month paid annually) and enterprise (at least $60-a-user-a-month, paid annually, with a minimum of 150 seats). One important detail: 100,000 of the 1 million business customers are workers at management consultancy PwC, which has also become OpenAI's "first partner for selling enterprise offerings to other businesses." It isn't clear whether these are enterprise accounts or teams accounts, or whether PwC is paying full price (I'd wager it isn’t). Here’s how this would play out in revenue terms across several assumed divisions of the customer base, and an assumption that every Teams customer is paying $27.5 (that plan costs either $25 or $30, depending on whether you pay monthly or yearly, but for the sake of fairness, I went with the middle ground). From there, we can run some hypothetical monthly revenue numbers based on a million "higher-priced plans for business teams." Sadly, I don't think things are that good, and I honestly don't think these would be particularly-impressive numbers to begin with. We can actually make a more-precise estimate by working backwards from the New York Times' estimates. ChatGPT Plus has 10 million customers, making OpenAI around $2.4 billion dollars a year (ten million users spending $20 each month equates to $200 million. Multiply that by 12, you get $2.4 billion). This means that business users make up about $300 million a year in revenue, or $25 million a month. That is, to be frank, extremely bad. These are estimates, but even if they were doubled, these would not be particularly exciting numbers. For all the excitement about OpenAI's revenue — putting aside the fact that it spends $2.35 to make $1 — the majority of the money it makes is from subscriptions to ChatGPT Plus for consumers, though one can fairly say there are professionals that use it under the consumer version too. While 10 million paying subscribers might seem like a lot, "ChatGPT" is effectively to generative AI what "Google" is to search. Ten million people paying for this is table stakes. OpenAI has been covered by effectively every single media outlet, is mentioned in almost every single conversation about AI (even when it's not about generative AI!), and has the backing and marketing push of Microsoft and the entirety of Silicon Valley behind it. ChatGPT has over 200 million weekly users, and the New York Times reports that OpenAI has "350 million people use [OpenAI's] services each month as of June" (though it's unclear if that includes those using the API). Collectively, this means that OpenAI — the most popular company in the industry — can only convert about 3% of its users. This might be because it's not obvious why anyone should pay for a premium subscription. Paying for ChatGPT Plus doesn't dramatically change the product, nor does it offer a particularly-compelling new use case for anyone other than power users. As a company, OpenAI is flat-out terrible at product. While it may be able to attract hundreds of millions of people to dick around with ChatGPT (losing money with every prompt), it's hard to convert them because you have to, on some level, show the user what ChatGPT can do to get them to pay for it… and there isn't really much you can charge for, other than limiting how many times they can use it. And, if we're honest, it still isn't obvious why anyone should use ChatGPT in the first place, other than the fact everybody is talking about it. You can ask it to generate something — a picture, a few paragraphs, perhaps a question — and at that point say "cool" and move on. I can absolutely see how there are people who regularly use ChatGPT's natural language prompts to answer questions that they can't quite phrase (a word that's on the tip of their tongue, a question they're not sure how to phrase, or to brainstorm something) but beyond that, there really is no "sticky" part of this product beyond "a search engine that talks back to you." That product is extremely commoditized. The free version of ChatGPT is effectively identical to the free version of Anthropic's Claude, Meta's AI assistant, Microsoft's Copilot, and even Twitter's "Grok." They all use similar training data, all give similar outputs, and are all free. Why would you pay for ChatGPT Plus when Meta or Microsoft will give you their own spin on the same flavor? Other than pure brand recognition, what is it that ChatGPT does that Copilot (powered by ChatGPT) doesn't? And does that matter to the average user? I'd argue it doesn't. I'd also argue that those willing to pay for a "Plus" subscription are more likely to use the platform way, way more than free users, which in turn may (as one Redditor hypothesized regarding Anthropic's "Claude Pro" subscription) lose it the revenue on said premium subscriber. While there's a chance that OpenAI could have a chunk of users that aren't particularly active, one cannot run a business based on selling stuff you hope that people won't use. I’ll touch on customer churn later, but one more note about ChatGPT Plus users: as with any other consumer-centric subscription product, these customers are far more likely to cut their spending when they no longer feel like they’re getting value from their product, or when their household budgets demand it. Netflix — the biggest name in streaming — lost a million customers in 2022, around the time of the cost-of-living crisis (and, from 2025, it plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers altogether) ChatGPT Plus is likely, for many people, a “lifestyle product.” And the problem is that, when people lose their jobs or inflation hikes, these products are the first to get slashed from the household budget. OpenAI also has a unique problem that makes it entirely different to most SaaS solutions — the cost of delivering the solution. While 3% conversion of free customers to paying customers might regularly be on the low side of "good," said solutions are nowhere near as expensive as running software using generative AI. There's also another wrinkle. If the majority of OpenAI's revenue — over 70% — comes from people paying for ChatGPT Plus, then that heavily suggests the majority of its compute costs come from what is arguably its least-profitable product. The only alternative is that OpenAI's compute costs are so high that, despite making two-thirds of its revenue, ChatGPT creates so much overhead that it sours the rest of the business. You see, ChatGPT Plus is not a great business. It's remarkable that OpenAI found 10 million people to pay for it, but how do you grow that to 20 million, or 40 million? These aren't idle questions, either. At present, OpenAI makes $225 million a month — $2.7 billion a year — by selling premium subscriptions to ChatGPT. To hit a revenue target of $11.6 billion in 2025, OpenAI would need to increase revenue from ChatGPT customers by 310%. If we consider the current ratio of Plus subscriptions to Teams and Enterprise subscriptions — about 88.89% to 11.11% — OpenAI would need to find 18.29 million paying users (assuming a price increase of $2 a month), while also retaining every single one of its current ChatGPT Plus users at a new price point, for a total $7.4 billion, or $616 million or so a month. It would also have to make $933 million in revenue from its business or enterprise clients, which, again, would require OpenAI to more-than-triple their current users. OpenAI's primary revenue source is one of the most easily-commoditized things in the world — a Large Language Model in a web browser — and its competitor is Mark Zuckerberg, a petty king with a huge warchest that can never, ever be fired, even with significant investor pressure. Even if that wasn't the case, the premium product that OpenAI sells is far from endearing, still looking for a killer app a year-and-a-half into its existence, with its biggest competitor being the free version of ChatGPT. There are ways that OpenAI could potentially turn this around, but even a battalion of experienced salespeople will still need paying, and will have the immediate job of "increase revenue by 300%" for a product that most people have trouble explaining. No, really. What is ChatGPT? Can you give me an answer that actually explains what the product does? What is the compelling use case that makes this a must-have? I am hammering this point because this is the majority of OpenAI's revenue. OpenAI lives and dies on the revenue gained from ChatGPT, a product that hasn't meaningfully changed since it launched beyond adding new models that do, for most users, exactly the same thing. While some might find ChatGPT's voice mode interesting, "interesting" just isn't good enough today. And to drill down further, the majority of OpenAI's revenue is from ChatGPT Plus, not its Enterprise or Teams product, meaning that hiring a sales team is far from practical. How do you sell this to consumers, or professionals? Even Microsoft, which has a vast marketing apparatus and deep pockets, struggled to sell Copilot — which is based on OpenAI’s GPT models — on its weird (and presumably expensive) Superbowl ads, or on the countless commercials that dotted the 2024 Olympic Games. To triple users, ChatGPT must meaningfully change, and do so immediately, or disclose multiple meaningful, powerful use cases that are so impressive that 18 million new people agree to pay $22 a month. That is an incredible — and some might say insane — goal, and one that I do not think this company is capable of achieving. Yet this is far from the most worrying part of the current OpenAI story. What's astounded me about this whole story is how little of OpenAI's revenue comes from providing other companies the means to integrate generative AI into their systems, for two big reasons: In the event that OpenAI and Microsoft are each making about a billion dollars in annualized revenue — again, these are estimates based on current growth trajectories — it heavily suggests that there is...two billion dollars of revenue? For Microsoft and OpenAI combined? That's god damn pathetic! That's really, really bad! And the fact these "annualized" figures have changed so little since June means that growth has slowed, because otherwise said numbers would have increased (as "annualized" is based on projections). Let me explain my reasoning a bit. “Annualized” revenue is a somewhat-vague term that can mean many things, but taking The Information’s definition from mid-June (when annualized revenue was $3.4 billion), annualized revenue is “a measure of the past month’s revenue multiplied by 12.” That suggests that OpenAI’s revenue in that month was $283 million, a number which the New York Times updated in their piece, saying that OpenAI made $300 million of revenue in the month of August, which works out to $3.6 billion in annualized revenue, and OpenAI expects to hit $3.7 billion this year, which works out to $308 million. Just so we’re abundantly clear — this means that OpenAI, unquestionably the leader and most-prominent brand and the first thought anybody will have when integrating generative AI, is only making about $80 million a month selling access to its models? This heavily-suggests that generative AI, as a technology, doesn’t necessarily have a product-market fit. According to a survey by Andreessen Horowitz earlier in the year, “the 2023 market share of closed-source models [was estimated at] 80 to 90%, with the majority of share going to OpenAI.” Another survey from IOT Analytics published late last year suggests that number might look a little bit different, with 39% of the market share going to OpenAI and 30% going to Microsoft. Assuming that the latter numbers are true, this suggests that the generative AI market is incredibly small. If OpenAI — which dominates with, I’d wager, at least a 30% market share — is only making $1 billion a year from selling access to its models, and at this stage in the massively-inflated hype bubble, there may not even be $10 billion of annual revenue from companies integrating generative AI into their products. And let’s be honest, this is where all of the money should be. If this stuff is the future of everything, why is the revenue stream so painfully weak? Why isn’t generative AI in everything — not just big apps and services hoping to ride a wave as it crests, oblivious to the imminent collapse — but all apps, and present in a big way, where it’s core to the app’s functionality? OpenAI making so little selling access to their models suggests that, despite the hype-cycle, there either isn’t the interest in integrating these products from developers, or these integrations aren’t that useful, attractive or impressive to users. Again, these products are charged on usage — and so, it’s possible for generative AI to be integrated into a service, but not actually drive much revenue for OpenAI. While ChatGPT has brand recognition, companies integrating OpenAI’s models in their products are far more indicative of the long-term health of both the company and the industry itself, because if OpenAI can’t convince people to integrate and use this shit, do you really think other companies are succeeding? There are two counterarguments: While I can’t say for certain, and I’ll happily admit if I’m wrong in the future, the numbers here suggest that OpenAI’s cloud services business — as in integrating its supposedly industry-leading technology into other products — is nowhere near as viable a business as selling subscriptions to ChatGPT, which in turn suggests that there is either a lack of interest in integrating generative AI, a lack of adoption once said integration has happened, or a lack of usage by users of features powered by generative AI itself. The only other avenue is that OpenAI isn’t charging what it believes these services are worth. As discussed earlier in the piece, OpenAI needs to more-than-triple revenue in the next 15 months to hit $11.6 billion in sales. Furthermore, at its current burn rate, OpenAI is currently spending $2.35 to make $1 — meaning that $11.6 billion in revenue will cost $27 billion to make. While costs could foreseeably come down, all signs point to them increasing. As noted above, GPT-4 cost $100 million to train, and more complex future models will cost hundreds of millions or even a billion dollars to train. The Information also estimated back in July that OpenAI's training costs would balloon to $3 billion in 2024, and it’s fair to assume that models like o1 and GPT-5 (also known as “Orion”) will be significantly more expensive to train. OpenAI also has a popularity problem. While it’s usually great news that a product has 300 million free users, every single time somebody uses the service costs OpenAI money, and lots of it. The Information estimated OpenAI will spend around $4 billion on server costs in 2024 to run ChatGPT and host other companies running services using GPT and its other models, effectively meaning that every dollar of revenue is immediately eaten by the costs of acquiring it. And that’s before you factor in paying the more-than 1,500 people that work at the company (another $1.5 billion in costs alone, and OpenAI expects to hire another 200 by the end of the year), and other costs like real estate and taxes. As a result, I am now updating my hypothesis. I believe that OpenAI, once it has raised its current ($6.5 billion to $7 billion) round, will have to raise another round of at least the same size by July 2025, if not sooner. To quote the New York Times’ reporting, “fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products.” OpenAI could potentially reduce costs, but has shown little proof that it’s able to, and its one attempt (the more efficient “Arrakis” model) failed to launch. One would also imagine that this company — now burning $5 billion a year — is doing all it can to try and bring costs down, and even if it isn’t, I severely doubt that it’s possible to. After all, Anthropic is facing exactly the same problem, and is on course to lose $2.7 billion in 2024 on $800 million in revenue, which makes me think the likelihood of this being a quick fix is extremely low. There is, however, another problem, one caused by their current fundraise. OpenAI is, at present, raising $6.5 to $7 billion in capital at a $150 billion valuation. Assuming it completes this raise — which is likely to happen — it will mean that all future rounds have to be at either $150 billion or higher. A lower valuation (called a down-round) would both upset current investors and send a loud signal to the market that the company is having trouble, which overwhelmingly suggests that OpenAI’s only way to survive is to raise its next round at a valuation of $200 billion, and require yet another giant raise, likely of at least $10 billion. For context, the biggest IPO valuation in US corporate history was Alibaba, which debuted onto the New York Stock Exchange with a market cap of nearly $170bn. That figure is more than double the runner-up, Facebook, which had a value of $81bn. Are you telling me that OpenAI — a company that burns vast piles of money like the Joker in The Dark Knight, and has no obvious path to profitability, and a dubious addressable market — is worth more than Alibaba, which, even a decade ago, was a giant of a company? Further souring the terms are its prior commitments to Microsoft, which owns 75% of all future profits (ha!) until it recoups its $13 billion investment, after which point it receives 49% of all profits until it is paid $1.56 trillion dollars, or 120 times the original amount, though the move to a non-profit structure may remove the limits on OpenAI’s ridiculous “profit participation units” where previous investors are given a slice of (theoretical) profits from the least profitable company in the world. Nevertheless, Microsoft’s iron grip on the future profits of this company — as well as complete access to its research and technology — means that anyone investing is effectively agreeing to help Microsoft out, and makes any stock (or PPUs) that Microsoft owns far more valuable. There’s also the other problem: how OpenAI converts its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit, and whether that’s actually possible. Investors are, according to the New York Times, hedging their bets. OpenAI has two years from the deal’s close to convert to a for-profit company, or its funding will convert into debt at a 9% interest rate. As a result, OpenAI now faces multiple challenges: Also, at some point, OpenAI will have to work out a way to go public, because otherwise there is absolutely no reason to invest in this company, unless you are doing so with the belief that you will be able to offload your shares in a future secondary sale. At that point, OpenAI resembles a kind of investment scam where new investors exist only to help old investors liquidate their assets rather than anyone investing in the actual value of the company itself. And, after that, OpenAI will still need to raise more rounds of funding. ChatGPT’s free version is a poison in its system, a marketing channel that burns billions of dollars to introduce people to a product that only ten million people will actually pay for, and its future depends largely on its ability to continue convincing people to use it. And in a few months, OpenAI’s integration with Apple devices launches, meaning that millions of people will now start using ChatGPT for free on their iPhones, with OpenAI footing the bill in the hopes they’ll upgrade to ChatGPT Plus, at which point Apple will take $6 of the $20 a month subscription. How does this continue? How does OpenAI survive? I realize I’ve been a little repetitive in this piece, but it’s really important to focus on the fact that the leader in the generative AI space does not appear to make that much money (less than 30% of its revenue) helping people put generative AI in their products, and makes most of their money selling subscriptions to a product that mostly coasts on hype. While it may seem impressive that OpenAI has 10 million paying subscribers, that’s the result of literally every AI story mentioning its name in almost every media outlet, and its name being on the lips of basically everybody in the entirety of the tech industry — and a chunk of the business world at large. Worse still, arguably the most important product that OpenAI sells is access to its models, and it’s the least-viable part of its business, despite “GPT” being synonymous with the concept of integrating generative AI into your company. Because access to its APIs isn’t a particularly big business, OpenAI’s hopes of hitting its revenue goals is almost entirely contingent on ChatGPT Plus continuing to grow. While this might happen in the short term (though research suggests that 11% of customers stop paying after a month and 26% after three months), ChatGPT Plus has no real moat, little product differentiation (outside of its advanced voice mode, which Meta is already working on a competitor to), and increasing commoditization from other models, open source platforms, and even on-device models (like on Copilot+-powered PCs). The features that ChatGPT is best known for — generating code, summarizing meetings, brainstorming and generating stuff — can be done on any number of other platforms, in many cases for free, and OpenAI’s biggest competitor to ChatGPT Plus is ChatGPT itself. And I cannot express enough how bad a sign it is that its cloud business is so thin. The largest player in the supposedly most important industry ever can only scrounge together $1 billion in annual revenue selling access to the most well-known model in the industry. This suggests a fundamental weakness in the revenue model behind GPT, as well as a fundamental weakness in the generative artificial intelligence market writ large. If OpenAI cannot make more than a billion dollars of revenue off of this, then it’s fair to assume that there is either a lack of interest from developers or a lack of interest from the consumers those developers are serving. Remember when I said that OpenAI mentioned in its recent Devay that it had “cut costs for developers to access [their] API by 99% in the last two years” (which Max Zeff of TechCrunch posits may be due to price pressure from Google and Meta)? That suggests that OpenAI really has no room to start charging more for access to its APIs. This technology is commoditized, with few points of differentiation. It can’t, for example, raise prices for the sake of a better, more capable product. OpenAI is trapped. All of this is happening at a time when an astronomical amount of talent is leaving the company — the talent that OpenAI desperately needs to build products that people will actually pay for. At this point, it’s hard to see how OpenAI survives. To continue growing ChatGPT Plus, it will have to create meaningful, mass-market use cases, or hope it can coast on a relatively-specious hype wave, one that will have to be so powerful it effectively triples its users. Even then, OpenAI will have to both find ways to give developers more reasons to integrate its models while making sure that said models provide a service that the end-user will actually appreciate, which is heavily-reliant on both the underlying technology and the ability of developers to create meaningful products with it. And OpenAI is getting desperate. According to Fortune, OpenAI’s culture is deeply brittle, with a “relentless pressure to introduce products” rushing its o1 model to market as Sam Altman was “eager to prove to potential investors in the company’s latest funding round that OpenAI remains at the forefront of AI development” despite staff saying it wasn’t ready. These aren’t the actions of a company that’s on the forefront of anything — they’re desperate moves made by desperate people burning the candle at both ends. Yet, once you get past these problems, you run head-first into the largest one: that generative AI is deeply unprofitable to run. When every subscriber or API call loses you money, growth only exists to help flog your company to investors, and at some point investors will begin to question whether this company can stand on its own two feet. It can’t. OpenAI is a disaster in the making, and behind it sits a potentially bigger, nastier disaster — a lack of any real strength in the generative AI market. If OpenAI can only make a billion dollars as the leader in this market (with $200 million of that coming from Microsoft reselling its models), it heavily suggests that there is neither developer nor user interest in generative AI products. Perhaps it’s the hallucination problem, or perhaps it’s just that generative AI isn’t something that produces particularly-interesting interactions with a user. While you could argue that “somebody can work out a really cool product,” it’s time to ask why Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI, Apple, and Microsoft have failed to make one in the last two years. Though ChatGPT Plus is popular, it’s clear that it operates — much like ChatGPT — as a way of seeing what generative AI can do rather than a product that customers love. I see no viable way for OpenAI to grow this product at the rate it needs to be grown, and that’s before considering its total lack of profit. I hypothesize that OpenAI will successfully close its $150 billion round in the next few weeks, but that growth is already slowing, and will slow dramatically as we enter the new year. I believe the upcoming earnings from Microsoft and Google will further dampen excitement around generative AI, which in turn will reduce the likelihood that developers will integrate GPT further into their products, while also likely depressing market interest in ChatGPT writ large. While this bubble can continue coasting for a while, nothing about the OpenAI story looks good. This is a company lost, bleeding money with every interaction with the customer, flogging software that’s at best kind-of useful and at worst actively harmful. Unless something significantly changes — like a breakthrough in energy or compute efficiency — I can’t see how this company makes it another two years. Worse still, If my hypothesis about the wider generative AI market is true, then there might simply not be a viable business in providing these services. While Meta and OpenAI might be able to claim hundreds of millions of people use these services, I see no evidence that these are products that millions of people will pay for long-term. For me to be wrong, these companies will have to solve multiple intractable problems, come up with entirely-new use cases, and raise historic amounts of capital. If I’m right, we’re watching venture capitalists and companies like Microsoft burn tens of billions of dollars to power the next generation of products that nobody gives a shit about.

Pay no attention to the global investment corporations that are vying for access to the natural resources—like lithium—in North Carolina’s landscape, and the shadowy business with no substantial presence in the marketplace, whose agents are running the property valuation operations! Confused? Allow me to explain. On the FEMA website, one can navigate to a webpage that discloses the recipients of certain federal FEMA contracts, and what services those contractors provide; here’s an explanation of the relationship between FEMA and the private sector: FEMA Advance Contracts for goods and services are competed [sic] and awarded in advance of major disaster declarations to provide efficient, cost-effective means for rapid delivery of supplies and services for recurring disaster response and recovery requirements. If you search for the private companies with contracts for the “Housing Inspection Services” function, you’ll see two contracts, one to “WSP USA Services, Inc.” and the other to Vanguard Inspection Services. Screenshot from FEMA webpage For context, WSP is a environmental consulting firm based out of Canada, with BlackRock and Vanguard Group being major investors. Here’s a breakdown, from The Wall Street Journal “Markets” page: Screenshot from WSJ Markets Regarding Vanguard Inspection Services, it’s got all the markers of a front company; as far as I can tell, it looks as though VIS exists solely to do business with FEMA. From the homepage of the company website: Vanguard Inspection Services is fully committed to providing complete and compliant Disaster Home Inspections under FEMA’s Housing Inspection Services (HIS) Program. VIS’s committed staff, in partnership with our cadre of Independent Contractors performing disaster housing inspections, provide a quality service to ensure disaster survivors receive the assistance they need in an expedient manner. A number of the site’s other pages appear incomplete, with many displaying random code throughout—with who knows how many millions being funneled into VIS, you’d think they’d produce a legitimate looking website, but it just looks like a hack job. (Vanguard Group is not to be confused with Vanguard Inspection Services.) Now, a Florida county government recently announced that FEMA would be conducting “free” home inspections, which is part of the process to rebuild: After Floridians apply for FEMA assistance following Hurricane Helene, a home inspection may be necessary to help determine whether the home is safe, sanitary, and livable. Per the same announcement, inspectors will consider things like livability, whether or not the utility connections and systems are in “working order,” the “structural soundness” of the domicile, and whether or not the property is “safe” to access. First of all, we need to consider the implications of home inspectors, employed in part by BlackRock and Vanguard investments, surveying the damage and assessing the value of hurricane-stricken North Carolina—especially because of the vast lithium deposits in the ground beneath and around these private properties. According to Straits Research, a major market analyst, the demand for lithium is going to explode over the next few years: The global lithium market size was valued at USD 38.2 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach a value of USD 230.4 billion by 2031, registering a CAGR of 22.1% during the forecast period (2023-2031). This is a more than 500% increase in less than a decade. Here’s this, from a report less than two weeks ago; Albemarle, a major lithium producer, is pursuing lithium production in North Carolina. Earlier this year, it announced plans to reopen the resource-rich lithium Kings Mountain mine in the state by the end of 2026, supported by $150 million in DoE funding. However, it has faced backlash from environmentalists and indigenous groups looking to block the development, which has led to delays. Albemarle is looking to expand its domestic lithium production. And, wouldn’t you know it, but BlackRock is major investor in Albemarle: On August 31, 2024, BlackRock Inc. (Trades, Portfolio), a prominent investment management firm, expanded its investment portfolio by acquiring an additional 2,220,059 shares of Albemarle Corp (NYSE:ALB). This transaction increased BlackRock's total holdings in the company to 12,183,614 shares, reflecting a significant commitment to Albemarle…. Are company agents essentially working on behalf of BlackRock and Vanguard going to be impartial parties as they value and assess the properties destroyed by Hurricane Helene? Are they going to deem these residences “liveable” and “safe” if their bosses want what’s buried beneath the homes? Is there an incentive for these contracted “home inspectors” to screw the homeowners out of their own property? Will these homes be condemned, so the BlackRock and Vanguard bosses can dole out paltry “fair market value” pennies, and become even wealthier? If I didn’t know any better, I’d reckon this is fixing to be one of the great wealth transfers in the history of the U.S. Image: Public domain. Pay no attention to the global investment corporations that are vying for access to the natural resources—like lithium—in North Carolina’s landscape, and the shadowy business with no substantial presence in the marketplace, whose agents are running the property valuation operations! Confused? Allow me to explain. On the FEMA website, one can navigate to a webpage that discloses the recipients of certain federal FEMA contracts, and what services those contractors provide; here’s an explanation of the relationship between FEMA and the private sector: FEMA Advance Contracts for goods and services are competed [sic] and awarded in advance of major disaster declarations to provide efficient, cost-effective means for rapid delivery of supplies and services for recurring disaster response and recovery requirements. If you search for the private companies with contracts for the “Housing Inspection Services” function, you’ll see two contracts, one to “WSP USA Services, Inc.” and the other to Vanguard Inspection Services. Screenshot from FEMA webpage For context, WSP is a environmental consulting firm based out of Canada, with BlackRock and Vanguard Group being major investors. Here’s a breakdown, from The Wall Street Journal “Markets” page: Screenshot from WSJ Markets Regarding Vanguard Inspection Services, it’s got all the markers of a front company; as far as I can tell, it looks as though VIS exists solely to do business with FEMA. From the homepage of the company website: Vanguard Inspection Services is fully committed to providing complete and compliant Disaster Home Inspections under FEMA’s Housing Inspection Services (HIS) Program. VIS’s committed staff, in partnership with our cadre of Independent Contractors performing disaster housing inspections, provide a quality service to ensure disaster survivors receive the assistance they need in an expedient manner. A number of the site’s other pages appear incomplete, with many displaying random code throughout—with who knows how many millions being funneled into VIS, you’d think they’d produce a legitimate looking website, but it just looks like a hack job. (Vanguard Group is not to be confused with Vanguard Inspection Services.) Now, a Florida county government recently announced that FEMA would be conducting “free” home inspections, which is part of the process to rebuild: After Floridians apply for FEMA assistance following Hurricane Helene, a home inspection may be necessary to help determine whether the home is safe, sanitary, and livable. Per the same announcement, inspectors will consider things like livability, whether or not the utility connections and systems are in “working order,” the “structural soundness” of the domicile, and whether or not the property is “safe” to access.
