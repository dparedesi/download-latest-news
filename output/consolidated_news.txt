Arkham Intelligence has published a ranked list of the 100 richest crypto entities, aggregating on-chain holdings across known address clusters and valuing them in US dollars. According to Arkham, the combined assets of the top 100 exceed “over $1.6 trillion,” underscoring the scale of capital concentrated in a relatively small set of exchanges, custodians, protocols, corporates and notable individuals. The research note was shared via X on September 9, 2025, with valuations explicitly “correct as of 2nd September 2025.” Arkham emphasizes that it ranks entities, not single wallets. In its words, “An entity represents a collection of crypto addresses confirmed to be controlled by the same individual or institution,” a grouping it argues “offers a far more accurate picture of the true net worth of these crypto whales.” Each roster entry links to the corresponding Arkham Intel page where underlying addresses and asset mixes can be examined. The top tier is dominated by centralized exchanges and large institutional platforms. Binance leads with $209.19 billion, followed by Coinbase at $155.81 billion. The third slot is Arkham’s Satoshi Nakamoto entity at $125.07 billion, reflecting the well-known early-mined BTC cluster Arkham tracks. BlackRock ranks fourth with $100.77 billion, then Lido at $69.86 billion and MicroStrategy at $53.21 billion. Fidelity Custody appears seventh at $47.46 billion, ahead of Grayscale at $34.10 billion, while Korean exchange Upbit holds $32.80 billion and DeFi protocol Aave rounds out the top ten with $31.57 billion. Beyond the top ten, the list illustrates how varied the largest balance-holders have become. Major trading venues and market infrastructure providers such as OKX, Kraken, Bitfinex, and Bybit sit alongside L2s and DeFi treasuries including Arbitrum, Uniswap, Spark, Curve and Maker’s Sky. Government-linked clusters appear as well—the “US Government” sits at rank #20 with $23.42 billion and the “UK Government” at $6.99 billion—reflecting seized or controlled assets identified on-chain. There are also long-tail categories like wrapped assets (e.g., WBTC), staking and restaking protocols (Lido, EigenLayer, Ether.fi), and even high-profile memecoin or launchpad ecosystems such as “Official Trump Meme” and “pump.fun,” each with multibillion-dollar tallies. Notably, Arkham’s framing makes clear this is a live market snapshot rather than a static “rich list.” The methodology multiplies the assets held across an entity’s tagged addresses by market prices on the specified date—September 2, 2025—so rankings can and will shift with price, inflows/outflows, and new address attributions. Arkham also spotlights the scale at the top of the distribution, summarizing on X that “the top 100 entities on Arkham hold a total of over $1.6 trillion in assets,” a figure that contextualizes the influence such entities may exert on liquidity and market structure.

Title: The Protocol: SwissBorg’s SOL Earn Wallet Exploited for $41.5M

This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk. In this issue: SWISSBORG’S SOL EARN WALLET EXPLOITED: Crypto exchange SwissBorg said about 192,600 SOL ($41.5 million) was stolen from an external wallet used exclusively for its SOL Earn strategy. The exploit stemmed from a partner's compromised application programming interface (API), a mechanism that allows software systems to communicate with one another, affecting a single counterparty, the exchange said in a post on X. It was not a hack of the SwissBorg platform. The loss affected fewer than 1% of users and represented about 2% of SwissBorg’s total assets, the firm said. All other funds and strategies remain secure, and user balances within the SwissBorg app are unaffected. SOL Earn redemptions are paused while recovery efforts proceed. SwissBorg says it will cover any shortfall, ensuring no user losses. The company is working with white-hat hackers, security firms and law enforcement to recover the funds. A full incident report will follow once investigations conclude. This exploit arrives amid a sharp rise in crypto thefts, with over $2.17 billion already stolen in 2025. — Shaurya Malwa Read more. LEDGER CTO WARNS OF PNM ATTACK: Charles Guillemet, the chief technology officer at hardware wallet maker Ledger, warned on X that a large-scale supply chain attack was underway after a reputable developer’s Node Package Manager (NPM) account was compromised. According to Guillemet, the malicious code — already pushed into packages with over 1 billion downloads — is designed to silently swap crypto wallet addresses in transactions. That means unsuspecting users could send funds directly to the attacker without realizing it. Guillemet did not name the developer whose account he said was compromised. The incident underscores how deeply interconnected open-source software is and why security lapses in developer tools can ripple into the crypto economy almost instantly. A day later, Guillemet shared that almost zero crypto users had been affected by the hack. “NPM is a tool commonly used in software development using JavaScript, which makes integrating packages easy for developers,” said Guillemet in a message to CoinDesk. When an attacker compromises a developer’s account, they can slip malicious code into widely used packages. “The malicious code attempts to drain users by swapping addresses used in transaction or general on-chain activity and replacing them with the hacker’s address,” Guillemet added. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. BACKPACK EU GOES LIVE FOLLOWING FTX EU ACQUISITION: Backpack Exchange, a global cryptocurrency trading platform, said its European division, Backpack EU, is officially live. Operating out of Cyprus and licensed under the European Union’s MiFID II framework, the exchange is positioning itself as one of the first fully regulated venues in Europe to offer crypto derivatives, starting with perpetual futures. “As far as I'm aware, it's just going to be us and Kraken” in Europe offering perpetual futures, Armani Ferrante, the CEO of Backpack, said in an interview with CoinDesk. The debut follows Backpack’s acquisition of FTX EU earlier this year. In January, the FTX bankruptcy estate said the sale of FTX EU to Backpack was not authorized. Since then, the issue has been resolved and in April the exchange began distributing funds to former FTX EU customers, fulfilling their pledge to compensate users affected by the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire. Backpack EU will provide users access to over 40 trading pairs with up to 10x leverage, the team said in a statement. The platform says it aims to give both retail and institutional traders a compliant gateway to advanced crypto trading products. The rollout also highlights Backpack’s broader strategy of rebuilding trust in digital assets following a string of exchange failures. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. POLYGON POS CHAIN EXPERIENCES FINALITY LAG: Polygon’s proof-of-stake chain is live, but transactions are taking longer than usual to lock in, with finality running 10–15 minutes behind schedule. Finality is the assurance that a transaction or piece of data is irreversible once confirmed and added to a block in the blockchain. The foundation said in an X post that a fix has been identified and is being rolled out to validators and service providers. The slowdown was tied to issues on some Bor/Erigon nodes and RPC providers, according to Polygon’s status page. Node restarts resolved the problem for many validators, while others had to rewind to the last finalized block before resyncing, a status page shared. The disruption comes weeks after Polygon’s Heimdall v2 upgrade promised 5-second finality through a modernized consensus stack. – Shaurya Malwa Read more.

Title: Larry Ellison's Rise: How He Snagged the Title of World's Richest Person From Elon Musk

Oracle's transformation into an AI infrastructure powerhouse has catapulted Larry Ellison ahead of Musk to take the title of the world's richest person. The 81-year-old database pioneer's net worth surged by more than $100 billion following the company's earnings report Tuesday, according to calculations published Wednesday by Bloomberg, which called the move "the biggest one-day increase ever recorded" by its Billionaire's Index. Ellison owns about 1.16 billion shares, or about 41% of the company. As of Tuesday's close, those shares were worth around $280 billion. If Oracle's stock price holds near current levels, Ellison's stake in Oracle would propel his net worth to $393 billion, surpassing Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, whose net worth is $385 billion. The staggering wealth increase came after Oracle announced what CEO Safra Catz called an "excellent" quarter, signing four multi-billion-dollar contracts and booking $455 billion in future cloud infrastructure revenue. Oracle's market capitalization spiked to about $950 billion in intraday trading on Wednesday, up more than $270 billion in a single day. Ellison's gains topped Musk's record for single-day rise in net worth—$63 billion in December 2024, according to Bloomberg. Oracle reported quarterly revenue of $14.9 billion, up 12% year-over-year, with cloud infrastructure revenue jumping 55% to $3.3 billion. The company's forward-looking metrics were even more headline-making: Oracle's remaining performance obligations (RPO)—essentially contracts for future revenue—grew to $455 billion in value, an increase of 359% year-over-year. "Clearly, it was an excellent quarter, and demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure continues to build," CEO Catz told investors during Tuesday's earnings call. "I expect we will sign additional multi-billion-dollar customers and that RPO will likely grow to exceed $500 billion." The company expects cloud infrastructure revenue to reach $18 billion this fiscal year. Oracle's has transformed itself from a traditional database provider into a critical player providing the infrastructure for AI companies in a desperate race for computing power. "Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads," Catz told investors, saying the company had signed contracts with OpenAI; xAI, Elon Musk's AI company; Meta Platforms, Inc. (META); Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD); and others. While Ellison's fortune has grown with Oracle's AI boom, Musk's grip on the world's richest title has been loosening throughout 2025. The Tesla CEO began the year with a net worth of $420 billion, which has since fallen to about $385 billion as Tesla shares have declined by about 14% year-to-date. Tesla has struggled with increasing competition in the electric vehicle market and a softening in demand in key markets worldwide. Musk's wealth, tied primarily to his Tesla stake, has fluctuated wildly with the automaker's volatile stock price. Though it's worth noting that Tesla recently floated a new compensation package for Elon Musk, aimed at retaining him, and it's potentially worth $1 trillion. Ellison's record-breaking surge is part of the story of how AI infrastructure has become the new gold rush in tech, with Oracle positioning itself as the critical picks-and-shovels provider for companies racing to build their AI systems. His $100+ billion single-day gain—driven by Oracle's $455 billion in future cloud contracts—shows that the real money in AI may not be in building chatbots or autonomous vehicles, but in providing the computing backbone these technologies require.

Share this article The Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed approval of staking capabilities for BlackRock’s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund. The regulatory agency has not provided a timeline for when staking features might be approved for the ETF. BlackRock had sought to include staking functionality, which would allow the fund to earn additional returns by participating in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake validation process. Staking involves locking up Ethereum tokens to help secure the network and validate transactions, typically generating annual yields for participants. The decision affects one of the largest asset managers’ efforts to offer comprehensive Ethereum exposure through a regulated investment vehicle. BlackRock manages approximately $10 trillion in assets globally. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

Title: Top Asset Managers Drop Support for Left-Wing Corporate Activism

His work has been published in The Epoch Times, The Federalist, The Daily Signal and The American Conservative. Previously, he worked more than a decade on Wall Street. A decade-long effort to leverage asset managers to impose net-zero and social justice policies on corporations has gone into reverse with reports from this year’s corporate voting season that the most influential fund managers are no longer voting for these policies. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with more than $11 trillion in assets under management, reported that it voted against 98% of the environmental and social shareholder proposals in 2025, up from 96% against in 2024. Vanguard, the world’s second-largest fund manager with more than $10 trillion in assets, did not vote in favor of a single environmental or social proposal. State Street Investment Management, the third largest with more than $5 trillion under management, has not yet released its 2025 proxy voting report. These three fund managers, often called the “Big Three,” together represent about 25% of the votes cast at annual meetings of S&P 500 companies, a 2022 report by Harvard law professor Lucian A. Bebchuk and Boston University law professor Scott Hirst states. The vast majority of U.S. corporate shares are owned by institutional investors such as asset managers, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, banks, and insurance companies. These institutions owned 78% of the companies in the Russell 3000 index and 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 index, according to a 2017 study by Pensions & Investments. When individuals buy into investment funds, the fund typically owns the companies’ shares and the voting rights that come with them. And many fund managers have in turn voted for environmental and social agendas, according to an analysis by Lindsey Stewart, an investment analyst at Morningstar Inc. In 2020, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative was formed and grew to 330 members, which until recently included the Big Three, pledging to leverage their influence as shareholders to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As a sign of changing times, however, Vanguard quit the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in 2022, and BlackRock exited this past January, prompting the club to halt operations soon thereafter. Proxy voting has moved in a similar direction. “The Big Three have indeed effectively ended their support for [environmental, social, and governance] proposals in just a few short years,” Tim Schwarzenberger, portfolio manager for Inspire Investing, told The Daily Signal. “The legal landscape and public perception have shifted quickly, and these major players are now catching up, which is a major victory for common sense,” he said. “Most Americans and shareholders do not want corporations engaged in politics.” In addition, red state attorneys general have recently threatened legal action for alleged violations of antitrust laws, and state treasurers have threatened boycotts of left-wing fund managers. Pressure has also come from conservative shareholders, and this, combined with a Trump administration that opposes climate and social-justice agendas, has taken a toll on corporate activism. “Vanguard and BlackRock have skated where the puck has gone, and should be commended for it,” David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, said of this year’s proxy votes. “Investors want investment strategies connected to return on their capital—they do not want the intrusion of a poorly-defined social agenda. “That 2019-2022 experiment has ended, and the verdict was clear,” he told The Daily Signal. Some asset managers also faced charges that political goals diverted them from their fiduciary duties to maximize investor returns. Whether or not this was the case, current rhetoric indicates a focus on shareholder value this voting season. In its 2025 proxy voting report, BlackRock stated that many of the environmental and social proposals it rejected “were overreaching, lacked economic merit, or sought outcomes that were unlikely to promote long-term financial value.” Vanguard likewise stated that it rejected proposals that “did not address financially material risks to shareholders.” Conservatives lauded this approach but say they remain vigilant. “Vanguard’s apparent return to sanity and their fiduciary duty to their clients is welcome news,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Daily Signal. “While there are many other ways that asset managers wield influence over corporations, support for extremist, left-wing activist shareholder proposals has been one of the most noxious.” Vanguard’s report referenced the “voluntary withdrawal of proposals by proponents, often following reported engagement with the company.” Conservatives say that in many cases, corporate management settles with activists prior to the vote, in return for having the proposal dropped. Advocates for corporate activism say it is prudent risk management and that companies that pursue climate and social goals will be more profitable. Critics counter that those issues should be left to voters. “Issues of climate policy and social justice should be addressed primarily at the election ballot box, not through corporate activism that is at odds with the values of many Americans,” Schwarzenberger said. “And in truth, most [Environmental, Social, and Governance] risks are already captured in stock prices, so symbolic shareholder votes add little value.” The Daily Signal reached out to BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street for comment.

Title: Top Asset Managers Drop Support for Left-Wing Corporate Activism

His work has been published in The Epoch Times, The Federalist, The Daily Signal and The American Conservative. Previously, he worked more than a decade on Wall Street. A decade-long effort to leverage asset managers to impose net-zero and social justice policies on corporations has gone into reverse with reports from this year’s corporate voting season that the most influential fund managers are no longer voting for these policies. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with more than $11 trillion in assets under management, reported that it voted against 98% of the environmental and social shareholder proposals in 2025, up from 96% against in 2024. Vanguard, the world’s second-largest fund manager with more than $10 trillion in assets, did not vote in favor of a single environmental or social proposal. State Street Investment Management, the third largest with more than $5 trillion under management, has not yet released its 2025 proxy voting report. These three fund managers, often called the “Big Three,” together represent about 25% of the votes cast at annual meetings of S&P 500 companies, a 2022 report by Harvard law professor Lucian A. Bebchuk and Boston University law professor Scott Hirst states. The vast majority of U.S. corporate shares are owned by institutional investors such as asset managers, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, banks, and insurance companies. These institutions owned 78% of the companies in the Russell 3000 index and 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 index, according to a 2017 study by Pensions & Investments. When individuals buy into investment funds, the fund typically owns the companies’ shares and the voting rights that come with them. And many fund managers have in turn voted for environmental and social agendas, according to an analysis by Lindsey Stewart, an investment analyst at Morningstar Inc. In 2020, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative was formed and grew to 330 members, which until recently included the Big Three, pledging to leverage their influence as shareholders to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As a sign of changing times, however, Vanguard quit the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in 2022, and BlackRock exited this past January, prompting the club to halt operations soon thereafter. Proxy voting has moved in a similar direction. “The Big Three have indeed effectively ended their support for [environmental, social, and governance] proposals in just a few short years,” Tim Schwarzenberger, portfolio manager for Inspire Investing, told The Daily Signal. “The legal landscape and public perception have shifted quickly, and these major players are now catching up, which is a major victory for common sense,” he said. “Most Americans and shareholders do not want corporations engaged in politics.” In addition, red state attorneys general have recently threatened legal action for alleged violations of antitrust laws, and state treasurers have threatened boycotts of left-wing fund managers. Pressure has also come from conservative shareholders, and this, combined with a Trump administration that opposes climate and social-justice agendas, has taken a toll on corporate activism. “Vanguard and BlackRock have skated where the puck has gone, and should be commended for it,” David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, said of this year’s proxy votes. “Investors want investment strategies connected to return on their capital—they do not want the intrusion of a poorly-defined social agenda. “That 2019-2022 experiment has ended, and the verdict was clear,” he told The Daily Signal. Some asset managers also faced charges that political goals diverted them from their fiduciary duties to maximize investor returns. Whether or not this was the case, current rhetoric indicates a focus on shareholder value this voting season. In its 2025 proxy voting report, BlackRock stated that many of the environmental and social proposals it rejected “were overreaching, lacked economic merit, or sought outcomes that were unlikely to promote long-term financial value.” Vanguard likewise stated that it rejected proposals that “did not address financially material risks to shareholders.” Conservatives lauded this approach but say they remain vigilant. “Vanguard’s apparent return to sanity and their fiduciary duty to their clients is welcome news,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Daily Signal. “While there are many other ways that asset managers wield influence over corporations, support for extremist, left-wing activist shareholder proposals has been one of the most noxious.” Vanguard’s report referenced the “voluntary withdrawal of proposals by proponents, often following reported engagement with the company.” Conservatives say that in many cases, corporate management settles with activists prior to the vote, in return for having the proposal dropped.

Title: Quantum computing startup PsiQuantum raises $1B, aiming to build 1M qubit-scale machine
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/09/10/quantum-computing-startup-psiquantum-raises-1b-aiming-build-1m-qubit-scale-machine/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T16:50:56Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 12:50 EDT / SEPTEMBER 10 2025 by Kyt Dotson PsiQuantum Inc., a well-funded quantum computing startup, said today it has raised $1 billion in late-stage funding to accelerate its efforts to build a large-scale, reliable quantum computer with more than a million qubits. The Series E deal was led by BlackRock Inc., alongside Temasek and Baillie Gifford. The fundraise brings the valuation of the company to $7 billion, more than doubling the company’s valuation since its $450 million Series D in 2021. The round brought on more than a half-dozen new investors, including Macquarie Capital, Ribbit Capital, Nvidia Corp.’s venture arm NVentures andAdage Capital Management, with participation from existing investors that include Blackbird, Third Point Ventures and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Quantum computers at any scale require error correction and at a scale as large as 1 million qubits, doing so will become a challenging proposition. Qubits are the quantum equivalent of bits in classical computers. Qubits are used to perform calculations similar to traditional computing; however, they possess properties that allow them to represent both a 1 and a 0 simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to perform extremely complex calculations faster than the largest supercomputers currently available. “Only building the real thing — million-qubit-scale, fault-tolerant machines — will unlock the promise of quantum computing,” said Prof. Jeremy O’Brien, PsiQuantum’s co-founder and chief executive. “We defined what it takes from day one: this is a grand engineering challenge, not a science experiment.” To meet practical demands, quantum computing firms have been pushing machines to larger and larger sizes. Although only suited for very specific computations, quantum computers have shown promise for solving problems in drug discovery, genetics and materials science. When combined with supercomputers in hybrid systems, quantum computers can solve problems in minutes that would take a traditional system months or years. Since 2021, PsiQuantum has scaled its manufacturing process for its integrated photonic chipset, which uses light for storage and communications within the quantum computer. Additionally, the company has incorporated Barium Titanate into its manufacturing process; this is ideal for ultra-high-performance optical switches, which the company states are the missing component for scaling its machines. The company said the funds will help it build its ambitious quantum machine by 2028. PsiQuantum is not the only quantum outfit with plans to build large-scale machines before the end of the decade. IBM Corp. revealed a roadmap with plans for IBM Quantum Starling, a quantum computer capable of performing 20,000 times more operations than today’s machines. The investment comes shortly after rival Quantinuum raised $600 million at a $10 billion valuation this month and Google LLC unveiled Willow, its largest error-correcting quantum computing chip, at the end of 2024. Along with the funding, the company announced a collaboration with Nvidia that will cover the development of quantum algorithms and software, and the integration of graphics processing units with quantum computing chips using its infrastructure. GPUs are a fundamental technology used for the training, deployment and computational acceleration of artificial intelligence models. “AI is built on classical computing, which has underpinned the last fifty years of technology,” said Tony Kim, head of the Fundamental Equities Technology Group at BlackRock. “Now, we are at the dawn of an adjacent computing platform — rooted in quantum mechanics — that will allow us to simulate the physical world with transformative accuracy.” PsiQuantum also develops the cooling, networking and control systems for utility-scale quantum computers. By harnessing light for networking and control, the company said its systems don’t depend on the now iconic-looking “chandelier”-style cryostats often used to chill quantum computers. Using its specialized technology, the company designed a new high-density cooling solution that can be slotted into modular racks at data centers, capable of cooling hundreds of chips in a single cabinet.

Title: Gemini's Raised IPO Range Indicates Strong Demand for New Crypto Stocks
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/gemini-s-raised-ipo-range-indicates-strong-demand-for-new-crypto-stocks-11807087
Time Published: 2025-09-10T15:38:31Z
Full Content:
The crypto exchange founded by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss looks poised to be the next hot crypto IPO. Gemini Space Station on Wednesday raised the range at which it expects its initial public offering to $24 to $26; it still plans to offer some 16.7 million shares, indicating a market capitalization over $3 billion at the high end. The boosted price suggests strong demand from investors for the shares and follows a string of successful public debuts that includes industry peers like stablecoin operator Circle (CRCL) and institution-focused digital assets platform Bullish (BLSH). The original range was estimated at $17 to $19 per share. Gemini Space Station is expected to list on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol "GEMI." Earlier this week, Gemini secured a $50 million private investment from another exchange operator, Nasdaq (NDAQ), a regulatory filling shows. Nasdaq agreed to pay a per share price equal to the IPO for Class A stock, less underwriting costs and commissions. The Winklevoss twins, famous for their role in the social media network once called Facebook, now known as Meta (META), are also earmarking a set of shares for retail investors. The company expects as much as 30% of Class A shares will be offered to individual investors via brokerages including Robinhood (HOOD) and SoFi (SOFI). Gemini operates one of the better-known crypto exchanges in the U.S. and also has a credit card business. While its trading volume is a fraction of the much larger Coinbase Global (COIN), the company said tokenization and card payments represent "immense untapped potential" for its future growth.

Title: If the AI Industry Fails, It Could Take the Rest of Us Down With It
URL: https://futurism.com/ai-economy-industry-hype
Time Published: 2025-09-10T15:12:33Z
Full Content:
Don't let AI critics tell you it's good for nothing: the amount of money being spent on AI infrastructure is so enormous that it’s literally propping up the US economy. The drawback, of course, is that if the AI industry fails, it could drag the rest of the economy down with it. In 2024, the S&P 500 grew by an incredible 24 percent — what the investment firm Charles Schwab understatedly called a "very good year." Since 2023, nearly half the growth was clustered in just a handful of tech stocks known as the "magnificent seven": Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, and Apple. And as the Atlantic recently noted, the companies most heavily involved in the AI boom have yet to see that success manifest in anywhere except the stock market. Though Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Tesla are expected to have spent some $560 billion on AI development by the beginning of next year, their collective revenue from AI comes in at a paltry $35 billion. In the first half of 2025, the Atlantic notes, business spending on AI added more to GDP growth in the United States than all consumer spending combined. This revenue gap is the key crisis facing the tech industry — and the broader economy — in their quest to build an AI future. Thanks to roundly horrible performance in actual workplace environments, revenue remains illusive for the vast majority of AI deployments. Still, managers across industries are being pressured to show financial gains from the tech, even when the software isn’t delivering. That’s causing companies to do some creative accounting with their staff, laying off workers or slowing down hiring to inflate AI’s numbers. As the Atlantic highlights, this is leading to the very real possibility of a rupture forming in the broader economy, where companies induce rounds of layoffs to satisfy executives, without anything to show for it in the bottom line. In other words, we’re barreling toward a future where unemployment could rise while productivity takes a nosedive — dramatically slowing the economy as a result. That scenario isn’t exactly unprecedented. The computer boom of the 1980s took a similar turn, when early email software prompted executives to lay off secretaries and typists, resulting in specialized white collar workers actually spending more time sending emails than on their typical roles. "Email was one of those technologies that made us feel more productive but actually did the opposite," computer scientist Cal Newport told the Atlantic. "I worry we may be headed down the same path with AI." There’s just one crucial difference: email isn’t propping up half the stock market.

Title: Novo Nordisk Cuts Around 9,000 Jobs as Weight-Loss Drugmaker Faces Growing Competition

Novo Nordisk (NVO) is making big job cuts as the weight-loss drugmaker faces growing competition. The pharmaceutical firm said it is slashing about 9,000 positions or 11.5% of its workforce. 5,000 of the cuts will be made in its home country of Denmark. The company said the layoffs are part of a “transformation” designed to simplify Novo Nordisk’s organization, speed up decision-making, and shift resources to help grow its diabetes and obesity business medicines. CEO Mike Doustdar said, “our markets are evolving, particularly in obesity, as it has become more competitive and consumer-driven.” He added the company “must evolve as well,” which means instilling “an increased performance-based culture, deploying our resources ever more effectively, and prioritizing investment where it will have the most impact—behind our leading therapy areas.” Novo Nordisk said it expects the headcount drop will result in annualized savings of about 8 billion Danish Krone ($1.25 billion) by the end of 2026. However, it also anticipates the cuts will result in a restructuring cost of 8 billion Danish Krone this year, and is now projecting operating profit will grow 4% to 10%, down from a forecast of 10% to 16% previously. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk were up about 2% in recent trading. They've lost about a third of their value this year, as rivals such as Eli Lilly (LLY) have expanded their market share in diabetes and weight-loss treatments.

Business FILE PHOTO: A specialist trader works at the post where BlackRock is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., July 21, 2022. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo DUBAI : A group of investors led by BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners is in talks with lenders to secure up to $10.3 billion in financing for Aramco's Jafurah infrastructure deal, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Banks including JPMorgan and Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation are in talks to participate in the transaction, the two sources said, which will allow Aramco to raise cash upfront in return for steady payments over time. The debt financing will be split into two parts, a short-term and a long-term loan, said the people, declining to be named because the matter is not public. Aramco, BlackRock, JPM and SMBC declined to comment. Under the deal, a newly formed subsidiary, Jafurah Midstream Gas Company (JMGC), will lease development and usage rights for gas processing facilities around the Jafurah gas development and lease them back to Aramco for 20 years.

It drew more than $16.5 billion in orders on Wednesday for the sukuk, expected to price later in the day.The deal also reflects Saudi Arabia's broader energy strategy. By displacing crude oil in domestic power generation, more barrels will be available to export, as feedstock for petrochemicals, and to power emerging sectors such as artificial intelligence data centres.The GIP consortium is injecting about $1.8 billion of their own funds into the transaction, the two sources said.Roughly three-quarters of the debt financing will have a seven-year tenor - and could be refinanced via bonds - and the rest will be due in 19 years, one of the sources said. Chinese banks have shown interest in helping to finance the short tenor, the source added. Goldman Sachs, Citi, Mizuho and MUFG have also signalled interest in participating in the financing, a third source told Reuters.

The Jafurah field, estimated to contain 229 trillion standard cubic feet of raw gas, is the largest non-associated gas development in Saudi Arabia and a cornerstone of Aramco's plan to boost gas output by 60 per cent by 2030 from 2021 levels.

Title: JPMorgan Chase’s Profit Engine That Remains Undervalued
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/10/jpmorgan-chases-profit-engine-that-remains-undervalued/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T13:57:41Z

ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. Markets surged to fresh record highs recently on the back of July’s consumer inflation reading. The data increased expectations for a rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s September meeting. Trade sentiment also improved after President Trump extended the U.S.–China tariff truce for an additional 90 days. While the tone in markets this week has been broadly optimistic, valuations remain elevated. The S&P 500 trades at valuation levels not seen since the dot-com crash. Identifying stocks that combine strong fundamentals with cheap valuations should remain a priority for diligent investors. My firm’s AI Agent is designed to screen for such opportunities by leveraging proven-superior data to produce more precise, transparent, and reliable signals. The outperformance of the “Very Attractive Stocks Index”, which holds the stocks in the Bloomberg 1000 Index that get a Very Attractive Rating, is proof of the alpha the AI Agent produces in the market. My Long Idea this week highlights a company with industry leading-profitability, revenue growth across all business segments, record profits, and a cheap stock price. I originally made JPMorgan Chase (JPM: $293/share) a Long Idea in May 2020 and most recently reiterated my position on the stock in November 2024. JPMorgan Chase recently beat both top- and bottom-line estimates in 2Q25, and now that the company has filed its latest 10-Q, I find that the stock still presents Very Attractive risk/reward. JPMorgan Chase reported strong results across its business in 2Q25. The company’s firmwide average loans and deposits were up 5% and 6% year-over-year (YoY), respectively. More specifically, JPMorgan Chase reported quality growth across all three business segments, including: These results continue a trend of long-term fundamental strength for the largest bank in the United States. JPMorgan Chase’s revenue composition reflects a strategically balanced model, with total net revenue split nearly evenly between net interest income (NII) and noninterest revenue (NIR). This diversification mitigates earnings volatility tied to interest rate fluctuations and reinforces the firm’s resilience across market cycles. Notably, JPMorgan Chase has demonstrated consistent growth in both revenue streams over the past decade. The company grew NII from $43.6 billion in 2014 to $93.2 billion in the TTM ended 2Q25, which represents compound annual growth of 7%. JPMorgan Chase grew its NIR from $50.6 billion to $82.4 billion over the same time, or 5% compounded annually. See Figure 1. Figure 1: JPMorgan Chase’s NII and NIR: 2014 – TTM JPMorgan Chase leverages its diversified business model to continually grow its top- and bottom-line. JPMorgan Chase has grown revenue and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 10% and 11% compounded annually since 2014. See Figure 2. In each of the past three fiscal years, and the TTM ended 2Q25, the company’s NOPAT reached record highs. The company improved its NOPAT margin from 21% in 2014 to 23% in the TTM while invested capital turns rose from 0.4 to 0.7 over the same time. Rising NOPAT margins and invested capital turns drive the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) from 8% in 2014 to 16% in the TTM ended 2Q25. Additionally, the company’s Core Earnings, a superior and cleaner earnings measure, grew 10% compounded annually from $22.2 billion in 2014 to $60.6 billion in the TTM. Figure 2: JPMorgan Chase’s Revenue and NOPAT Since 2014 JPMorgan Chase has not only grown revenue and profits to record levels, but it has done so while maintaining industry leading margins and ROIC. As I mentioned earlier in the report, the company has improved both its operational efficiency (NOPAT margin) and its balance sheet efficiency (invested capital turns) over the last decade. Per Figure 3, JPMorgan Chase has the highest NOPAT margin and ROIC among peers which include, Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Figure 3: JPMorgan Chase’s Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM Due to its superior capitalization, JPMorgan Chase maintains a stronger financial position than its peers, too. At the end of 2Q25, JPMorgan Chase’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio (CET1), the equity portion of its Tier 1 Capital, was 15.1%, which is up from 12.4% at the of 2019 and 10.2% in 2014. Importantly, JPMorgan Chase’s CET1 ratio is well above the 4.5% minimum required by the Federal Reserve. Additionally, the company’s Tier 1 Capital ratio, which measures a bank’s core equity capital to its total risk-weighted assets is 16.1% through the 2Q25, which is up from 14.1% in 2019 and 11.6% in 2014. Once again, JPMorgan Chase’s Tier 1 Capital ratio is well above the 6.0% minimum required by the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase’s Tier 1 Capital and CET 1 ratios have been trending higher for over a decade. See Figure 4. Figure 4: Tier 1 Capital and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios: 2010 – 2Q25 Per Figure 5, JPMorgan Chase’s CET1 ratio ranks above big bank peers mentioned earlier in the report. The company’s Tier 1 Capital ratio is higher than all listed peers except Morgan Stanley (MS). Figure 5: JPMorgan Chase’s Capital Ratios Vs. Peers – 2Q25 JPMorgan Chase has paid $87.7 billion (11% of market cap) in dividends since 2019 and increased its quarterly dividend from $0.80/share in 2Q19 to $1.40/share in 2Q25. The company’s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 1.9% yield. JPMorgan Chase also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Since 2019, JPMorgan Chase repurchased $95.9 billion (12% of market cap) shares. During the first six months of 2025, the company repurchased $15.1 billion shares. In July 2025, JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program of $50 billion. Should the company repurchase shares at the TTM pace, it would repurchase $25.7 billion of shares over the next 12 months, which is 3.2% of the company’s current market cap. When combined, the dividend and share repurchase yield could reach 5.1%. Investors should take comfort in knowing JPMorgan Chase will be able to afford to pay its dividends and repurchase shares due to its large free cash flow (FCF) generation. From 2019 through 1H25, JPMorgan Chase generated $201.2 billion in FCF, which equals 25% of the company’s enterprise value. Figure 6: JPMorgan Chase’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow: 2019 – 1H25 JPMorgan Chase’s $201.2 billion in FCF since 2019 is more than enough to cover its $183.6 billion in combined dividend payments ($87.7 billion) and share repurchases ($95.9 billion). JPMorgan Chase’s repurchases have also meaningfully reduced its shares outstanding from 3.1 billion in 2019 to 2.7 billion in 2Q25. See Figure 7. I like companies that choose to return capital to shareholders instead of spending it on costly acquisitions or executive bonuses that rarely drive shareholder value creation. Companies that sport strong enough cash flows to consistently lower their shares outstanding offer excellent value. Figure 7: JPMorgan Chase’s Shares Outstanding: 2019 – 2Q25 Expectations for a rate cut in September are on the rise, in part due to the latest CPI data and comments from Fed officials. Fed governor Bowman aims for three interest rate cuts in the remainder of 2025. An interest rate cut would put pressure on all banks’, JPMorgan Chase included, net interest margin (NIM) and in turn their NII. In its 2Q25 10-Q, JPMorgan Chase disclosed its earnings-at-risk sensitivity depending on different movement in rates. In this analysis, JPMorgan Chase determined that a 100-basis point interest rate decline results in a $2 billion decrease in earnings. Similarly, a 200-basis point interest rate decline results in a nearly $5 billion decrease in earnings. The good news? This exposure to lower rates is down from the company’s sensitivity in December 2024, which coincides with rising expectations for a rate cut. JPMorgan Chase maintains the best capital ratios in the industry and is best positioned to grow noninterest revenue throughout all cycles. Additionally, any pressure on profits is already more than priced into JPMorgan Chase’s current stock price, as I’ll show below. At its current price of $293/share, JPMorgan Chase has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 1.0. This ratio means the market expects the company’s profits to never grow from TTM ended 2Q25 levels. For reference, JPMorgan Chase has grown NOPAT 11% compounded annually over the last five, ten, and 26 (longest period in my model) years. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to quantify the cash flow expectations for different stock price scenarios for JPM. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: the stock would be worth $293/share today – equal to the current stock price. In this scenario, JPMorgan Chase’s NOPAT would grow just 2% compounded annually from 2025 – 2034, which is well below the company’s historical NOPAT growth rates. If I instead assume: the stock would be worth $377/share today – a 29% upside to the current price. In this scenario, JPMorgan Chase’s NOPAT would grow 5% compounded annually through fiscal 2034, which would still be below the company’s NOPAT compound annual growth rates over the past 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year periods. Should NOPAT grow closer to historical rates, the upside would be even larger. Figure 8 compares JPMorgan Chase’s historical NOPAT to the NOPAT implied in each of the above scenarios.

If I instead assume: the stock would be worth $377/share today – a 29% upside to the current price. In this scenario, JPMorgan Chase’s NOPAT would grow 5% compounded annually through fiscal 2034, which would still be below the company’s NOPAT compound annual growth rates over the past 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year periods. Should NOPAT grow closer to historical rates, the upside would be even larger. Figure 8 compares JPMorgan Chase’s historical NOPAT to the NOPAT implied in each of the above scenarios.

Klarna may be celebrating its IPO and $15 billion valuation, but employees seem focused on another matter: return-to-office plans. Klarna informed employees last week that it's set to roll out a return-to-office policy later this month, citing the need to retain top talent that might otherwise leave for companies prioritizing in-person work, as Business Insider exclusively reported. Staff have reacted to the announcement with a wide range of emoji responses, according to a Slack post shared in a channel with roughly 3,000 workers and seen by Business Insider. Comments on the post were disabled, so employees expressed their reactions solely through emojis, which appear to signal strong disapproval of the plans. The responses were varied and, at times, humorous: 341 employees reacted with a sad face emoji, 167 used an emoji reading "no," 149 chose a sweat-faced sad emoji. Additional responses included 41 "this sucks" emojis, and 43 using an emoji based on the viral "Hide the Pain Harold" meme. A small proportion appeared to signal approval of the plans, including 19 thumbs-up emojis and 14 rocket ship emojis. Other popular reactions included 131 sad cat emojis, 90 facepalm emojis, 86 crying emojis, and 73 clown face emojis. Some employees went for more whimsical options: 62 selected the "Homer Simpson backing into a bush" emoji, and 17 used a child going down a slide saying "bye" emoji. Klarna declined to comment. Other tech companies, including Amazon, Dell, and Meta, have implemented RTO policies in recent years. The Swedish fintech said on Tuesday that it set its IPO price at $40 a share as it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Samuel Kerr, head of equity capital markets at Mergermarket, said the IPO's pricing is a "tremendous" result for Klarna and its shareholders. He said that all eyes would be on Klarna once trading begins, given the early volatility around recent IPOs. Investors, he said, will closely scrutinize the company's financials, particularly in light of recent losses. Klarna has seen double-digit growth in its users and gross merchandise value, but achieving profitability continues to be a challenge. Losses for the quarter ended June 30 surged to $52 million, up from $7 million a year earlier, even as revenue climbed to $823 million from $682 million. "That scrutiny and Klarna's answers on its evolution and growth could be the determiner of IPO success, as it's hard to draw too much of a parallel between broader fintech listings," Kerr said. In an F-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Klarna disclosed that it has partnered with and paid over $16 million to climate impact nonprofits founded by the wife of its CEO over the past five years.Have a tip?

Title: Apple's new ultra-thin iPhone has some people excited, but Wall Street doesn't seem convinced

Hiya! Got a ton of boring meetings on the docket today? A former Google and Stripe executive has some tips for keeping people engaged. (Hint: Do some prep work.) In today's big story, it was the biggest day of the year for Apple. We break down all the major product announcements and make the case for why the iPhone Air is actually pretty cool. What's on deck: Markets: The stock market is turning into a ticking time bomb, and the growing mountain of rough economic data is the trigger. Tech: It's back to the office for Microsoft workers. And the AI team isn't getting a pass. Business: A first-hand account of buying an apartment in NYC as a Gen Zer. (Yes, it's possible!) But first, Air Apple. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's an iPhone, just make it thinner. The star of Apple's big, annual product reveal was the iPhone Air, a slimmed-down version of the popular smartphone. At a whopping 5.6 millimeters — that's less than a quarter-inch for metric system haters — Apple said the iPhone Air is thin enough to fit on a fingertip. The iPhone Air's smaller size comes with a few sacrifices. Its camera, internal chip, and battery are all a bit of a step down from its bigger siblings. And at $999, it's more than a base model iPhone, making it no bargain. However, Apple says it's making the most of its size, calling it "the most power-efficient iPhone we've ever made" and touting its durability. It might not be the groundbreaking announcement you were hoping for, but iPhone launches rarely are these days. A slightly improved camera here. A moderately better chip there. That's part of the reason why iPhone users hold onto their phones for a lot longer than Apple would like. Apple's big AI push last year was meant to encourage users to finally upgrade their phones, but Apple Intelligence mostly fell flat. So, if you can't attract them with the software, pitch them on the hardware! And the iPhone Air, if nothing else, is pretty impressive to look at. It also appears to have at least one convert. BI's Katie Notopoulos is very excited about the iPhone Air. She explained why the slimmed-down iPhone is exactly what she's been looking for. Still, arguably the toughest and most important critic wasn't impressed. Apple's stock finished the day down almost 1.5%. It wasn't just about the iPhone Air. BI's Sarah Jackson broke down all the big product announcements from Apple. Here are some of the highlights: The other iPhones: The iPhone 17 Pro's camera is comparable to eight professional lenses. It'll cost you at least $1,099, which is $100 more than the iPhone 16 Pro's starting price, but it has more storage (256 GB instead of 128 GB). If you're really trying to ball out, the iPhone 17 Pro Max starts at $1,199. Meanwhile, the entry-level iPhone 17 price of $799 is the same as last year. AirPods Pro 3: The big news here is a heart rate sensor for the gym bros/gals. That could serve as a bridge into more health-related products from Apple. There's also a Live Translation feature powered by Apple Intelligence. The new buds start at $249. Apple Watch: The biggest upgrades are battery life, a scratch-resistant screen, and a better display. The Ultra 3 ($799) can last up to 42 hours on a full charge, while the Series 11 ($399) and SE 3 ($249) will last 24 and 18 hours, respectively. 1. The labor market is a lot cooler than we thought — and not in a good way. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 911,000 fewer non-farm jobs were added from April 2024 to March 2025 than previously reported. Most major industry sectors, including leisure and hospitality, saw large downward revisions. 2. How long can stock investors keep ignoring bad economic data? The latest revision to the labor market (see above) wasn't good, and inflation is still a concern. Yet the stock market is already fully valued, and major indexes are sitting at record highs. Once investors flip their stance on the economic data, watch out, BI's Joe Ciolli writes. 3. Citi poaches a longtime IBM executive to pursue its AI ambitions. Shobhit Varshney, the firm's new head of AI, will report to Citi's chief operating officer and work closely with its chief technology officer, according to a memo sent to staff and seen by BI. About 175,000 employees already have access to Citi's AI tools. 1. One of Big Tech's last RTO holdouts is calling workers back to the office. Microsoft employees will be required to go in three days a week, according to an internal email sent to staff and seen by BI. The mandate will happen in three phases, starting at the end of February 2026. And if you're one of Microsoft's AI stars, the RTO guidelines are even stricter. 2. One step closer to mind control? The Pentagon just partnered with Phantom Neuro, a startup that wants to let users control prosthetic limbs with muscle memory. The startup received roughly $300,000 from the DOD's emerging tech group and raised $19 million Series A in April. 3. Verily is restructuring in anticipation of new investors. In a recent town hall meeting, CEO Stephen Gillett told staff that Verily is transforming to a C-corp business structure as it seeks a fresh round of investment. Employees were also told their stock was being revalued, dropping around 80% compared to their 2024 value, according to internal documents viewed by BI. 1. It's giving homeowner. BI reporter and "geriatric Gen Zer" Juliana Kaplan recently bought an apartment in New York City at 28 years old. With a little bit of smart saving and luck, here's how she did it. 2. Whoop's CEO believes in work-life harmony, not work-life balance. The difference is flexibility, the fitness-tech CEO explained in the latest installment of BI's Power Hours. He shared his daily routine, from early morning workouts to cold plunges and meditation. 3. Four-day RTO vs. eight weeks of severance. That's the balance some NBCUniversal employees are weighing in the wake of a return-to-office order set to begin January 5. Unusually, the offer isn't based on employee tenure — everyone gets eight weeks regardless of how long they've been there. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom’s stock surged 13% over the past week, following strong earnings, optimistic guidance, and a significant new order for $10 billion in custom AI chips. The key question for investors now is whether the stock is a buy at its current price of $360. We believe there is not much to fear in AVGO stock, given its overall very strong operating performance and financial condition. Therefore, despite its very high valuation, the stock appears attractive. Here is our multi-factor assessment. Separately, also look at our take on potential 2x upside for AVGO stock. Still, no matter how attractive, investing in a single stock carries high risk. Trefis High Quality Portfolio is designed to reduce stock-specific risk while giving upside exposure. Let's get into details of each of the assessed factors, but before that, a quick background: With $1.6 Tril in market cap, Broadcom provides semiconductor devices and software solutions, including set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking products across semiconductor and infrastructure software segments. This table highlights how AVGO is valued vs the broader market. For more details, see: AVGO Valuation Ratios This table highlights how AVGO is growing vs the broader market. For more details see: AVGO Revenue Comparison This table highlights how AVGO’s profitability compares with the broader market. For more details, see: AVGO Operating Income Comparison AVGO saw an impact slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We assess this based on both (a) how much the stock fell and (b) how quickly it recovered. But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are good—think events like earnings, business updates, or outlook changes. Read AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index—less of a roller-coaster ride—as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Rigetti Computing: How RGTI Stock Falls To $2?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/10/rigetti-computing-how-rgti-stock-falls-to-2/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T13:25:00Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rigetti Computing's stock has soared 2,000% over the past year. Why? It’s been a perfect storm of catalysts. There’s been intense hype around quantum computing and significant capital flowing into the space, which energized investor sentiment. Add the massive AI boom, and many market participants began grouping quantum names like Rigetti into that broader narrative. With only a handful of publicly traded quantum companies, RGTI became a scarce—and therefore hot—stock to own. On top of that, large institutional investors started building positions, lending further credibility. The result was powerful momentum, with retail investors piling in for fear of missing out and pushing the price even higher. Here’s the catch: quantum may be the future, but widespread commercial adoption is still years away. Today’s use cases are limited, with most work concentrated on simulating chemistry and physics. Look at RGTI's fundamentals: We agree, quantum stocks hinge on future growth—and we’ve already explored the upside potential. But have you weighed the downside risks? We cover them below. That said, if you want upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – Oracle Stock To $900. Markets don’t trend in one direction forever—as we’ve seen recently—and quantum computing remains years from broad commercialization. There are several risks that could derail Rigetti’s growth narrative. When sentiment sours, speculative stocks don’t just dip—they get hammered. This isn’t theoretical. In 2022, high inflation spurred rate hikes, and the market fell roughly 25% from its peak. Do you know how much RGTI sank? It was a whopping 96% decline from $9 to $0.40. What could trigger the next collapse? What’s the realistic downside for RGTI from around $16? If history rhymes, it’s under $2. Are you ready for that? The 2022 slide wiped out 96% of RGTI’s value. Even a “moderate” 75–80% correction implies $3–4. Given the speculative setup and weak fundamentals, a return to sub-$2 isn’t just possible—it has precedent. This analysis isn’t bearish for its own sake; it’s about recognizing risk. The probability may be uncertain, but the magnitude is high, and anyone holding RGTI should be prepared for potentially severe drawdowns. For investors seeking growth exposure without the extreme swings of speculative single names, consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 indices) to deliver strong returns. Why? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks adapts to strong markets while limiting downside when conditions deteriorate, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics. Remember: in speculative growth stocks, the same momentum that fuels spectacular gains can drive equally spectacular losses. The question isn’t whether RGTI will be volatile—it’s whether you can withstand what the downside might look like.

Title: Consumer Gasoline Costs Lowest In 20 Years: EIA
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2025/09/10/consumer-gasoline-costs-lowest-in-20-years-eia/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T13:19:21Z

ByDavid Blackmon, Senior Contributor. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports in its September Short Term Energy Outlook that this year’s cost of gasoline for U.S. drivers is the lowest since at least 2005 as a share of disposable income. That bit of good news for consumers and the Trump White House is but one of a wealth of interesting data points contained in this latest EIA report. As is pretty much always the case, this year’s drop in the price for gas at the pump has trended in step with a similar downturn in crude oil prices. After reaching a January high of almost $79 per barrel, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) index price has dropped by over 20% to its current level of roughly $63/bbl. Wholesale gas prices have shown a similar drop from an early February peak of about $2.38 per gallon, falling to $1.99/gallon as of this writing. Diesel fuel prices have followed a similar path since January. That’s another bit of positive news for consumer prices since basically all food, clothing and other consumer goods are transported from factories to market via ships, planes, trucks, and trains which run on some variant of Diesel fuel. More good consumer news comes in the EIA’s projection that further reductions in energy prices remain ahead in the months to come. “We expect the Brent crude oil price will decline significantly in the coming months, falling from $68 per barrel (b) in August to $59/b on average in the fourth quarter of 2025 (4Q25) and around $50/b in early 2026,” EIA analysts say, predicting another 25% drop in crude prices from current levels. That magnitude of additional price reductions would be supportive of President Donald Trump’s recent statement that he expects gas prices to fall into the $2/gallon range in the coming months. While the current national average retail price for regular gasoline is $3.19 according to AAA, that is inflated by much higher prices in high tax states like California, Oregon, and Illinois. Gas prices are closer to $2.70 in low price states like Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama. While low oil prices are never good news for oil-focused drilling companies, EIA says there is good news on the horizon for upstream companies looking to produce more natural gas. “We expect the Henry Hub natural gas spot price will rise from an average of $2.91 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in August to $3.70/MMBtu in 4Q25 and $4.30/MMBtu next year,” EIA analysts say, a rosy price projection that has been pretty rare across the last 16 years. Natural gas prices in the U.S. have for the most part been range-bound between $2/MMBtu and $4/MMBtu since 2009. The lone fairly long-term exception to that paradigm came in the post-COVD world in 2022-early 2023, when chronic supply chain and work force issues caused a temporary supply shortage. Otherwise, the sheer magnitude of America’s natural gas resource has enabled drillers to quickly overwhelm temporary spikes in prices by activating a number of additional drillings and driving prices back down with higher production volumes. With just 110-120 active rigs currently targeting natural gas formations, it is a safe bet that upstream companies would quickly create a similar supply response should domestic gas prices run back up past the $4/MMBtu level as EIA projects. Anticipating this enduring reality, EIA analysts say they “expect drilling activity in the United States to be more centered in natural gas-intensive producing regions in 2026.” These and other data points contained in this EIA report are consistent with the Trump White House’s goal of cutting energy costs to consumers as a major element in reducing the rate of inflation. At the same time, however, the daily news is becoming increasingly cluttered with reports of layoffs taking place in the oil and gas industry and major service companies which deliver another leg of Trump’s agenda: That of American Energy Dominance. As I pointed out here shortly after last November’s elections, it was never likely that this second Trump presidency would become a replay of the “drill, baby, drill” boom that took place during his first term in office from 2017-2021. The maturity in the development of the big U.S. shale plays, combined with strategies by the bigger corporate drillers to focus more capital resources on increased dividends and stock buyback programs would eliminate that possibility. Good news for U.S. gasoline consumers almost always means bad news for oil and gas producers. What this latest EIA Outlook illustrates as much as anything else is that inherent tension in these two major facets of the Trump energy agenda remains alive and well.

Title: S&P 500 To Crash 40%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/10/sp-500-to-crash-40/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T13:15:33Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Inflation numbers are scheduled for release on Thursday, September 11, 2025. We are concerned. Why? Back in 2022, surging prices forced the Federal Reserve into aggressive rate-hiking mode, sending the S&P 500 tumbling 25%. High flyers like Amazon lost more than 50%. Correct, $100 turning into $50 in Amazon stock. This recent history reminds us just how brutally inflation spikes can demolish market confidence. The scary part? Current market conditions mirror some of the warning signs we saw before that 2022 crash, only this time the underlying economic pressures might be even more baked in. The point is, if inflation continues its upward trend, similar to what we’ve seen in recent months, it will likely prevent Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates. When that reality hits, equity markets – especially the S&P 500 – could get hammered. And if the "sticky inflation" narrative really takes root? We could see some truly violent market reactions. Persistent, sticky inflation is what scares us. Clearly, the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the Fed view persistent, “sticky” inflation as a massive threat – and rightly so. The concern is rooted in historical precedent; look at the period from 1972 to 1974, when similar inflationary pressures contributed to an almost 50% drop in the S&P 500. In the current environment, AI, job cuts, and unemployment are top of every investor’s mind – add high inflation pressures – not 3-4%, but 7% or more, like we saw in 2022, and the Fed has no choice but to fight inflation hard with rapid and large increases. The Federal Reserve faces an additional complication not present in previous cycles: the sheer size of government debt means aggressive rate hikes could trigger a sovereign debt crisis alongside inflation concerns. This puts Powell in an impossible position – fight inflation aggressively and risk financial system stability, or remain accommodative and lose credibility on the Fed’s inflation mandate. The current inflationary environment stems from three forces – tariffs, immigration, and taxes – that have created an uncomfortable environment for the S&P 500: When you combine these three factors, it becomes more likely than not that prices will rise, creating persistent inflationary pressure. For context on how severe market downturns can become, our dashboard – How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash – captures how key stocks fared during and after the last seven market crashes, providing insight into potential recession scenarios. In such environments, positioning your portfolio is key – market timing is tricky – the High Quality (HQ) portfolio has outperformed its benchmark – a combination of S&P 500, midcap, and Russell, with >91% cumulative return since inception, and many investors choose to add downside protection to HQ. The point is simple – performance with preservation – as evident in HQ performance metrics. The fundamental reason inflation hurts equity valuations is straightforward. The value of growth assets, especially equities, is derived primarily from future cash flows that are expected to grow significantly over time. For example, cash flows for companies like Microsoft or Amazon are projected to grow by two to three times, or even more, in the next three to five years. However, if inflation remains high and the Fed maintains or even raises interest rates to combat it, those future cash flows will be discounted at a higher rate, making them worth less in today’s terms. High rates mean a dollar tomorrow is worth even less. What else? Higher interest rates attract capital away from growth-oriented and riskier assets, redirecting it toward safer investments that offer a steady yield – that 5% yield on your savings account starts looking pretty good when the markets drop 10% in a week – right? For the S&P 500, this means money flows out of stocks and into bonds, creating downward pressure on valuations. There’s more! You’ve got these automated trading systems that are programmed to react to bad news. If inflation data comes out hotter than expected, they’ll all start selling at the same time, which can trigger a flash crash. Then, there are a lot of people who just recently started investing and haven't been through a real bear market. They might get spooked and panic-sell right when things are at their worst. Finally, because many people have been using borrowed money to invest in everything from stocks to crypto, we could see a ton of forced liquidations. This could create a domino effect, sending prices tumbling across the board. See – S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%? – for the index’s performance post-Fed’s disappointments in the recent past. Many economists continue to view inflation as a significant risk to S&P 500 valuations. The risks are mounting, and the S&P 500 is vulnerable. If the inflation remains “sticky,” fundamentals won’t matter much to the investors. In fact, fundamentals take a back seat when investors get spooked by the outlook, and even great stocks can take a beating. To reduce stock-specific risk while getting exposure to upside, you could explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large, mid, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. The S&P 500 is currently at a critical juncture. If Thursday’s inflation data confirms that price pressures are persistent, the market could face significant headwinds. The combination of policy-driven inflationary forces creates a perfect storm that could derail the bull market we have grown accustomed to.

Title: Oracle Stock Up 94% On Growth Forecast. Learn Whether To Buy $ORCL

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Oracle's stock surged significantly, driven by an extremely bullish long-term forecast for its cloud infrastructure, particularly in AI, despite missing recent quarterly earnings.The company projects massive cloud revenue growth, from $18 billion in FY2026 to $144 billion by FY2030, securing major AI contracts and leveraging its database advantage for AI inference.However, risks include substantial capital expenditure, fierce competition, and the potential for reduced AI investment if businesses don't see sufficient economic returns or during an economic downturn. Oracle shares have soared 94% since the beginning of 2025 – with a more than half of that gain coming in pre-market trading today. That huge gain took place after the Austin-based tech company announced results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026 that fell short of expectations. What sent Oracle stock soaring another 49 percentage points was the company’s outlook for the future of its cloud infrastructure business, according to CNBC. Will Oracle stock keep rising? The answer depends on whether Oracle can begin to beat investor expectations and raise guidance in future quarters. I think there is more upside to the stock for two reasons: However, over the longer-term, Oracle stock may plunge if companies stop investing so heavily in artificial intelligence. That could happen unless more of them reap economic benefits – such as faster revenue growth and considerable boosts in productivity. Oracle expects rapid growth in its cloud infrastructure business. "We expect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue to grow 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year — and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the subsequent four years," CEO Safra Catz in a statement. Oracle’s results for the quarter fell flat while the company’s growth forecast generated an outpouring of enthusiasm. Here are the key numbers: The question for investors is whether Oracle’s bullish growth forecasts suggest a continued rise in its stock. Here’s the bull case: Oracle’s latest earnings report suggests growth in demand and much higher revenue driven by companies seeking to benefit from AI. Oracle’s backlog is likely to grow even more. "We signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1," Catz said in a statement. Oracle expects to contract with several additional multibillion-dollar customers and for its RPO to exceed half a trillion dollars, Catz added. "We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who’s who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, and many others," Catz said in investor call featured by Yahoo! Finance. Oracle is targeting two related AI markets – services for training large language models and for inference – generating content from a trained AI model. “Millions of customers are using those AI models to run businesses and governments,” Oracle co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison said in the investor conference call featured by the Wall Street Journal. “AI inference will be used to run robotic factories, robotic cars, robotic greenhouses, biomolecular simulations for drug designs,” he added. Oracle’s unique advantage for AI inference is its databases that store private business data. The company’s “new AI database will make it easy for those businesses to query or ask questions of their private data, all of which adds to the bill for Oracle’s AI inference services,” Ellison said, according to the Journal. Oracle is also investing in AI agents – which help people to achieve specific goals such as selecting, booking, and paying for flights and hotels for a journey, as I described in my book Brain Rush. “The new [applications] that we’re building, they’re nothing other than a bunch of AI agents that we generate that are linked together with workflow,” he added. Oracle enjoys another advantage over cloud services rivals. “I know some of our competitors, they like to own buildings,” Oracle CEO Safra Katz said, according to CNBC. “That’s not really our specialty. Our specialty is the unique technology, the unique networking, the storage — just the whole way we put these systems together,” she added. However, this potential comes with significant risks. The stock’s premium valuation reflects high market expectations – if the market shifts money out of big tech companies or Oracle fails to beat and raise every quarter, its stock could fall.

The main problem appears to be integrating AI into the enterprise. "Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable profit and loss impact," noted the MIT NANDA Institute report. If companies find ways to make AI pay over the next four years, Oracle’s cloud services rapid growth could continue. Analysts are enthusiastic about Oracle’s prospects: One note of caution came from D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. While Lauria said Oracle’s projected cloud revenue figure was “absolutely staggering,” according to CNBC, he added the business is coming from Microsoft and Google who are “offloading their capacity to other data center providers. These are not organic customers to Oracle,” he added. While Wall Street is optimistic, 35 analysts who cover the stock set a price target of $263.93 – meaning Oracle is more than 21% over-valued.

Title: Oracle Stock Up 94% On Growth Forecast. Learn Whether To Buy $ORCL

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Oracle's stock surged significantly, driven by an extremely bullish long-term forecast for its cloud infrastructure, particularly in AI, despite missing recent quarterly earnings.The company projects massive cloud revenue growth, from $18 billion in FY2026 to $144 billion by FY2030, securing major AI contracts and leveraging its database advantage for AI inference.However, risks include substantial capital expenditure, fierce competition, and the potential for reduced AI investment if businesses don't see sufficient economic returns or during an economic downturn. Oracle shares have soared 94% since the beginning of 2025 – with a more than half of that gain coming in pre-market trading today. That huge gain took place after the Austin-based tech company announced results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026 that fell short of expectations. What sent Oracle stock soaring another 49 percentage points was the company’s outlook for the future of its cloud infrastructure business, according to CNBC. Will Oracle stock keep rising? The answer depends on whether Oracle can begin to beat investor expectations and raise guidance in future quarters. I think there is more upside to the stock for two reasons: However, over the longer-term, Oracle stock may plunge if companies stop investing so heavily in artificial intelligence. That could happen unless more of them reap economic benefits – such as faster revenue growth and considerable boosts in productivity. Oracle expects rapid growth in its cloud infrastructure business. "We expect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue to grow 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year — and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the subsequent four years," CEO Safra Catz in a statement. Oracle’s results for the quarter fell flat while the company’s growth forecast generated an outpouring of enthusiasm. Here are the key numbers: The question for investors is whether Oracle’s bullish growth forecasts suggest a continued rise in its stock. Here’s the bull case: Oracle’s latest earnings report suggests growth in demand and much higher revenue driven by companies seeking to benefit from AI. Oracle’s backlog is likely to grow even more. "We signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1," Catz said in a statement. Oracle expects to contract with several additional multibillion-dollar customers and for its RPO to exceed half a trillion dollars, Catz added. "We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who’s who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, and many others," Catz said in investor call featured by Yahoo! Finance. Oracle is targeting two related AI markets – services for training large language models and for inference – generating content from a trained AI model. “Millions of customers are using those AI models to run businesses and governments,” Oracle co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison said in the investor conference call featured by the Wall Street Journal. “AI inference will be used to run robotic factories, robotic cars, robotic greenhouses, biomolecular simulations for drug designs,” he added. Oracle’s unique advantage for AI inference is its databases that store private business data. The company’s “new AI database will make it easy for those businesses to query or ask questions of their private data, all of which adds to the bill for Oracle’s AI inference services,” Ellison said, according to the Journal. Oracle is also investing in AI agents – which help people to achieve specific goals such as selecting, booking, and paying for flights and hotels for a journey, as I described in my book Brain Rush. “The new [applications] that we’re building, they’re nothing other than a bunch of AI agents that we generate that are linked together with workflow,” he added. Oracle enjoys another advantage over cloud services rivals. “I know some of our competitors, they like to own buildings,” Oracle CEO Safra Katz said, according to CNBC. “That’s not really our specialty. Our specialty is the unique technology, the unique networking, the storage — just the whole way we put these systems together,” she added. However, this potential comes with significant risks. The stock’s premium valuation reflects high market expectations – if the market shifts money out of big tech companies or Oracle fails to beat and raise every quarter, its stock could fall. Moreover, the high capital expenditure required to fund its expansion could reduce cash flow and highlights the financial risks involved in its ambitious plans. In addition, Oracle faces significant competition from AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. While the urge to spend more on AI is currently powerful, if the economy goes into a recession, companies who buy cloud services may need to cut costs quickly to preserve cash. And since AI has yet to generate enough of a payoff to justify the investment, as I wrote in an August Forbes post, such spending could be curtailed if the economy contracts.

Title: 13 Ways To Future-Proof Your Career From Layoffs In 2025

ByRachel Wells, Contributor. You’ve seen the headlines. The U.S. labor market isn’t as optimistic as we would like to believe. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ revised data points to a significant reduction in the number of jobs available from last year to March 2025. The economy is almost a million jobs weaker than we thought. And to add to this, August’s Jobs Report points to an increasingly weakening job market, with the unemployment rate at 4.3%--the highest level since 2021--and just 22,000 jobs added to the market in August, in sharp contrast to economists’ expectations of more than 70,000 job gains in the U.S, reports CNN. The primary industries being hit with employment reductions and fewer jobs being added to the market, are: (Data taken from the BLS employment situation summary.) Can the U.S. job market get any worse? There are several factors that are likely responsible for the current state of the labor market in the United States. These factors include the federal employment upheaval under the current administration, beginning in January when federal workers were prohibited to work remotely, resulting in a wave of employees leaving their jobs as expected in a bid from DODGE to shrink the federal workforce, and consequently government spend. Another likely reason is the shutdown and reduction of workforces in various federal departments, again linked to DODGE. Third, this year we’ve seen the tariff war impacting industries, especially manufacturing and wholesale trade, within the United States. AI is another significant factor here, resulting in fewer jobs being added to the labor market as a whole. One million less jobs than predicted aligns perfectly with the layoffs trend we've been seeing over the past few years, specifically since the AI boom. This year, in February, we saw an unprecedented surge in tech layoffs not seen since the pandemic, and since then tech layoffs have exceeded the rate of layoffs since the pandemic. Big name companies like Microsoft, Intel, Glassdoor, Indeed, and others have been laying off workers by the hundreds and thousands. Marc Benioff, Salesforce CEO, said that AI is already achieving 50% of the work at the CRM company, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy anticipates a future where AI will be more significantly integrated across the company’s operations and there will be fewer Amazon employees within the next few years. All these factors explain why the U.S. labor market is much weaker than originally forecasted. With a weak U.S. jobs market, it’s only natural that professionals like you are filled with anxiety. This is giving rise to the trend of job-hugging, which is the opposite of job-hopping that occurred during the Great Resignation of 2022. “Job-hugging” is when you hold on to your job and are very reluctant to hand in your notice for fear that you may never step into regular employment again. You don’t like your job, you probably hate it, and you don’t give it 100%, but you're staying in it just to survive. Is that what you really want for your future? Is this how you expect to live the rest of your career, at the mercy of inflation, tariffs, rising record levels of unemployment, fewer jobs being available, and fierce job market competition? Is that how you intend to spend the next 10, 15, 20 or 25 years of your career? Surely, there must be more to work than job-hugging or being at the mercy of the economy. The good news is you don’t have to be. Here are some simple steps you can take today to regain control over your life, your finances and your career, and design a job and career that makes you fulfilled, happy, and financially free. Upskill in the skills of the future, by learning the certifications that teach in-demand high-income skills, like AI, critical thinking, data analysis, project management, etc. Make a career pivot and shift to industries or roles that are recession-proof and pay well, such as cybersecurity, for example. Establish your digital presence and build your online personal brand. Offer your skills on freelance platforms, such as Toptal, Upwork, or Contra, so that you have a secondary stream of income to fall back on. And you can build an entire business from this, if it takes off and is going very well. Create a portfolio career where you have several income streams, including passive income. Look for remote jobs that are work-from-anywhere. Seek companies based in Europe, Asia, or other parts of the world, that have flexible hiring policies, and allow for async working from anywhere in the world. Strengthen your LinkedIn presence by optimising your profile, strategically adding to your network, and engaging thoughtfully on posts on LinkedIn, providing quality insight and thought leadership. Post regularly on LinkedIn, at least two to three times a week. Refresh your resume at least once a year, so you never forget what you've achieved and accomplished, and your resume is always fresh and prepared in the event that you need it sooner than expected. Build a financial cushion of emergency savings and money for business investment. So you can launch a side hustle. Leverage your brain capital for consulting and contract retainer work. Stay abreast of trends in your industry and in the job market, using podcasts, newsletters, industry publications, and attending industry networking events and masterminds. Join membership associations within your industry for networking and job opportunities. Focus on roles that require strategy, leadership, and decision-making, as opposed to entry-level or repetitive skills that AI can easily replicate. What’s next for you now? Time to dust off your resume and optimize it for the jobs and skills of the future. Learn how to Write A Resume That Gets You Hired After A Layoff, then after reading that article, learn what you can do in the first month after being laid off here. Then, check out some free certifications you can undertake to upskill yourself at no cost in this article.

HYPE holders are smiling to the bank as potential issuers fight over USDH. The Hyperliquid’s USDH race is now down to Native Markets and Paxos. Who will win the deal by the 14th of September? Hyperliquid’s [HYPE] proposed stablecoin, USDH, has triggered one of the most aggressive bidding wars in the crypto sector. Top issuers like Ethena [ENA], Paxos, Sky [SKY] (formerly Maker), Frax, and others are all out fighting to be the official partner. But the top contender in the race, Native Markets, is a new player with no experience, which Dragonfly claims has been ‘fixed’ to win. Slamming the process as a ‘farce,’ Dragonfly VC managing partner Haseeb Qureshi alleged that it was rigged in favor of Native Markets. “Hearing from multiple bidders that none of the validators are interested in considering anyone besides Native Markets. It’s not even a serious discussion, as though there was a backroom deal already done.” Source: X He cited Polymarket odds, bidders, and Native Markets’ immediate proposal after Hyperliquid floated the request, suggesting the team had prior knowledge before the announcement was made public. At the time of writing, however, the contest has narrowed to Paxos and Native Markets. The chances of Paxos winning the bid surged to 47% after the revised proposal, but dropped a few hours later. Still, the market was pricing Native Markets for a likely win at nearly 60%. Source: Polymarket Most of the potential issuers are pledging 95%-100% HYPE value accrual, alongside support by regulated entities like BlackRock. Source: AMBCrypto All proposals from potential issuers should be finalized by the 10th of September. On the 11th of September, Hyperliquid validators should state their preferred potential issuer. The final vote by validators will be done on the 14th of September to allow stakers to align with the validators that mirror their choice. But what does Hyperliquid want to achieve with the USDH? And why now? Currently, Circle’s USDC dominates the decentralized exchange (DEX) and the chain, with $5.5 billion worth of USDC. However, the yield gained ($100M) is not shared with Hyperliquid but with rival Coinbase (as per its agreement with Circle). Source: Reciprocal Ventures Apart from ecosystem growth, the stablecoin should help handle regulatory risks. Especially on the on/off ramp side, according to James Evans, investment analyst at Reciprocal Ventures. “That risk could materialize as an attack on Hyperliquid’s on/off ramps. So in addition to being a product decision, having a compliant stablecoin could be a first step to building regulatory legitimacy.” Some, like Arthur Hayes, have backed Ethena for the USDH bid. But others have pointed out that Paxos and Ethena have existing stablecoin products that would lead to conflicting interests. Amid the bidding wars for USDH, HYPE holders have come out as the main beneficiary. The altcoin printed a new high of $55, up about 20% since the bidding began over the weekend.

Title: US  judge approves Vanguard’s $25m settlement over inflated tax bills

Time Published: 2025-09-10T12:54:08Z

A federal judge has granted preliminary approval to Vanguard Group’s $25m settlement of a lawsuit alleging that the mutual fund giant improperly burdened investors with excessive tax bills, reported Reuters. The settlement relates to the company’s target-date funds and comes after a previous $40m proposal was rejected. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more US District Judge John Murphy in Philadelphia deemed the settlement “sufficiently fair, reasonable, and adequate.” The initial $40m settlement offer, rejected on 19 May, was turned down by Murphy due to concerns that Vanguard could offset this amount against its January settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which he believed would better serve investors as it did not involve legal fees. Investors’ attorneys have highlighted that the $25m is in addition to a $133m fair fund established in the SEC case. Judge Murphy has scheduled a hearing for 6 January 2026, to consider final approval of the settlement. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The lawsuit stemmed from a December 2020 decision by Vanguard to lower the minimum investment required for its cheaper institutional fund classes from $100m to $5m. This change prompted a shift of investors from higher-cost retail classes to these institutional classes, resulting in asset sales and the distribution of taxable capital gains to the remaining investors. Vanguard, with headquarters in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, manages $11tn in assets as of 31 July, the news agency added. The case, known as In re Vanguard Chester Funds Litigation, is being heard in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, under case number 22-00955. In a separate development, a Texas federal court ruled against dismissing a separate lawsuit accusing Vanguard Group, BlackRock, and State Street’s asset management division of anti-competitive behaviour in the coal industry. US District Judge Jeremy Kernodle determined that most of the claims, which allege anti-competitive conduct by BlackRock, Vanguard Group, and State Street’s asset management branch, merit further examination in court.

Oracle (ORCL) shares soared Wednesday morning after the computing giant raised its outlook for cloud infrastructure sales and said it added several large new customers amid booming AI demand. The company, which has struck deals with big tech customers including Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), said it now sees cloud infrastructure sales jumping 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year, above its June forecast of 70% growth. CEO Safra Catz told investors that the company expects to sign-up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers in coming months to push its booked cloud orders over half a billion dollars. Leading into the company’s earnings release, Oracle shares had gained 45% so far in 2025, handily outpacing the S&P 500’s return over the same period, boosted by robust demand for its cloud infrastructure services and AI database integration tools. The stock was up 32% at $318 in recent premarket trading. Below, we take a closer look at Oracle’s weekly chart and use technical analysis to identify critical price levels that investors will likely be watching. After setting their all-time high in late July, Oracle shares consolidated in a flag pattern ahead of the company’s quarterly results, laying the groundwork for a continuation of the longer-term uptrend. Indeed, the stock looks set to gap to a fresh record high on Wednesday. It’s worth noting that the shares have already registered their highest volume this week since mid July, suggesting that some larger market participants rebalanced portfolios leading into the report. Let’s turn to Oracle’s chart to identify a potential upside target if the shares see an extended post-earnings rally and also point out a few support levels worth monitoring. Investors can project an upside target by using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as the measuring principle. When applying the analysis to Oracle’s chart, we calculate the stock’s strong uptrend that preceded the flag in points and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. For instance, we add $142 to $242, which projects a target of $384, implying an upside of nearly 60% from Tuesday’s closing price. Future attempts to fill the earnings-driven gap could see the price initially retest the $261 level. This area would likely attract buying interest near the prior record high and top of the flag pattern, which may turn into a critical support region on the chart. Finally, a close below this level opens the door for a more-significant drop to around $198. Investors may look to accumulate Oracle shares at this location near last year’s prominent December swing high, which also closely aligns with a brief pause during the stock’s June rally.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are mixed after major indexes hit new highs on Tuesday amid expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon; Oracle (ORCL) shares are surging after the company lifted it sales forecast on strong AI demand; a report on producer prices comes as investors keep a close eye on inflation data ahead of the Fed’s meeting next week; a federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump’s efforts to fire Fed Gov. Lisa Cook; and Novo Nordisk (NVO) announces layoffs amid slower growth in the weight loss drug market. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures were mixed after major stock indexes hit new highs on Tuesday. Investors today are watching inflation data as stocks have risen in anticipation of an interest rate cut by the Fed next week. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were slightly higher this morning, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell slightly. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading at around $112,400 recently, up from its overnight lows. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, ticked higher to 4.09% but remains near its lowest level since April. Gold futures were slightly higher, trading near a record high, while oil futures added about 1%. Shares of Oracle (ORCL) surged more than 30% in premarket trading after the cloud computing giant said it added several large new clients and boosted its outlook for cloud infrastructure sales on booming AI demand. Oracle said it sees cloud infrastructure sales jumping 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year as AI demand grows, up from a June forecast of more than 70%. Oracle posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.47 in the fiscal first quarter on revenue that rose 12% year-over-year to $14.9 billion, both below analysts' estimates as compiled by Visible Alpha. Oracle said its growing backlog from new contracts contributed to its more robust outlook. Today’s 8:30 a.m. ET release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) is expected to show inflation at the wholesale level moderated in August. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires estimate that the PPI will show wholesale prices rose 0.3% in August, down from 0.9% the month before. The wholesale inflation numbers come ahead of tomorrow’s closely watched Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, the last major piece of inflation data ahead of the Fed’s meeting next week. The central bank has held its key rate steady this year amid concerns about the impact that tariffs are having on inflation, though Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled recently that rate cuts may be warranted. A federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump’s efforts to remove Fed Gov. Lisa Cook. The injunction means Cook can stay in her role as her lawsuit challenging the dismissal moves forward. Trump, who has lambasted the Fed for not cutting interest rates, is attempting to remove the Fed governor on allegations of mortgage fraud that occurred before her appointment to the Fed's board. The judge ruled that the Federal Reserve Act limited the president’s authority to fire board members for actions that occurred before their terms, according to media reports. Cook has denied wrongdoing. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to eventually rule on Cook’s lawsuit challenging the dismissal. Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) said it plans to lay off 9,000 employees, making up more than 11% of its workforce, as the Danish drugmaker faces a slowdown in growth in the weight loss treatment market. Novo Nordisk said the layoffs will create a one-time cost of 8 billion Danish kroner ($1.26 billion). As a result, the company said it now expects full-year operating profit growth of between 4% and 10%, down from the 10% to 16% profit growth it projected in August. The move comes after Novo Nordisk brought in a new CEO in August. U.S.-traded shares of Novo Nordisk were up about 1% in recent premarket trading.

Title: Hyperliquid’s USDH stablecoin race heats up as Native Markets takes lead amid Paxos’ proposal

With 84% Polymarket odds, Native Markets aims to solidify its lead against evolving proposals from industry veterans. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Hyperliquid’s decision to launch its stablecoin has sparked one of the most competitive governance battles in recent memory. Last week, the decentralized exchange, which had been relying on Circle’s USDC for its liquidity, announced plans to introduce USDH as its native stablecoin. The move immediately attracted a wave of bidders, each vying for the right to issue the token and capture billions in potential value. At least eight organizations have already submitted proposals, including established players like Paxos, Ethena, Agora, and OpenEden. Validators on the Hyperliquid network will ultimately decide who secures the mandate, but in the meantime, speculators have taken to Polymarket to place their bets on the outcome. According to Polymarket odds, one group, Native Markets, stands out as the clear favorite in a market above the $1 million trading volume mark as of press time. Crypto traders on the decentralized marketplace assigned the newcomer a 90% chance of winning the validator vote, but that percentage has dropped to 84% at the time of this report. Native Markets was formed specifically to compete for USDH and is led by Max Fiege, an investor within the Hyperliquid ecosystem. The firm’s pitch proposes a hybrid reserve model in which off-chain assets would be managed by BlackRock, while the on-chain reserves would be held through Superstate using Bridge, a Stripe-owned platform. Native Markets also pledged to split yield from reserve assets, with half earmarked for HYPE token buybacks and half for USDH expansion. Meanwhile, Native Market’s proposal structure has generated both interest and skepticism from community members. In Agora’s proposal, Nick Van Eck, the founder of Agora, pointed out that Native Markets’ proposal reliance on Stripe could prove detrimental to Hyperliquid in the long run. According to him: Join The Crypto Investor Blueprint — 5 days of pro-level strategies to turbocharge your portfolio. Please add [email protected] to your email whitelist. Stay connected via “Stripe recently announced their plans for Tempo, a new layer 1 blockchain. Stripe is committed to driving activity to this ecosystem from a variety of players. How long until Stripe and Bridge start pushing users and perps from other financial applications directly to Tempo instead of Hyperliquid?” Despite these concerns, Dragonfly Capital’s Haseeb Qureshi suggested that Native Markets may have had advance notice of the request-for-proposals process, given how quickly its submission appeared. He wrote: “Everyone else scrambled over the weekend to put something together. So this whole USDH RFP was basically custom made for Native Markets.” However, Alex Svavenik, the CEO of Nansen, countered this claim by stressing that validators have been deeply engaged with all bidders. According to him, the process is far more competitive than critics suggest, with validators actively seeking the best long-term option for Hyperliquid. While Hyperliquid validators might appear inclined toward Native Markets, observers point to Paxos, Ethena, and Agora as candidates with stronger institutional track records. Moreover, these rival firms have been refining their offers, and new entrants are introducing new bids for the USDH stablecoin. On Sept. 10, Paxos unveiled a revised plan centered on a partnership with PayPal. According to the firm, this collaboration would embed USDH into PayPal and Venmo products, list HYPE on PayPal’s ramps, and inject $20 million in incentives for the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Paxos also set strict revenue caps to assure the community of its long-term alignment. It wrote: “Paxos takes nothing until we reach $1 billion in TVL and stays capped at 5% post $5 billion TVL. Any fees earned by Paxos through this milestone will be held in HYPE tokens.” Speaking on the updated proposal, Max Fantle, a Paxos executive, said: “PayPal and Venmo have 400M+ users. Paxos is the only neutral, regulated issuer that can unlock an entirely new institutional customer segment for Hyperliquid that no other issuer can reach.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Business A person walks pass a Nvidia logo at Computex in Taipei, Taiwan June 5, 2024. REUTERS/Ann Wang/ File Photo Quantum computing startup PsiQuantum said on Wednesday it has raised $1 billion in its latest funding round at a valuation of $7 billion, and announced a collaboration with Nvidia to speed up development of its quantum computers. The Series E funding round was led by investment firms BlackRock, Temasek and Baillie Gifford and saw participation from new investors including Nvidia's venture capital arm NVentures, Macquarie Capital and Ribbit Capital. PsiQuantum said the funding will help the company go ahead with sites in Brisbane, Australia and Chicago, Illinois as well as roll out large test systems to prove its design. Quantum technology has the potential to perform calculations that would stump even the most powerful AI systems and could unlock a host of scientific and commercial applications, including cybersecurity. The technology may help in drug discovery and in materials research.

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Good morning. Hello. It’s Jeremy here. First up, I want to wish Andrew, who normally writes this newsletter, a big congratulations on the birth of his new baby boy, who made his world debut yesterday! Andrew had to leave Fortune Brainstorm Tech early to greet his new arrival, but let’s catch him and you up on a few things he missed. Here were some highlights from yesterday: And don’t forget that you can watch the livestream of the conference’s final day here.Apple’s big “awe-dropping” hardware show yesterday ended up being more like a “meh dropping” (doesn’t quite have the same ring to it), at least as far as the company’s investors were concerned. The stock drifted lower in after-hours trading.While the new iPhone Air is impressively svelte and got phone aficionados talking, many of the other announcements—updated Apple watches, new AirPods—were more niche and unlikely to alter perceptions that the company has lost some of its former mojo. Fortune’s Dave Smith has a breakdown of the announcements below.Today, the tech world is eagerly awaiting another sort of debut—fintech Klarna’s IPO on the NYSE. The Swedish buy-now-pay-later financing firm is expected to price its shares at $40, valuing the company at about $15 billion. That will earn a nice 6x return for venture capital firm Sequoia, which invested about $500 million in Klarna starting back in 2010, according to a story in The Information. But it’s a lot less than the $46 billion valuation the company achieved in a Softbank-led round in 2021 (a round that Sequoia pointedly did not participate in.) We’ll see how much the stock pops today on opening. Beatrice Nolan has more on Klarna in the news section below.Before we go, be sure to check out Leo Schwarz’s great profile piece on Ramp, the fast-growing fintech that is automating how corporate finance departments work.And also worth a read is Sharon Goldman’s feature on Cohere, the Canadian AI company that many considered an also-ran in the AI race but which is making a bid for renewed relevancy with a big hire from Meta, a new CFO, and a $7 billion valuation.Onwards…—Jeremy Kahn Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Fortune Tech? Drop a line here. Apple’s “Awe Dropping” event has wrapped—and the focus of Tuesday’s show was mobile devices: the iPhone, the Watch, and AirPods. In total, Apple unveiled eight new products, including a brand-new member of the iPhone family, the iPhone Air. Highlights include the AirPods Pro 3 with improved ANC, live translation, and built-in heart-rate tracking. Three new Watches, the Series 11 with blood pressure monitoring and better durability, the SE 3 with an always-on display and faster charging, and the rugged Ultra 3 with satellite connectivity and a record 42-hour battery. On the phone side, Apple introduced the iPhone 17 with a ProMotion display, upgraded cameras, and the new iPhone Air as a fresh model in the lineup. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max bring lighter builds, ceramic shield backs, major camera upgrades, and the longest iPhone battery life ever. Here’s the full rundown of everything the tech giant announced at its annual event. The launches come as Apple leans on hardware innovation to buy time for its delayed AI strategy, with Wall Street watching closely to see if these devices can spark stronger upgrade cycles. — Dave Smith Klarna's long-awaited initial public offering (IPO) is finally here. The buy-now-pay-later financing firm is expected to price its shares at $40 per share, valuing the company at about $15 billion, significantly lower than the $45 billion valuation it achieved in 2021. Despite the lower valuation, major investor Sequoia is set to gain nearly $3 billion from its $500 million investment in the company over the last 15 years, per The Information. The fintech, which was once Europe’s most valuable VC-backed company, has been planning the listing for years but economic and political headwinds, including sweeping U.S. tariffs have delayed its market debut several times. Investors are hopeful the company could set a trend for high-growth fintech listings after a period of slowdown in both tech IPOs and M&A activity. Losses in the first half of the fiscal year and an internal AI pullback could cast a shadow over Klarna’s IPO. Investors will be watching closely to see if the company can pull off a strong market debut. — Beatrice Nolan As Congress considers new rules that restrict the sale of AI chips to China, Nvidia has a new strategy to protect the billion-dollar market. The Senate and the House are weighing rules that would require U.S. companies to prioritize domestic access to the technology before it can be sold abroad. To tackle this and protect the potentially $50 billion market, the chipmaker has painted the limits as left-wing paranoia pushed by a group of AI doomers, according to a report from The New York Times. Nvidia’s aggressive push has rattled Republicans backing the restrictions and pulled Washington into what is primarily a Silicon Valley-based clash between “accelerationists,” who want to supercharge AI growth, and “doomers,” who raise concerns about the technology’s risks. David Sacks, the White House AI czar, has reiterated Nvidia’s attacks, labeling the regulation advocates a “doomer cult.” On his All-In podcast, Sacks even suggested they should be “Loomered,” suggesting far-right activist Laura Loomer should campaign to get them dismissed. The Senate is expected to vote on the amendment, which could reshape the U.S.–China tech relations, as early as Tuesday. — Beatrice Nolan OpenAI’s largest investor is working with rival AI lab, Anthropic. Microsoft is set to use Anthropic’s tech for AI features in Office 365 after executives found Claude Sonnet 4 outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-5 in some tasks, according to a report from The Information. Microsoft has said the $30-per-month Copilot add-on already has over 100 million users, and analysts estimate it could be a $1 billion annual business. Microsoft will access Anthropic’s models through Amazon Web Services, and the move will blend Anthropic and OpenAI’s technology in the apps. It’s the latest sign that Microsoft is taking steps to lessen its reliance on its closer partner in the AI space. This isn’t Microsoft’s first pivot away from OpenAI: earlier this year, the company announced that its GitHub Copilot codewriting tools would use Anthropic’s models to power advanced “agent” features, rather than relying solely on OpenAI. The move comes amid months of negotiations between OpenAI and the tech giant over the ChatGPT maker’s plan to restructure its for-profit division in preparation for a potential public offering. — Beatrice Nolan PwC U.K. cuts entry-level hiring amid AI uncertainty. The firm's U.K. chief admitted that graduate hiring is “under pressure.” U.S. tech companies accused of enabling China’s digital police state. An AP investigation found that Amazon, IBM, and Dell helped build China’s surveillance state. Robinhood says its latest product will fix social media trading. The trading giant has a new app feature called “Robinhood Social” where users can follow prominent traders. Oracle soars on ambitious cloud growth forecasts. Oracle’s shares surged after projecting $144 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue by 2030. Meta’s new AI team is stirring up new tensions with old staff.

Title: A Record 500 American Billionaires Are Too Poor To Make The Forbes 400
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinadilicosa/2025/09/10/a-record-500-american-billionaires-are-too-poor-to-make-the-forbes-400/

ByMartina Di Licosa, Contributor. Few things could make the average billionaire feel poor—The Forbes 400 list is one of them. There are now a record 900 billionaires in the U.S., meaning a record 500 people have amassed a ten-figure fortune but are still simply not rich enough to make the top 400 in 2025. It’s a tough list to crack, and getting tougher. Back in 1982, there were fewer than two dozen billionaires on the original Forbes 400, which required a minimum net worth of just $100 million to make the cut. Four decades later, it now takes $3.8 billion to make the ranking, up $500 million from just a year ago. More than 90% of last year’s list held onto their spot this year. Still, 19 billionaires worth $3.7 billion came up just short of stealing a place on the ranking. That includes design software firm Figma’s cofounder Dylan Field and athleisure brand Alo Yoga’s cofounders Danny Harris and Marco DeGeorge, as well as Dario Amodei and five other cofounders of AI juggernaut Anthropic (a seventh cofounder of the company, Christopher Olah, is also worth $3.7 billion but is Canadian). Another 11 billionaires missed the cut by just $200 million, with a $3.6 billion fortune. Those rich enough to make Forbes’ billionaires list but not rich enough to make The Forbes 400 also include some of the world’s most famous people. Embattled WWE boss Vince McMahon is $400 million too poor. Oprah Winfrey would need another $700 million to make the grade. Taylor Swift, who has added an additional $500 million to her fortune since Forbes first named her a billionaire in 2023 on the back of her global Eras Tour, is still $2.2 billion short. Several recent additions to the billionaires list missed this year’s Forbes 400 as well, including South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone (net worth: $1.2 billion apiece) and Chipotle founder Steve Ells, who has fallen from the billionaire ranks amid the fast-casual Mexican restaurant chain’s slumping stock price. There’s always next year for these billionaires. Just ask Robinhood cofounder Vlad Tenev, Dutch Bros coffee cofounder Travis Boersma, and the 12 other billionaires who made The Forbes 400 for the first time in 2025. The brains behind South Park got rich one offensive episode at a time. Now in its 27th season, the hit show has won four Emmys, and its creators ranked #1 on Forbes’ most recent list of the highest-paid TV showrunners. Parker and Stone became billionaires in July after they signed a $1.5 billion streaming deal to bring South Park to Paramount+ globally. The first active NBA player to become a billionaire, his athletic talent has earned him more than $500 million in pretax salary over the course of his two-decade career with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat, and his current team, the Los Angeles Lakers. Then there’s his off-court earnings, upwards of $900 million pretax, from business ventures like production company SpringHill and endorsement deals with brands including Nike and Beats by Dre. Swift holds the record for the most albums to sell one million copies in a single week in the modern era, with seven of her albums, including 1989 (Taylor's Version) and The Tortured Poets Department, reaching that milestone in seven days. She toured her way into the billionaire ranks, joining the list in 2023 while traveling the globe on her Eras Tour, which generated more than $2 billion of revenue and ranks as the highest-grossing concert tour of all time. Her family made her famous, but most of Kardashian’s wealth comes from shapewear brand Skims, which she founded in 2019 and is expanding internationally with stores in London and Dubai. In 2022, she cofounded private equity firm SKKY Partners, which has invested in companies like UK-based luxury skincare brand 111SKIN and premium, truffle-based sauce and condiments purveyor TRUFF. Field cofounded web-based design company Figma in 2012 after dropping out of Brown University. In 2022, he agreed to sell his startup to Adobe for $20 billion, but the deal was killed by regulators. Figma went public in July 2025, and its stock more than tripled on its first trading day. It’s lost nearly 40% of its value since, with the company reporting slower sales growth and worse-than-expected earnings for the second quarter of 2025, as well as third-quarter guidance that disappointed analysts and investors. Londsdale got his start working for billionaire investor Peter Thiel's hedge fund. He is now the managing partner of $6 billion (assets) venture capital firm 8VC. He cofounded data mining firm Palantir in 2003; it now has a market capitalization of $370 billion. Lonsdale was also an early investor in Palmer Luckey's Anduril. Scale AI’s cofounder and former CEO briefly became the world’s youngest self-made billionaire in 2022, at age 25, after private investors valued his data labeling company at $7.3 billion. Then private markets plunged and knocked Wang from the billionaire ranks. He regained his title in 2024, when Scale raised $1 billion at a $13.8 billion valuation, and has held onto it ever since. In June, Wang’s fortune soared by $1.2 billion, to $3.2 billion, after Meta paid more than $14 billion for 49% of Scale, and Wang left Scale to become the social media giant’s new chief AI officer. As CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick rebuilt the trading and investment management firm after 658 employees died in the 9/11 attacks. Now he’s serving in the Trump administration as Secretary of Commerce, focusing on tariffs, and has turned the company's management over to a trio of co-CEOs. Luckey got rich creating Oculus VR and, more recently, selling weapons. His defense startup Anduril boomed with the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “We want to be the company that when the DoD needs something, we're the first people they think of,” he told Forbes at the time. Now he’s building crypto bank Erebor, which is awaiting regulatory approval. The Blackstone executive’s Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE) owns stakes in the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers, the NHL’s New Jersey Devils, and the Premier League’s Crystal Palace.

Title: Oracle Stock To $900: Its Simple Math
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/10/oracle-stock-to-900-its-simple-math/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T08:37:32Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Oracle’s meteoric rise continues to defy expectations. With a 36% surge following its latest earnings and a cumulative 3x gain since early 2023, the enterprise software giant is rewriting the playbook for cloud transformation. But here’s the million-dollar question: Can Oracle realistically triple again from current levels to reach $900 per share? The numbers suggest it's not just possible—it might be inevitable. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – JNJ Stock To $250? Oracle just dropped a bombshell that caught even the most bullish analysts off guard. The company’s remaining performance obligations (RPO) exploded 359% year-over-year to $455 billion from the previous quarter's $138 billion figure. What does this actually mean? Think of RPO as Oracle’s locked-in revenue pipeline—contracts already signed and sealed, just waiting to be delivered. This isn't wishful thinking or ambitious projections; it's money already committed by customers. Oracle didn’t just report numbers—they laid out a clear trajectory for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue that reads like a growth investor's dream: Here’s what makes them credible: most of this revenue is already baked into the reported RPO. Oracle isn't gambling on future demand—they're simply executing on contracts already in hand. Why is everyone suddenly throwing money at Oracle’s cloud? The AI revolution requires massive computational infrastructure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) has positioned itself as a premier destination for AI workloads. As companies race to implement AI solutions, they need reliable, scalable cloud platforms—something that Oracle provides. The timing couldn’t be better. While competitors face capacity constraints and pricing pressures, Oracle is expanding aggressively and capturing market share in the highest-growth segments. Let’s break down the path to a $900 stock price with simple, conservative assumptions: Assuming Oracle maintains its operational leverage and margins improve modestly with cloud scale: From today’s levels, that represents a roughly 3x upside. Is a 40x P/E reasonable for 2030? For a company growing cloud revenue at a projected 34% average annual rate with locked-in contracts extending years into the future, a 40x multiple seems conservative, especially in a market that regularly assigns higher multiples to companies with less predictable growth. Note that tech stocks like Microsoft and Amazon currently trade at 35-40 times trailing earnings. Look at Oracle’s Valuation Ratios for more details. No investment thesis is complete without acknowledging potential headwinds. Oracle faces several challenges that could derail this optimistic scenario. Competition intensifies as cloud becomes table stakes. Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud aren’t sitting idle. They have deeper pockets and broader ecosystems. Oracle’s advantage in AI infrastructure could erode if competitors aggressively price or innovate their way back into contention. Economic headwinds could pressure enterprise spending, and companies might delay cloud migrations or renegotiate contracts. While Oracle’s RPO provides some insulation, large enterprise deals can still be postponed or downsized during tough times. Execution risk on this massive scale-up. Growing from $59 billion to $200 billion in annual revenue requires flawless execution across hiring, infrastructure buildout, and customer delivery. Any stumbles could shake confidence in these ambitious projections. Multiple compressions could be more severe than expected. As Oracle matures further, the market might assign lower multiples than our 40x assumption, particularly if interest rates remain elevated. Our separate analysis focusing on the downside risk for Oracle offers more details. Oracle’s latest results represent more than just a good quarter—they signal a fundamental shift in the company’s trajectory and market position. With $455 billion in locked-in future revenue and a clear path to $200 billion in annual sales by 2030, the case for $900 per share is surprisingly straightforward. That said, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the Trefis High-Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So is this a slam dunk? Not quite. Execution risks are real, competition is fierce, and market conditions can change rapidly. But for investors willing to bet on Oracle’s ability to capitalize on the AI-driven cloud boom, the risk-reward equation looks compelling. The 30% after-hours pop might actually be the conservative reaction. When a company provides this level of revenue visibility with this kind of growth trajectory, a 3x move over the next four to five years starts looking less like speculation and more like inevitability. The question isn’t whether Oracle can reach $900—it's whether investors have the patience to ride the journey.

Title: Polymarket’s Top Trader Bets on a 50bps Fed Rate Cut Next Week
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/10/polymarket-s-top-trader-bets-on-a-50bps-fed-rate-cut-next-week
Time Published: 2025-09-10T06:12:26Z

A leading trader on decentralized betting platform Polymarket, who goes by the name JustWakingUp, is wagering that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates by 50 basis points (bps) next week. According to X handle Polymarket Whales, JustWakingUp is the platform’s most prolific trader, boasting nearly $400 million in total trading volume to date and profits exceeding $2 million. The trader has placed a $15,000 bet that the Fed will reduce rates by 50 bps to 3.75% next week and is already showing a 3% gain on the position as of writing. The trader stands to make roughly $226,000 if the Fed does cut rates by 5 bps. The market, however, largely expects the Fed to deliver a 25 basis point cut next week, with the CME’s FedWatch Tool assigning a 91% probability to such an outcome. That said, the odds of a jumbo 50 bps cut have surged to nearly 10% following Friday’s disappointing August jobs report, reflecting growing expectations of more aggressive easing. BlackRock and StanChart have called for a 50 bps cut. Adding to market expectations, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Tuesday that the economy added 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months ending March 2025 than previously estimated, marking the largest annual downward revision on record. Traders are now closely watching Wednesday’s U.S. Producer Price Index and Thursday’s Consumer Price Index data releases. Softer-than-expected readings could add to expectations for a 50 bps cut, potentially sending bitcoin and stocks higher.

September 10, 2025 01:00 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 10 September 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced a company-wide transformation to simplify its organisation, improve the speed of decision-making, and reallocate resources towards the company’s growth opportunities in diabetes and obesity. As part of the transformation, Novo Nordisk intends to reduce the global workforce by approximately 9,000 of the 78,400 positions in the company, with around 5,000 reductions expected in Denmark. The transformation reflects the Company’s commitment to meet rising global demand while also competing in a more dynamic and consumer-driven obesity market, as evidenced by the recent slowdown in growth. Over the past years, Novo Nordisk’s rapid scaling has increased organisational complexity and costs. The transformation aims at addressing that complexity, so Novo Nordisk can invest more behind its science, commercial capabilities and manufacturing ramp-up – aiming to reach the millions of people who remain untreated. Mike Doustdar, Novo Nordisk president and CEO, said: “As the global leader in obesity and diabetes, Novo Nordisk delivers life-changing products for patients worldwide. But our markets are evolving, particularly in obesity, as it has become more competitive and consumer-driven. Our company must evolve as well. This means instilling an increased performance-based culture, deploying our resources ever more effectively, and prioritising investment where it will have the most impact – behind our leading therapy areas.” Investment priorities, timing and further initiatives The workforce reduction is expected across the Company, including staff areas and headquarters functions, and is expected to deliver total annualised savings of around DKK 8 billion by the end of 2026. The savings will be redirected to growth opportunities in diabetes and obesity, including commercial execution initiatives and R&D programmes. The implementation will begin immediately, and the Company expects to communicate with affected employees over the next few months, pending negotiations as per local legal labour market requirements. Further, additional initiatives are to be implemented to enhance organisational focus, performance culture and speed of decision-making as well as cost efficiencies. Novo Nordisk President and CEO Mike Doustdar added: “It is always difficult to see talented and valued colleagues go, but we are convinced that this is the right thing to do for the long-term success of Novo Nordisk. We need a shift in our mindset and approach so we can be faster and more agile. Our transformation plan is designed to deliver this. By realigning our resources now, we will be able to prioritise investments to drive sustainable growth and future innovation for the millions of patients with chronic diseases globally, particularly in diabetes and obesity.” One-off financial implications The company-wide transformation comes with an expected DKK 8 billion in net one-off restructuring costs, including impairment charges. Restructuring costs of around DKK 9 billion will be incurred in the third quarter of 2025, countered by savings of around DKK 1 billion in the fourth quarter. Consequently, Novo Nordisk expects an estimated one-off negative impact of around 6 percentage points on full-year operating profit growth at CER in 2025 compared to the operating profit outlook issued 6 August. This change in expectations for 2025 only factors in the one-off restructuring costs described above. The forward-looking statements section on page 26 in the Financial report for the first six months of 2025 (Company Announcement No 20/2025) also apply to this company announcement. Novo Nordisk’s disclosure of the financial results for the first nine months of 2025 and financial outlook for 2025 will be published on 5 November. Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark. Our purpose is to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases built upon our heritage in diabetes. We do so by pioneering scientific breakthroughs, expanding access to our medicines and working to prevent and ultimately cure disease. Novo Nordisk employs about 78,400 people in 80 countries and markets its products in around 170 countries. Novo Nordisk's B shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen (Novo-B). Its ADRs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NVO). For more information, visit novonordisk.com, Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn and YouTube.

Title: CoinShares Sets Sights on Wall Street: Will the $1.2B Nasdaq Debut Redefine Crypto
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/coinshares-sets-sights-on-wall-street-1-2b-nasdaq/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T03:00:56Z
Full Content:
CoinShares, Europe’s largest digital asset manager with approximately $10 billion in assets under management, has announced plans to go public in the United States through a $1.2 billion merger with Vine Hill Capital, a Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The transaction would see CoinShares shift from Stockholm to Wall Street, signaling a major step in its bid for global dominance. Ranked as the fourth-largest digital asset exchange-traded product (ETP) manager globally, behind BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity, CoinShares currently holds a commanding 34% market share in Europe. Over the past two years, its assets under management have tripled, fueled by strong inflows and the rapid expansion of its product lineup, which has grown from just four offerings in 2021 to 32 across multiple platforms. CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti described the move as “far more than a venue change,” framing the Nasdaq listing as a gateway to global leadership. He highlighted the U.S. as the hub of digital asset innovation, where institutional demand and improving regulatory clarity are creating fertile ground for expansion. CoinShares operates with industry-leading margins, 76% adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2025, and has built a diversified business model based on recurring fee revenues supplemented by trading activities. With its proven European strategy, the company now seeks to capture U.S. investors by introducing a broader suite of digital asset products, including tokenized real-world assets. The $1.2 billion deal, priced at a discount compared to peer valuations, includes a $50 million institutional anchor investment. Both company boards have approved the merger, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. Upon completion, the combined entity will trade under Odysseus Holdings Limited. The timing of CoinShares’ U.S. expansion coincides with a wave of favorable regulatory developments, including the rollback of restrictive SEC policies and the drafting of new legislation aimed at fostering a clearer market structure for crypto. If successful, CoinShares’ Nasdaq debut could not only strengthen its foothold in the world’s largest asset management market but also set a precedent for how European crypto firms scale globally.

Halol facility under import alert, resulting in refusal of shipments into US. (Negative) Gold – Glinting & Blazing and approaching $4000 US Federal Reserve Policy Outlook, Central Bank Accumulation, Geopolitical Tensions, ETF and Institutional Flows remains the key drivers behind the rally. US inflation hasn’t been fully caged with FED independence remaining under pressure and geopolitics also adding sparks. This may not last forever, but the near-term tide and current is in favor of gold. Gold is turning out to be the main course, serving hot, in one’s portfolio. New highs are in the face of a fresh political crisis in France, Japan and the US sanctions against Russia. Rate cuts bets have intensified after a weaker-than-expected US jobs report last Friday. Generally risk and refuge (Stocks & Gold) do not rally together but this cycle seems diƯerent with lingering inflation, US federal reserve rate cuts and tariƯ driven backdrops. Gold rallying is not a speculative froth but a diversification game by the Central Banks from dollar monopoly to gold. Traders might view it as a hot money chase, but the Central Banks preservation leads to built up in the gold vault and pulling it oƯ the market, creating a scarcity premium. Just an arithmetic of 1% movement from treasuries into bullion could lead to a gold rise beyond $4000 an ounce, or even more. Headwinds Bullish moves may be challenging on growing skepticism over the impact of the Supreme Court verdict (October 14th) on Trump’s plea on the tariƯ matter. US inflation data for August is due this week with an expected upside due to tariƯs, which may have a bearing on the US Fed rate cut decisions. Markets are on a close watch. Levels On any eventuality of a gold correction, immediate support is seen at $3616 and $3578. Up to 16th Sept’25 the gold volatility could witness rally beyond $3700 for a $3781 target which acts as a stoploss for the shorts targeting $3422.

The company has shown encouraging signs of turnaround, but the FY25 profit was largely aided by tax credits and core profitability remains thin. At a P/E of over 60x, the issue looks aggressively priced, especially with most of the proceeds going to existing shareholders through the OFS. For investors, this IPO is a high-risk, high-reward bet, suitable only for those with a long-term horizon who believe in the company’s ability to scale sustainably as online penetration deepens. Our stance would be to ‘apply with caution,’ given the growth potential but stretched valuations.” Urban Company IPO subscribed 5% within minutes of opening.

A major downward revision to Nonfarm Payrolls showed 911,000 fewer jobs added between March 2024 and March 2025 than previously reported. Coupled with last week’s weak labor data, markets are now pricing in three rate cuts this year, including one at next week’s Fed meeting. Inflation figures due later this week could further shape rate expectations. Meanwhile, gold’s rally is also being supported by safe-haven demand amid geopolitical risks, US tariff concerns, and strong central bank buying. The metal is up 39% year-to-date. On Tuesday, the 10Y benchmark (6.33 GS 2035) opened 1 bps lower at 6.46% vs 6.47% tracking the fall in US Treasury yields as the sharply lower US non-farm payrolls data induced traders to fully factor in a 25bps rate cut by the Federal Reserve on Sep 17 policy.

Market participants now await India’s CPI inflation data due to be released on Sep 12, Friday for further directions.

The deceleration in growth is due to a slowdown in government capex (fiscal consolidation and execution limits in key sectors) and due to heightened caution in the private sector (muted near-term demand, tariffs, etc.). While high growth (20%+) seen post COVID-19 is unlikely anytime soon, we believe ~10-11% growth in capex is very much achievable and sustainable given the continuing policy focus (central govt capex is up sharply YTD), very strong power-related capex (which should continue for the next several years), solid balance sheets, strong cash flows, and healthy capex intentions of corporates. A 10% growth environment offers pockets of opportunity for healthy earnings growth – we prefer industrial names with stronger tailwinds and optionality (CG Power), strong and diversified end markets (Cummins India), and the possibility of an uptick in margins (Thermax). We initiate coverage of ABB India at Neutral, and of Siemens and BHEL at UW. Our order of preference in industrials is L&T, CG Power, Cummins India and Thermax. Stick to growth and visibility: Prefer L&T, CG Power, Cummins and Thermax – L&T remains our top pick with its attractive valuation (24x core FY27E P/E) with high RoCEs (30%+) and EPS growth (18%+). In this report, we initiate coverage of: 1) CG Power at OW (strong growth, supported by expanding transformer capacity and optionality from OSAT), 2) Cummins India at OW (demand visibility, strong margin performance), 3) Thermax at OW (margin tailwinds as low margin projects end). We also initiate coverage of ABB India and Praj at Neutral, and Siemens and BHEL at UW.

Also, the price is now above both 21- and 50-day moving averages. While the price action shows that the stock has been flat in the past few sessions, the breakout remains valid, and we expect it to soon see another leg of uptrend.

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BlackRock moved $640 million in crypto assets to Coinbase Prime over two days, with deposits of 44,774 ETH and 900 BTC on September 9, following similar moves on September 8. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager and the leading institution in Bitcoin BTC $114 011 24h volatility: 1.6% Market cap: $2.27 T Vol. 24h: $48.11 B and Ethereum ETH $4 433 24h volatility: 2.4% Market cap: $535.09 B Vol. 24h: $36.58 B exchange-traded funds (ETFs), offering via iShares products IBIT and ETHA, traded on Nasdaq. Differently from TradFi, part of BlackRock’s activities can be seen on-chain, with BTC and ETH moves to (deposits) and from (withdrawals) Coinbase Prime accounts, usually representing sales and purchases, respectively. On that note, Lookonchain and other on-chain analytic tools have been monitoring BlackRock activity, spotting recent likely sell-offs in the past two days, with significant deposits to Coinbase. On September 9, BlackRock-owned accounts deposited 44,774 ETH, worth $195.29 million, and 900 BTC, worth $101.67 million, to Coinbase Prime, based on Lookonchain’s post. Before that, on September 8, the asset manager was seen depositing 72,370 ETH, worth $312 million, and 266.79 BTC, worth $29.88 million. BlackRock just sold 44,774 $ETH($195.29M) and 900 $BTC($101.67M) again.https://t.co/bcKGkl1VXE pic.twitter.com/xyubPNpGjK — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 9, 2025 BlackRock’s market-making activities are a direct reflection of the ETFs’ net capital flows. They should represent the real-world adjustment and settlement of the ETFs’ holdings to match investor demand for shares, bridging traditional finance (TradFi) trading on Nasdaq with the crypto market. Nevertheless, the deposits and withdrawals are not necessarily representing all the sales and purchases in real time—simply reserve adjustments. For example, on September 8, IBIT and ETHA saw net flows of +229 BTC, worth $25.50 million, and -43,770 ETH, worth $192.70 million, respectively, according to data from Coinglass. On September 9, however, IBIT added 227 BTC. Lookonchain reported this movement in the September 9 update, showing similar numbers that conflict with the recently observed on-chain activity. Total Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETF net inflows | Source: Coinglass Both assets had massive outflows last Friday, on September 5, which may have required the reserve adjustments on Coinbase Prime, as seen earlier today from the Lookonchain report, causing large deposits and sell-offs. Or, institutions are positioning in advance of a yet unknown pricing event, as smart money like BlackRock can be seen as a market canary. Now, the price charts appear to be forming a bullish structure for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, potentially signaling a recovering institutional interest, again conflicting with the signal from Wall Street whales. Additionally, Arkham has reported BlackRock is “buying more” cryptocurrencies, reaching over $100 billion in total reserves. BLACKROCK NOW HOLDS OVER $100B IN CRYPTO AND THEY’RE BUYING MORE pic.twitter.com/7eRAzJ0fod — Arkham (@arkham) September 9, 2025 CrypNuevo, a prominent Bitcoin analyst with a relevant accuracy rate, believes BTC is poised for a bull rally in the following days, hunting upward liquidity in the expectation of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. $BTC Sunday update: 10 days until the first Interest Rate cut this cycle, and the chart is undecided with choppy Price Action. Uptrend structure is intact but sentiment is bearish in this pullback and many are calling it a sell the news event. How am I playing this? 🧵↓(1/7) pic.twitter.com/h1Y4DhFXK7 — CrypNuevo 🔨 (@CrypNuevo) September 7, 2025 Other indicators, like Tether minting 2 billion USDT during a market dip, very similar to what happened in December 2024, could also suggest it is time to buy and not sell, as seen in BlackRock’s recent activities. All that only evidences the volatility and complexity of short-term speculation, which is affected by a lot of nuance and different factors, together with big players’ movements.

September 09, 2025 17:43 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Sept. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Rocket Lab on February 27, 2025 with a Class Period from November 12, 2024 to February 25, 2025. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Rocket Lab have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Title: Progress Report: Saks Global Execs Talk Integrations, Plans and Opportunities

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Growth with Amazon overseas, reducing over-assortments, reviving the Saks flagship's holiday light show, and digging into the data to differentiate from competitors are on the agenda. Senior Editor, Retail Saks Global’s $2.7 billion takeover of the Neiman Marcus Group hasn’t been easy and has kept many vendors on edge. But in a media briefing Tuesday morning at Bergdorf Goodman, Marc Metrick, chief executive officer, along with Emily Essner, president and chief commercial officer, and Tracy Margolies, president of Bergdorf Goodman, outlined progress, as they see it, in the integration, as well as opportunities for the future. Combining the Saks and Neiman’s merchandising and marketing teams into a single organization, from a human capital perspective, is “wholly done,” Metrick said. “They’ve largely been integrated, though there’s always work to do.” He said there’s about a 50-50 split with half the team coming from Neiman’s and half from Saks. Related Articles Fashion Scoops Neiman Marcus Leans Into Elegance for Fall Campaign Retail EXCLUSIVE: Emily Nahas to Head Saks Global E-commerce Data will be key to differentiating from competitors, Metrick emphasized. “We’ve got data on 30 million luxury consumers. We have 700 million visits to our website and record every move that customers make. We understand more and more about this luxury consumer.” You May Also Like Inventory sharing between Saks and Neiman’s will be another competitive advantage, he said. “It’s going to start with online fulfillment, and then it’s going to move into the stores. So you’re looking at every customer that walks into a Saks or Neiman’s store, any size they want, any color they want, any designer they want, anything they want that we have, you’ll have access to.” On store closures, “There’s probably an opportunity to rationalize our fleet,” though it wouldn’t be based on the integration of Saks and Neiman’s, Metrick said. “What you’ll see over the next couple of years is an ordinary course type of closings — nothing on a large scale.” In a past interview, Metrick projected fewer than 10 closings. Already, Saks in Palm Beach closed, and Neiman’s in Dallas has an uncertain future, but remains open at least through the holiday season. Saks Global bought Neiman’s in December. Metrick suggested Saks Global stores have been seriously over-assorted. “I want us to return back to our roots of being that fashion arbiter, that authenticator. Customers have simply too much choice,” he said. “We figured out through hyper-personalization, the exact assortment of product [shoppers] would be interested in when they go onto saks.com. Everyone’s home page at saks.com is personalized. The bottom line is, we have to do more with less.” Saks Global is reducing its vendor matrix by 25 percent with some vendors leaving voluntarily while others are being dropped. Earlier this year, Saks Fifth Avenue launched a storefront on Amazon Luxury Stores, following Amazon’s investment in Saks’ purchase of Neiman’s. It’s a move aimed at boosting the revenues of Saks and some vendor partners, though it poses some risk to hurting the luxury image of Saks and the participating vendors. On the other hand, “There’s an international opportunity with Amazon,” Metrick said. “We’re not thinking about it for 2025 but more as we get into next year and the year after. Amazon is built ready for luxury, globally. There might be opportunities in specific regions and countries,” which could be enticing to brands. Metric acknowledged that much of the conversation surrounding Saks Global has been about late or non-payments to vendors. “I appreciate that and I’m aware it’s caused a lot of pressure and has resulted in noise,” Metrick said. Certain vendors continue to complain about overdue payments, but the CEO said: “We are largely in line with our payments with our brand partners. We need to move on from that part of the conversation and move towards saying, ‘Good news. We’re going to have $600 million in synergies, so now we can pay you.” The expected $600 million in annual savings will come through layoffs, consolidation of functions, and increased buying power over suppliers. Bergdorf Goodman maintains its own buying team, separate from the centralized Saks/Neiman’s organization. “They want to get paid, but that’s not going to excite them,” Metrick added, referring to vendors. “What’s going to excite them is [Saks Global] adding 50 percent of volume over the next five years, through knowing the customer, giving you more space, being more efficient with your inventory, better sell-throughs, and making it more special through events and activations.” While not disclosing any new financial results, Metrick suggested Saks Global is on sounder financial footing, noting the company recently closed on $600 million in financing through a bond exchange with existing holders. “There is north of $2 billion in bonds out there,” Metrick said. With more money available, the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship holiday light show, which was canceled last year to the disappointment of the hundreds of thousands who crowd the streets to see the show each year, is being revived this year and will happen in November, Essner announced. Essner said new Saks Fifth Avenue shop on Amazon was launched “with the hypothesis there’s still an untapped luxury consumer we can access and serve on Amazon. We’ve really found that’s true. The vast majority are new customers, not [those] shopping Saks previously. We are selling true luxury. We’re selling very high price point handbags and dresses in a way that surprised us. And it’s early days. There’s a lot more to build here, but we feel very good with some of the early signals.” About 50 vendors launched with Saks on Amazon. The market has been curious on how Saks Global evolves Saks and Neiman’s and to the degree they differentiate. “We’re being very intentional about this,” Essner said. Saks Fifth Avenue is “really for the fashion enthusiast who is seeking originality, who views Saks Fifth Avenue as their partner in discovery. Neiman Marcus is really for a sophisticate who doesn’t settle.” In terms of items sold, there’s an over 60 percent overlap; the percentage is even higher in terms of brands. Also on Tuesday, Saks Global unveiled its latest Luxury Pulse Survey, which from July 17-21 queried 995 U.S. luxury consumers over age 18. Among the most optimistic of the findings, 56 percent of luxury consumers said they planned to spend the same or more on luxury in August, September and October, compared with the previous three months, representing a 9 percentage-point increase compared with the April survey and nearly flat compared to the same time last year. But that also means that 44 percent of luxury consumers plan to spend less. Whether that all translates into better business for Saks Global this fall depends on how much more, or less, shoppers spend. Saks surveys luxury consumers on a quarterly basis. Based on the July read, Saks does anticipate more spending through October, which Essner attributed to “a desire to treat themselves, which is something we hadn’t seen for a while, as well as feeling better about the overall economy, and their need to update their wardrobes. Some of that might be seasonal. Some of that might be the reality of the fashion coming up, but overall, those were very positive signs.” The survey also found that 32 percent of luxury consumers feel optimistic about the economy, up 4 percentage points compared with the April survey, but 13 percentage points lower than the same time last year. Fifty-nine percent of luxury consumers feel good about their personal finances, 8 percentage points above the April survey, but a 9 point decline from the same time last year. Asked about rising prices, Essner said luxury consumers “are very concerned about value.” That value can be inherent in the craftsmanship and in the design of the product, she said. “The luxury consumer is not necessarily concerned about price.” With tariffs impacting prices, Essner said: “Some brand partners are being thoughtful about their assortments. They’re being thoughtful about pricing, looking potentially in some places to introduce more entry price points as appropriate. In general, what we’re hearing from a tariff perspective is midsingle-digit price increases. That’s very much in line with the increases consumers have seen over the last few years and not going to necessarily stand out.” When querying luxury shoppers in July, Essner said tariffs were not hitting in a big way. “It was a little bit too soon to tell in terms of how, especially the luxury consumer, is going to react, because, frankly, the impact of tariffs isn’t something that they have seen. The bigger concern, the macroeconomic noise generated from all of the tariff discussion.” Looking ahead, Essner noted that recently the saks.com homepage became “a fully personalized experience. We will be taking that capability to neimanmarcus.com and bergdorfgoodman.com.” She also said over 60 percent of the luxury brands Saks Global carries are working on exclusives for the fall season. At Bergdorf Goodman, “We have over 120 events for this fall,” said Margolies. She also said Bergdorf’s, as part of improving its store experience, launched new shops for Tom Ford ready-to-wear and Dior beauty, and will launch a new Schiaparelli shop in the fourth quarter.

The decentralized exchange and layer-1 network is currently being powered by Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT0, but Hyperliquid’s community is currently soliciting proposals on a “Hyperliquid-alinged” stablecoin that could serve as an alternative. Proposals have already been penned by entities including stablecoin issuer Paxos, but Ethena’s proposal emphasizes that its support would also come with that of its partners. Ethena flexed partnerships with Anchorage Digital, a federally chartered digital assets bank, and Securitize, the BlackRock-backed, real-world asset tokenization firm. Anchorage issues Ethena’s USDtb stablecoin, which is backed by BlackRock’s tokenized BUIDL fund. “We are excited to enable Ethena’s USDtb, which is 100% backed by BUIDL and uniquely positioned to offer institutional grade cash management as well as on-chain liquidity to Hyperliquid users,” BlackRock Head of Digital Assets Robert Mitchnick said in the proposal. Introduced in the first quarter of 2023, Hyperliquid was viewed as a scrappy DeFi Startup not too long ago. But now projects like Ethena are clamoring for its feedback, underscoring how that perception is changing. Hyperliquid has $5.7 billion in stablecoins on its network, for example, according to crypto data provider DefiLlama. Under Ethena’s proposal, USDH would be initially backed by USDtb, and therefore have indirect backing from the $14 trillion asset manager’s BUIDL fund. With at least 95% of the revenue generated by USDH’s reserves, distributions would be made to Hyperliquid’s so-called Assistance Fund, alongside HYPE purchases and distributions to validators. HYPE changed hands around $53 on Tuesday, a 20% increase over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The token serves as Hyperliquid’s governance token, letting holders participate in the process of voting on software upgrades and other initiatives. If Ethena receives a green light, the project would cover transaction costs associated with making USDH the go-to stablecoin within Hyperliquid’s exchange, its proposal adds. Among other notable benefits, the proposal states that Anchorage would issue Ethena’s USDtb stablecoin natively on Hyperliquid’s network. On top of that, Securitize would deploy its platform on the layer-1, bringing “institutional grade tokenized funds, stocks, and other financial products to the Hyperliquid ecosystem for no deployment cost.” CORRECTION (September 10, 2025, 12:17 p.m. PT): Removes mention of World Liberty Financial, which is not among the suitors for Hyperliquid's stablecoin.

A project of Common Dreams Phoebe Trotter:ptrotter@fwwatch.org Report pulls punches on pesticide regulation as Congressional Republicans further controversial Cancer Gag legislation This afternoon the White House’s “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) Commission released its strategy report outlining the Trump administration’s priorities for policies to overhaul the food system and address chronic disease. In keeping with White House promises to monied industrial agriculture lobbyists, the report does not endorse increased regulation for toxic pesticides. Fully 71% of Democrats and 66% of Republicans support increasing restrictions on the use of pesticides in agriculture. The report comes as Congressional Republicans further controversial Cancer Gag legislation to shield pesticide manufacturers from health-related lawsuits. The Cancer Gag Act, expected to be reintroduced as the “Agricultural Labeling Uniformity Act,” is reportedly a House Farm Bill priority; House Republicans included related language in a July appropriations vote to prevent EPA from improving pesticide warning labels. Meanwhile, the report makes only passing mention of PFAS – lab-made “forever chemicals” that have been linked to a large range of health problems including various cancers, altered hormone levels, decreased birth weights, digestive inflammation and reduced vaccine response. The Trump administration has been aggressively rolling back previously-established protections for PFAS in drinking water through Lee Zeldin and the Environmental Protection Agency. In response to the release of the report, Food & Water Watch Senior Food Policy Analyst Rebecca Wolf issued the following statement: Food & Water Watch research catalogues pesticide giant Bayer’s multimillion dollar push for Cancer Gag legislation, introduced across the country, failing in nine states and passing in two (the bill is still pending in North Carolina). The push comes as Bayer has spent over $11 billion settling more than 100,000 cancer lawsuits related to its Roundup pesticide, whose key ingredient glyphosate the World Health Organization defines as a probable carcinogen. Food & Water Watch mobilizes regular people to build political power to move bold and uncompromised solutions to the most pressing food, water, and climate problems of our time. We work to protect people's health, communities, and democracy from the growing destructive power of the most powerful economic interests. "This is the latest chapter in the genocide that Israel is committing in Gaza and part of a broader campaign of ethnic cleansing engulfing the entire Gaza Strip," said Oxfam International. Israel's US-backed campaign to ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza City has left nearly 1 million people—half of them starved by design—with nowhere to seek refuge, United Nations agencies and other humanitarian groups warned Wednesday. "We are witnessing a dangerous escalation in Gaza City, where Israeli forces have stepped up their operations and ordered everyone to move south. This comes two weeks after famine was confirmed in the city and surrounding areas," said the UN Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), a strategic forum of UN agency heads and over 200 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). "We're talking about real people who died, real crops that failed, and real communities that suffered, all because of decisions made in corporate boardrooms," said one campaigner. A study published Wednesday in the journal Nature establishing "that the influence of climate change on heatwaves has increased, and that all carbon majors, even the smaller ones, contributed substantially to the occurrence of heatwaves," is fueling fresh calls for fossil fuel giants to pay for the deadly impacts of their products. With previous "attribution studies," scientists have generally looked at single extreme weather events. The new study, led by Sonia Seneviratne, a professor at the Swiss university ETH Zurich, is unique for its systematic approach—but that's not all. “Democracy faces a perfect storm of autocratic resurgence and acute uncertainty," said Kevin Casas-Zamora of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. A new report from a Swedish think tank warns that democracy is backsliding all across the world, led by the US under President Donald Trump. The Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) on Wednesday published findings from its annual Global State of Democracy report that found democracy is declining in 94 countries around the world, representing 54% of all nations the think tank analyzed.

Title: BlackRock Just Sold $192 Million Worth of Ethereum — Has ETH Peaked?

Time Published: 2025-09-09T18:06:26Z

Ethereum ETFs recently witnessed major selling activity as the crypto market remained under pressure overall. The second-largest digital currency by market capitalization experienced a bullish August overall, as the price index witnessed significant appreciation fueled by a buying frenzy from institutional investors. However, the bullish ETF action has cooled considerably in September, and this is reflected in the price index. Ethereum is currently changing hands at around $4.3k at press time. The cryptocurrency has been trading flat around this level for the better part of the last week despite sizable ETF outflows. Here are details of ETF flows for the last 10 days or so: According to the figures from CoinGlass, Ethereum ETFs have witnessed around $1 billion in consecutive outflows since 29 August. In the last two days alone, more than $540 million has been pulled out of these financial instruments, which is generally not a good sign for any underlying asset. BlackRock alone sold $192 million yesterday, while Grayscale witnessed a minor addition of $11 million. Some Ethereum and crypto critics were quick to jump on this prolonged selling spree over at the ETFs as a sign that a bear market is imminent. However, ETFs are only a small portion of the market. Most of the Ethereum is still being bought and sold on cryptocurrency exchanges or held in private wallets. Over there, the situation is opposite. According to one crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), known as The Martini Guy, the premier programmable digital currency is experiencing a record decline on exchanges. He tweeted: “ETHEREUM ON EXCHANGES HAVE DROPPED TO A NEW LOW WHALES ARE BUYING SO MUCH $ETH RIGHT NOW!” His analysis indicates that exchange activity is showing massive Ethereum buying by whales who are snapping it up at relatively cheap prices and taking it offline in their wallets. Conventional wisdom suggests that once these ETH are removed from the exchanges, it helps create a supply shock that benefits the bulls. The stark contrast between ETF activity and exchange activity reveals that two major market forces are at work on these respective platforms, with the former exhibiting a bearish inclination and the latter witnessing bullish action. It remains to be seen which of these two will be able to dominate the market in the coming weeks and months, which are absolutely crucial as we approach the anticipated end of the 2025 bull market.

Title: Ethena enters USDH race supported by BlackRock BUIDL, Anchorage, Securitize

Ethena is committed to returning 95% of net revenue generated from USDH reserves directly to the Hyperliquid community through HYPE token purchases. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethena Labs submitted a proposal on Sept. 9 to become the issuer of Hyperliquid’s native stablecoin USDH, joining an increasingly competitive race. The bid consists of backing USDH entirely by USDtb, a stablecoin backed by BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, with the support of Anchorage Digital. Ethena is committed to returning 95% of net revenue generated from USDH reserves directly to the Hyperliquid community through HYPE token purchases and ecosystem development. Hyperliquid launched the competitive selection process for USDH following a Sept. 5 announcement that the protocol would introduce its native stablecoin in the next network upgrade. The move targets the $5.5 billion in USDC deposits currently serving as the primary settlement currency on the decentralized exchange. The selection carries significant financial implications for Hyperliquid, which currently records nearly $1.3 billion in estimated annualized revenue, according to DefiLlama data. Additionally, the network achieved an all-time high monthly trading volume of $405.8 billion in perpetual contracts during August. Ethena’s proposal differentiates itself through institutional partnerships and proposed security infrastructure. The company plans to establish an elected guardian network of Hyperliquid validators to oversee USDH operations, removing single-issuer control over the stablecoin’s security management. Beyond basic stablecoin issuance, Ethena outlined plans to launch hUSDe, a Hyperliquid-native variant of its synthetic dollar product, and committed $75 million in incentives to support HIP-3 market development.

Stay connected via The firm also announced partnerships with Securitize to deploy tokenized real-world assets on HyperEVM and native USDtb integration. Competing proposals offer distinct approaches to USDH backing and governance. Paxos proposes backing through New York Department of Financial Services-protected accounts with monthly KPMG attestations. Frax Finance plans frUSD backing through treasury partnerships with BlackRock and Superstate. Agora offers short-dated US Treasuries with proof of reserves powered by Chaos Labs. Sky proposes flexible collateral backing through its risk management framework with LayerZero interoperability. The validator-driven selection process requires proposal approval through community governance before proceeding to a gas auction for final deployment rights. Omar Kanji from Dragonfly estimates the transition could generate $220 million in additional annualized revenue for HYPE holders while reducing Circle’s USDC supply by 7%. Ethena emphasized its track record managing over $23 billion in tokenized dollar assets and positioned itself as the largest counterparty capable of supporting Hyperliquid’s expansion into equity perpetual swaps through HIP-3 markets.

Title: The Best And Worst Of Times: AI vs. SaaS for $1 Trillion Market
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/libertbarry/2025/09/09/the-best-and-worst-of-times-----ai-vs-saas-for-1-trillion-market/

ByBarry Libert, Contributor. Every day there are LinkedIn posts, as well as Forbes, NYT, and WSJ articles about the massive capital reallocation by customers and investors to AI from SaaS, foretelling the end of SaaS. Maybe this is right or maybe it is oversold. Who knows? Regardless, if you are a software customer, institutional investor, or even consumer, this tidal wave of migration – from SaaS to AI - is reshaping our world. The question is: What does this mean to you if you are a SaaS leader or investor? In short, this article will answer that question, as well as how to allocate your time and money to be a winner in this emerging market battle for time and money. In 2025, AI spending will approach $650B. You read that number correctly. And if that number doesn’t blow your mind – try this one. AI spending is growing at a mind-bending rate of more than 75% per year. Amazing - right? How about SaaS spending? Our tried-and-true business and investment darling over the past two decades is growing at a little over 18% per year (not too shabby). Stated differently, $300B will be invested this year in SaaS, which is half of the AI spend rate. Given these statistics, it’s clear that a war is emerging for a technological edge, as well as customer and investor dollars. Now that everyone knows what is at stake, the battle lines are being drawn. To understand this battle ground for dollars better, let’s start with the brutal facts that should keep SaaS investors and leaders up at night: What does this mean to you? From my perspective, there are a few emerging trends, about which I have written before, starting with the AI rallying cry - To Be or Not to Be All-In-AI is The Only Question. The AI winners understand this and are attacking traditional SaaS companies on three primary fronts: The brutal question: Is driving 30 MPH the same as driving 100 MPH (think of MPH as analogous to yearly growth rates - 30% CAGR versus 100%). The answer is - definitely not. And for many reasons: different growth rates are dependent on different boards, leaders, products, technologies, cultures, and GTM motions. All of these factors taken together create a dilemma for even the best SaaS leaders and investors. Witness Salesforce’s recent share price performance -- their stock is off nearly 30% – due to a lack of AI preparedness, products, and skills. Given this reality, here are three factors that you need to seriously consider at your next team off-site and board meeting. In short, ask yourself, do you have the right: Workday, Atlassian, Box, HubSpot and Monday, to name just a few SaaS leaders, are now responding - embedding AI everywhere in everything they do. Though they have NOT YET seen a real boost in revenues from their AI spending, they are making hard decisions. To ensure your success, follow these 7 steps: As the CEO of Palantir, Alex Karp says: “The world will be divided between AI haves and have-nots. At Palantir, we plan to power the winners.” The market agrees: Palantir is one of today’s most valuable companies trading at atmospheric heights (>50X revenues). Whether or not you agree with their valuation is not the point. Just see their positioning, product offerings and growth rates and know that we are living a new reality. The Bottom Line: A war is being waged between AI and SaaS for investor and customer dollars. SaaS leaders and investors can still win, but they need to be All-in-AI. There is no time to wait. It’s a high-stakes battle for the future of software customer spending. That is the simple reality of it all. It is up to you as a SaaS leader and investor. Allocate your capital wisely or risk being left behind while also generating sub par financial returns for your people and investors.

Title: Tokenization Scales From Checkout Security to Central Bank Pilots

Highlights Payment tokenization masks card data, slashes fraud and boosts authorization. Asset tokenization enables fractional ownership, instant settlement and 24/7 trading. Central banks and the BIS are modeling tokenized money and unified ledgers. Tokenization has emerged from a niche concept to a strategic imperative across financial services, increasingly underpinning payment security and the trading of real-world assets.

Δ The catch-all moniker might be viewed as shorthand for the secure transmission of information, but use cases differ, and what follows is a primer to shed some light on the finer points of this digital shift. Distinct tracks are developing in parallel: Credit card networks such as Visa and Mastercard convert a card’s primary account number (PAN) into a token. That token is used in place of the real card number across digital wallets, card-on-file providers and in-store NFC payments. Visa now issues billions of tokens, roughly half of global eCommerce transactions are tokenized, with 7% growth in the last quarter alone, bringing total tokens to 15 billion. Visa CEO Ryan McInerney said on a second-quarter 2025 earnings call with analysts in April that tokenization also plays a role in artificial intelligence-facilitated commerce. “Visa Intelligent Commerce … enables consumers to shop and buy with AI agents,” he said. “It combines a suite of integrated APIs, including AI-ready cards with tokenization and authentication, together with a commercial partner program for AI platforms, enabling developers to deploy Visa’s AI commerce capabilities securely and at scale.” Mastercard reported in June that nearly half of its online transactions in Europe are tokenized, and the company is moving toward fully phasing out manual card entries by 2030. Building on this, Mastercard in April unveiled Agent Pay, a product suite embedding programmable token services into agent-led commerce and subscription flows. The initiative positions tokenization as an enabler of new business models, from delegated payments to merchant-agnostic loyalty linking. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization involves turning tangible assets, like real estate, stocks, bonds or commodities, into tradable blockchain tokens. Kraken, BlackRock and R3 are among firms advancing RWA tokenization. Kraken now offers tokenized U.S. equities for eligible non-U.S. clients via offshore subsidiaries, allowing 24/7 trading and settlement. R3 and Solana are collaborating to bring regulated assets on-chain, with R3 reporting over $10 billion in regulated assets already live across its private networks. Tokenization offers benefits: Yet challenges remain: Tokenization is also redefining global money movement. On-chain rails bypass the frictions of correspondent banking and support programmable features like real-time compliance checks. Examples are multiplying. Vera Capital announced in April a partnership with Blocksquare to tokenize commercial real estate, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink declared in a shareholder letter: “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized.” R3 and Solana’s tie-up illustrates this shift. “The future of capital markets will be built on public infrastructure,” Solana Foundation President Lily Liu said, while R3 CEO David E. Rutter called it “a strategic realignment for the entire industry.” Kraken’s launch of xStocks, or tokenized U.S. equities tradable 24/7, demonstrates the leap from pilot to production. Backed one-to-one by custodied shares, these tokens allow fractional ownership and instant settlement. Kraken has since announced multichain expansions, aiming to give investors a choice of blockchain ecosystems while maintaining regulatory compliance. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said tokenized money and assets could reshape monetary policy and payments. A BIS study said a tokenized, unified ledger run by public authorities could replicate stablecoin benefits without private-coin risks. The BIS and Federal Reserve Bank of New York also co-authored experimental work showing how smart contracts might automate liquidity operations and policy transmission. The Federal Reserve is likewise active, hosting workshops and joint research with the BIS on tokenization and payments modernization. Fed staff have stressed the need for interoperable standards on settlement finality, identity and dispute resolution to ensure tokenization scales responsibly. Through Project Pine, which offers a prototypical tokenization “toolkit” to pay interest on reserves, there’s the exploration where “central bank reserves are digital tokens that exist in the token arrangement with other types of money and securities … Above the settlement layer is the ‘asset layer,’ consisting of the wholesale money and securities issued … These tokens represented the reserves, commercial bank deposits, securities and unsecuritized assets that would be used in testing scenarios.” Together, these projects underscore how public authorities aim to integrate tokenization into regulated infrastructures while private firms race ahead with commercial deployments.

Title: Morgan Stanley flags 3 cybersecurity stocks poised to rally as threats increase and IT spending jumps

Morgan Stanley says a few cybersecurity firms are primed for further upside as companies pump money into streamlined security platforms. The share prices of Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, and Zscaler should all get a boost in the coming 12 months, the bank's software equity research team said in a note earlier this month. The three companies are best-positioned for a mega wave of "platformization" for cybersecurity products, with firms looking to integrate and simplify their cyber-defense structures. All three of the stocks offer solutions across multiple parts of the security chain, like devices, cloud, applications, and networks. "We expect platformization to continue as security needs grow against tight budgets, environments get more complex, a problem that only gets worse with AI," analyst Meta A. Marshall, the lead author of the note, wrote. Morgan Stanley expects the $270 billion cybersecurity market to grow by about 12% a year over the next few years. The bank also cited its CIO survey data showing that firms intend to spend 50% more on cybersecurity products than general software products in the years ahead as a reason to be bullish. On Morgan Stanley's list of 15 software stocks to watch, two key drivers of forward returns are revenue growth (for long-term returns) and free-cash flow margins (for short-term performance), the bank said. Among those on the list, the median projected revenue growth is 11.8% and the median projected free cash flow margin is 26.6%. Palo Alto Networks has projected revenue growth of 13.6% for next year and 38.3% projected free cash flow margins, part of the reason that Morgan Stanley has an "Overweight" rating on the stock. As of September 2, the stock has 9% implied upside to its price target, the bank said, and 36% upside in its bull case scenario. "In our view, Palo Alto Networks should be one of the few leading platform vendors in security longer-term, especially as the platformization strategy continues to gain momentum and more security vendors consolidate," the bank said of the firm. For shares of CrowdStrike, which MS gives an "Equal Weight" rating, the bank sees 9% upside as a base case and 30% upside in its bull case. Its projected revenue growth is 21.5% and its projected free cash flow margin is 31%. Finally, Zscaler, which the bank recently upgraded to an "Overweight" rating, should climb 16% to the bank's price target, it said. Its bull-case scenario is a 44% gain. Its revenue is projected to grow by 18.3% and its projected free cash flow margin is 27.3%. "We think ZS could cement itself as the next true platform (along with PANW and CRWD)," the bank said.

Title: NVIDIA Unveils Rubin CPX: A New Class of GPU Designed for Massive-Context Inference

September 09, 2025 11:12 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SANTA CLARA, Calif., Sept. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AI Infra Summit -- NVIDIA® today announced NVIDIA Rubin CPX, a new class of GPU purpose-built for massive-context processing. This enables AI systems to handle million-token software coding and generative video with groundbreaking speed and efficiency. Rubin CPX works hand in hand with NVIDIA Vera CPUs and Rubin GPUs inside the new NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX platform. This integrated NVIDIA MGX system packs 8 exaflops of AI compute to provide 7.5x more AI performance than NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems, as well as 100TB of fast memory and 1.7 petabytes per second of memory bandwidth in a single rack. A dedicated Rubin CPX compute tray will also be offered for customers looking to reuse existing Vera Rubin 144 systems. “The Vera Rubin platform will mark another leap in the frontier of AI computing — introducing both the next-generation Rubin GPU and a new category of processors called CPX,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Just as RTX revolutionized graphics and physical AI, Rubin CPX is the first CUDA GPU purpose-built for massive-context AI, where models reason across millions of tokens of knowledge at once.” NVIDIA Rubin CPX enables the highest performance and token revenue for long-context processing — far beyond what today’s systems were designed to handle. This transforms AI coding assistants from simple code-generation tools into sophisticated systems that can comprehend and optimize large-scale software projects. To process video, AI models can take up to 1 million tokens for an hour of content, pushing the limits of traditional GPU compute. Rubin CPX integrates video decoder and encoders, as well as long-context inference processing, in a single chip for unprecedented capabilities in long-format applications such as video search and high-quality generative video.

Nebius Group shares jumped Tuesday after the Amsterdam-based AI infrastructure provider said it has inked an agreement with Microsoft worth up to $19.4 billion over five years. Under the deal, Nebius (NBIS) will deliver computing resources to Microsoft (MSFT) later this year using a data center in New Jersey, helping the Azure owner address a demand shortage for cloud infrastructure that can process increasing AI workloads. CEO Arkady Volozh said it’s the first time Nebius had signed a long-term contract with a large tech company, and added that there are likely more to come. Nebius stock was up 37% at $88 in recent trading after hitting an all-time high near $98 in the opening minutes of the session. The stock has more than tripled since the start of 2025, boosted in part by news AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA) had taken a stake in the company. Below we analyze the technicals on the Nebius chart and identify major price levels worth watching out for after the stock’s big move today. After climbing to their highest level in more than three years last month, Nebius shares had consolidated in a pennant, a chart pattern that signals a bullish continuation upon a breakout to the upside. That move higher took place on Tuesday, setting the stage for potential follow-through buying. Interestingly, prior to today’s surge, the relative strength index bottomed around its neutral reading, the same level that coincided with the end of a dip in early July. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast a potential bullish price target to monitor and also point out major support levels worth watching during potential retracements. Investors can forecast a bullish price target by using the measured move technique, a study that analyzes chart patterns to project future price movements. When applying the analysis to the Nebius chart, we measure the percentage change of the steep uptrend from May to August that preceded the pennant and add it to the pattern’s top trendline value, assuming a similar continuation move may play out in the months ahead. For example, we apply a 145% increase to $72, which projects a target of $176.40—implying that the stock could more than double from Monday’s closing price. During retracements, investors should initially watch the $87 level. The stock could be snapped up at this level by investors looking for entry points on a retest of the prominent November 2021 peak, which also marks the stock’s prior all-time high. A close below this level could see the shares fall to support near $76. This area may provide support around the top of the pennant, which also corresponds with a period of trading activity on the chart between September and October 2021. Finally, a more-significant drop in Nebius shares could bring lower support at $54 into play. Investors may seek buying opportunities at this location near the February 2022 countertrend peak and a range of sideways price action on the chart that preceded a notable stock gap last month.

Title: Impact of digital technology on herders’ grassland leasing-in decisions in Inner Mongolia, China

Against the backdrop of grassland ecological degradation, grassland transfer has become a crucial pathway for optimizing livestock resource allocation and promoting sustainable pastoral development. Based on survey data from 383 herder households in the farming–pastoral ecotone of Inner Mongolia, China, this study applies Heckman models, mediation models, and moderation models to examine the impact of digital technology on herders’ grassland leasing-in decisions and the underlying mechanisms. The results indicate that digital technology significantly increases both the probability and the scale of grassland leasing-in among herders. Moreover, digital technology indirectly promotes grassland leasing-in by enhancing scale efficiency. Notably, strong social networks weaken the facilitating role of digital technology in grassland transfer, whereas weak social networks strengthen it. The impact of digital technology on grassland leasing-in is especially pronounced under environmental regulations with weak incentives but strong constraints. Finally, compared with ordinary herders, digital technology has a significantly positive effect on grassland leasing-in only for new-type operators. In addition, the impact of digital technology is more pronounced among groups with higher levels of education.

Grasslands are among the most widely distributed vegetation types worldwide [1], covering about 40% of the global land area (excluding Antarctica and Greenland) and supporting the livelihoods of nearly one billion people [2]. They perform critical ecological functions, including soil and water conservation, water source retention, and biodiversity protection. Grasslands also act as ecological barriers closely connected to socioeconomic development and regional ecological security [3,4]. They perform critical ecological functions, including soil and water conservation, water source retention, and biodiversity protection. China boasts abundant grassland resources, with its prairie area accounting for approximately 12% of the global total, ranking first in the world [5]. According to data from the Third National Land Survey, grassland area is second only to forest land, making it the second largest land use type in China, covering about 27.56% of the national territory. Consequently, they constitute the largest terrestrial ecosystem in the country [6,7]. However, weak management systems and increasing human disturbances have created severe ecological challenges [8], including shrinking grassland area, declining quality, reduced grazing capacity, and further degradation such as desertification and salinization [9]. Statistics show that nearly 90% of China’s usable natural grasslands have degraded, expanding at a rate of two million hectares annually [10]. Facing these impacts, grassland remains the fundamental resource for herders’ livelihoods. Grassland transfer is a key mechanism for optimizing resource allocation in animal husbandry [11]. Since the reform era, the household contract responsibility system has led to resource misallocation across labor, grassland, livestock, and productive assets [12]. To address resource scarcity and improve production efficiency, the grassland transfer system emerged [13], currently referring mainly to the transfer of grassland management or usage rights [11]. Therefore, in this study, “grassland leasing-in” refers to the practice whereby a herder leases-in grassland from another right holder—via formal contractual arrangements or informal agreements—to acquire grassland management rights. Compared with farming households, herders face more severe resource imbalances, making grassland transfer a vital means to balance resources, break the cycle of degradation and poverty, and promote sustainable development in grassland-based animal husbandry [12]. Herders’ grassland transfer behaviors typically take three forms: non-participation, leasing-in, and leasing-out. In theory, herders engage in land transactions to improve welfare [14]. Leasing-in occurs when herders rent additional grassland to achieve scale economies and higher profits [15], while leasing-out often reflects unstable livestock income and the attraction of stable subsidies, rent, or off-farm employment [12,16]. Non-participation may result from constraints such as limited capital [17–20], ecological concerns [21,22], subsidy policies [23], high transaction costs [24], perceived risks [25], or incomplete markets [19]. A notable emerging constraint is the digital divide, which limits herders’ access to digital tools and platforms that could facilitate transactions. Digital technologies can address these barriers by reducing transaction costs, improving information flow, and enabling off-farm employment [26]. This aligns with broader research on agricultural land transfer, which highlights four mechanisms: reducing transaction costs through digital platforms, enhancing social capital via virtual networks, mitigating information asymmetry, and facilitating labor reallocation to non-agricultural sectors [27,28]. Together, these mechanisms are reshaping traditional patterns of pastoral resource allocation. Despite this progress, several research gaps remain. First, little attention has been paid to the relationship between digital technology and grassland leasing-in, as most studies focus on farmland transfer. Second, existing analyses emphasize information acquisition, while the efficiency-enhancing role of digital technology remains unexplored. Third, because grassland ecosystems are fragile, grassland transfer is strongly influenced by policy, suggesting that the effect of digital technology may vary across institutional contexts. Fourth, differences in resource endowments among production entities lead to divergent transfer behaviors, but few studies examine how digital technology affects these differences. To address these gaps, this study focuses on four key questions: What impact does digital technology have on grassland leasing-in? What role does scale efficiency play in this relationship? Does the effect depend on social networks? Does the impact of digital technology vary with external environments and herders’ characteristics? Exploring these questions is crucial for advancing digital rural construction and transforming animal husbandry development models. According to Schultz’s theory, the introduction of modern production factors is essential for transforming traditional agriculture [29]. As a new production factor, digital technology provides abundant data for pastoral production, streamlines information acquisition [30], enables rapid dissemination and integration of agricultural and pastoral information [31], and supports herders’ grassland leasing-in decisions by improving information availability. This reduces information asymmetry [32,33], lowers information costs, and thereby facilitates grassland transfer. More importantly, digital technology leverages data as a new production factor to exert its enabling function [34]. In animal husbandry, it represents an innovation in production methods, shifting the dominant mode of production from reliance on manual labor to intelligent machinery. Traditionally, livestock rearing requires extensive manual intervention, which constrains the scale of operations. Theoretically, enabling fewer people to manage larger herds could overcome the main bottleneck to higher output and profitability [35]. Digital technology addresses this constraint by replacing routine, repetitive, and some non-routine tasks, generating a substitution effect [36]. This shift from mechanization to intelligent systems reduces labor intensity and expands the management scope and capacity of each laborer. For example, real-time livestock tracking reduces the time spent locating animals, while remote herd monitoring minimizes unnecessary labor inputs. As a result, with equal or even reduced labor input, herders can manage larger herds, overcome scale bottlenecks, reduce management costs, and enhance scale efficiency. Improved scale efficiency further lowers unit production costs and substantially increases expected returns from expansion. Based on the rational-economic agent assumption, herders are therefore more likely to lease in grassland to expand production and pursue higher returns. However, adopting digital technology also involves risks—such as data tampering, cyberattacks, and unauthorized access—that may undermine operational integrity and reduce expected gains without sufficient safeguards. As Yazdinejad et al. [37] note, smart farming and precision agriculture systems face increasing security threats, requiring robust countermeasures such as encryption, intrusion detection, and secure communication protocols. Furthermore, while enhancing scale efficiency, digital technology also mitigates livestock disease and management risks, strengthening herders’ confidence in leasing-in and managing grassland. Ultimately, it improves managerial capacity and cost advantages, potentially increasing future demand for additional grassland to exploit scale economies. Based on this theoretical analysis, the following hypotheses are proposed: H1:‌ Digital technology positively facilitates herders’ grassland leasing-in behavior. H2:‌ Digital technology indirectly promotes herders’ grassland leasing-in behavior by enhancing scale efficiency. Social relationships include both strong ties and weak ties. Strong ties usually exist between individuals with frequent interaction and close relationships, often yielding repetitive or redundant information. By contrast, weak ties connect individuals with diverse socio-economic characteristics, such as different experiences, knowledge, and backgrounds, and are generally superior in providing novel, effective, and non-redundant information [38]. A key function of social networks in grassland transfer is information acquisition. Herders obtain policy information and grassland-related details from their social networks. As a non-market pathway, social networks disseminate policy information and help herders understand other stakeholders’ perspectives. The larger the social network, the more diverse the information herders can access [39]. In information-scarce pastoral areas, choosing transaction partners based on personal relationships is the primary way to mitigate risks [40]. The main advantage of strong social networks is their emotional support, which constrains both parties, reduces contract breaches and land degradation, lowers moral hazard and transaction costs, and has historically supported grassland transfer processes [41]. However, with the development of digital technology, the role of strong social networks may be declining. Digital technology reduces information asymmetry, enabling impersonal transactions, and also provides formal contract safeguards, reducing dependence on relational contracts. Unlike strong ties, weak-tie networks connect groups with different education levels, incomes, and ages, giving them a comparative advantage in accessing non-redundant information. When informal reciprocity cannot meet herders’ demand for grassland resources and expansion, they must seek additional lease information, and the “information bridge” function of weak ties becomes critical [42]. However, transactions in weak-tie networks often require institutional safeguards [43]. Without digital tools, herders with sparse social ties lack institutional support, hindering independent transfers. Conversely, effective use of digital tools can fill these institutional gaps by providing information exchange and formal safeguards, even for sparsely connected herders or transactions between strangers, thereby promoting grassland leasing-in through weak-tie networks. Thus, different social networks may moderate the effect of digital technology on grassland leasing-in in distinct ways. Based on this theoretical analysis, we propose: H3:‌ Strong social networks weaken, whereas weak social networks strengthen, the positive effect of digital technology on grassland leasing-in. The adoption and diffusion of technology are widely recognized as being shaped by individuals’ educational attainment [44]. Theoretically, herders with higher education generally have stronger abilities in acquiring and processing information, which enables them to better use digital platforms—for example, for online leasing, price comparison, and contract signing. Empirical research supports this view: farmers with higher education show greater willingness to adopt smart agricultural technologies [45]. These cognitive advantages allow them to use digital tools more effectively in practice. By contrast, herders with lower education often face barriers to adopting and applying digital technologies. The higher cognitive costs of understanding tools, operating platforms, or evaluating risks may cause reluctance or mistrust, thereby reducing the utility of these technologies. Consequently, higher education is likely to enhance the positive impact of digital technology on grassland transfer decisions. At the same time, leasing behaviors are also shaped by other individual characteristics and external policy environments [46–49]. In recent years, China’s livestock production system has shifted from traditional household contracting to new-type operators—such as large-scale households, family ranches, cooperatives, and livestock enterprises—which has accelerated grassland transfer [50]. This is mainly because, first, unlike ordinary herders, new-type operators earn most of their income from livestock production, prioritize long-term development, and typically require large-scale land transfers to meet specialized production needs [51,52]. By contrast, ordinary herders increasingly diversify their livelihoods and engage in pluriactivity [53,54]. According to comparative advantage theory, they reduce labor input in livestock production, focus less on long-term benefits, and prefer to increase non-pastoral income, thereby reducing their likelihood of leasing-in grassland [55,56]. Second, as market-oriented organizations [57], new-type operators have stronger risk-bearing capacity than ordinary herders, who are constrained by subsistence and risk aversion, thereby increasing the probability of leasing-in. Third, higher intensification among new-type operators their adoption of digital technologies, further increasing the probability of leasing-in [58]. Fourth, contiguous operations among new-type operators optimize production efficiency, further increasing incentives for leasing-in. Moreover, intensified economic activities place substantial pressure on grassland ecosystems [59]. In response, China implemented the Grassland Ecological Compensation Awards (GECA) policy to protect grassland ecology. As the world’s largest ecological compensation program in coverage and beneficiaries, GECA reshapes herders’ expected returns from grasslands and alters their land management strategies [60]. Under grassland degradation, GECA focuses on livestock reduction and grazing bans through incentive and restrictive instruments: restrictive policies impose economic or reputational penalties on non-compliant herders to increase violation costs, while incentive policies provide subsidies to offset losses and externalities from destocking, thereby stabilizing economic expectations. As a result, herders’ leasing-in behavior shows heterogeneity under different environmental regulations. Specifically, when subsidies fail to cover the opportunity costs of destocking, herders cannot rely on compensation alone, making leasing-in a rational choice for profit. At the same time, strict penalties for overstocking raise the marginal costs of non-compliance, compelling herders to acquire grassland legally to avoid penalties. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis H4:‌ The impact of digital technology on grassland leasing-in is heterogeneous. This study develops a conceptual framework examining digital technology’s impact on grassland transfer (Fig 1). Source: Prepared by the authors based on the study’s conceptual design.

The study sites lie in the agro-pastoral ecotone of the southern Greater Khingan Mountains and include Keshiketeng, Bairin Right, Bairin Left, Ongniud, and Ar Horqin Banners. Minors were excluded from the survey population. Before data collection, all participants were informed of the research purpose and provided written consent, confirming voluntary participation. The project was approved by the School Research Ethics Panel of the corresponding institution (approval code: NNDKY2024004). A stratified random sampling design was adopted at the sumu (township) level, covering 31 sampled sumu. Within each stratum, interviewers randomly selected household identifiers from updated administrative rosters of registered herder households provided by local authorities. One adult decision-maker from each household was interviewed face-to-face. The target sample was proportionally allocated across strata according to the number of registered herder households, ensuring representativeness across banners and sumu. After fieldwork, records were screened using a pre-specified protocol. Following rigorous quality checks, 29 questionnaires were excluded due to critical errors, substantial missing values, or extreme outliers that could not be corrected. These excluded cases were distributed across different townships and did not cluster in any specific category of herders, minimizing the risk of systematic bias. The remaining 383 valid questionnaires produced an effective response rate of 93%. Two primary sources of potential bias are recognized. First, non-response and temporary unavailability during peak husbandry activities may bias the sample toward time-constrained households. This was mitigated by scheduling visits outside peak hours when possible and conducting in-person callbacks. In the empirical analysis, household and operational controls as well as township fixed effects were also included. Second, differences in comprehension, especially among older or less educated respondents, may cause measurement errors. To minimize such errors, trained interviewers explained questionnaire items in detail. Econometric analyses using Heckman and IV-Heckman specifications, along with robustness checks, confirmed that the main results remained robust. This region was selected for two reasons. First, the third national land survey shows that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has about 81.56 million hectares of grassland, accounting for 20.56% of China’s total and 46% of the region’s landmass. Of this, natural pasture covers 71.88 million hectares, artificial pasture 1.91 million hectares, and other types 9.49 million hectares. The grassland ecosystem is highly diverse, with eight major categories, 21 subcategories, and 476 types, forming a rich repository of natural resources. Surveying this area thus provides comprehensive and representative herder samples. Second, as a key agro-pastoral transition zone, it is one of China’s most ecologically vulnerable and poverty-concentrated areas [61,62], making it particularly relevant for studying grassland transfer. The distribution of the survey area is shown in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.g002 Grassland leasing-in is a two-stage decision process: first, deciding whether to lease-in grassland, and second, determining the transfer area. Sample selection bias may arise because some herders who wish to lease-in may abstain due to individual constraints. Consequently, only samples that exhibit leasing-in behavior provide observable area data. To address this issue, the Heckman model is employed. Stage 1: Transfer Participation Decision A probit regression models herders’ binary transfer decision using fitted values and residuals of digital technology variables alongside exogenous covariates: where denotes the grassland leasing-in decision (1 = yes; 0 = no), represents digital technology variables, is a vector of control variables, denotes the intercept, and are parameter estimates, and is the stochastic error term. Stage 2: Transfer Area Determination An OLS regression estimates the transfer area using fitted values and residuals of digital technology-related variables with exogenous predictors: where indicates the grassland leasing-in area, and are as previously defined, is the intercept, and are parameters, denotes the error term. In the Heckman model, technology promotion is used as the identifying variable. It affects herders’ decisions to lease-in grassland but does not directly influence the scale of leasing. The rationale is that agricultural technology extension is a key policy instrument for knowledge dissemination [63]. When organized by local governments, such campaigns change herders’ perceptions [64], and improved cognition is expected to generate more rational behavioral responses [65]. Existing studies also show that cognitive levels significantly influence farmers’ willingness to engage in land transfer [66]. However, without sufficient capital and labor, exposure to technology promotion alone cannot increase the feasible scale of leased grassland. Thus, technical publicity satisfies the relevance conditions for influencing participation in leasing without directly affecting the leased-in area. Nevertheless, the above estimations may still suffer from endogeneity issues arising from omitted variables, measurement errors, or reverse causality. To address this concern, the present study employs the IV-Heckman model to overcome potential sample endogeneity. Following prior research [67], we use the “digital technology adoption rate within the same sumu (township)” as an instrumental variable for individual adoption. The rationale is twofold: first, the township-level adoption rate is highly correlated with individual adoption, as herders within the same township face similar livestock production environments and share common infrastructure. Second, conditional on control variables, township-level averages do not directly determine an individual household’s leasing scale or decision, which depend on household-specific resources and preferences. Hence, this variable satisfies both the relevance and exogeneity requirements for a valid instrument. Theoretical analysis suggests that digital technology may indirectly affect grassland leasing-in decisions through the mediating channel of scale efficiency. To test this mechanism empirically, we apply the causal mediation framework developed by Baron and Kenny [68] and extended by Wen [69]. Given the binary nature of the dependent variable, we use the nonparametric bootstrap procedure for mediation testing proposed by Preacher [70], which accommodates dichotomous outcomes without distributional assumptions. where denote the mediator variable (scale efficiency), denotes the grassland leasing-in decision, represents digital technology variables, and is a vector of control variable. To empirically assess the moderating role of social networks, the baseline model is augmented with interaction terms between digital technology and strong or weak social networks. The formal specification is as follows: Here, denote strong and weak social networks of herder household. Following previous studies [27], grassland transfer decisions are measured using two indicators: (i) a binary variable for leasing-in participation, and (ii) a continuous variable for the acquired grassland area. Digital technology is the primary explanatory variable. Despite improvements in network infrastructure in agro-pastoral regions, a secondary digital divide has emerged. This divide reflects competence gaps in using digital devices, retrieving information, and engaging in online marketing, and has become a major constraint limiting herders’ access to digital benefits [71]. To quantify digital technology use in livestock production, we employ a binary indicator based on herders’ self-reported adoption of digital technologies (e.g., video monitoring, traceability systems, positioning devices, drones, or smart feeding systems). Households that adopt at least one technology are coded as 1, and non-adopters as 0. Scale efficiency is the mediating variable. It is derived from Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) using DEAP 2.1 software, based on an input-oriented model with variable returns to scale (VRS). Inputs include pastureland (operated grassland area), labor (hired and family labor valued in monetary terms), and capital expenditures (forage, breeding services, fuel, fixed-asset depreciation, and other inputs), consistent with previous studies [72]. The output variable is the total pastoral production value. The moderating variables are strong and weak social networks. Strong ties mainly derive from kinship, close friends, and familiar neighbors, and their maintenance requires substantial gift-giving and ritual obligations [39]. Accordingly, “interpersonal expenditure” is used as the proxy for strong social network [73]. Weak ties lack strong emotional bonds, and “communication expenditure” effectively captures households’ access to broader information [74]. Consistent with prior studies, communication expenditure serves as the proxy for weak social network [75]. The model controls for pastoral household characteristics, operational attributes, and geographic heterogeneity. Individual characteristics encompass household head’s age, health status, education, and political status; household traits include dependency ratio, non-pastoral employment, per capita livestock income, and livestock income share; operational features control for per capita grassland area, per capita livestock scale, barn-feeding duration, and unit production cost. In addition, township-level dummy variables are included to capture regional fixed effects. Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the key variables. Overall, about 16% of pastoral households participated in grassland transfer, with an average transferred area of 218 mu. In addition, 39% of households adopted digital technologies in production. For individual characteristics, household heads had an average age of 49 years, generally reported good health, and attained an education level equivalent to junior high school, with only a small proportion serving as village cadres. For household characteristics, families showed relatively low dependency ratios and a clear trend toward non-pastoral livelihoods. Per capita livestock income averaged 55,200 yuan, with livestock husbandry remaining the primary income source. From an operational perspective, households managed an average per capita grassland area of 310 mu and held 96 sheep-equivalent units per capita. Barn-feeding was the predominant rearing method and was associated with higher unit production costs. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t001 Table 2 reports the baseline results on the impact of digital technology on grassland leasing-in. In Columns (1) and (2), the coefficients of digital technology are positive and statistically significant at the 10% and 5% levels, respectively. The average marginal effect in Column (1) is 0.0619, implying that households using digital technology are 6% more likely to participate in grassland leasing-in than non-users. Column (2) further shows that adopters lease in about 509 more mu of grassland. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t002 Columns (3) and (4) address endogeneity from reverse causality and sample selection. Results indicate that the coefficients of digital technologies remain positive and significant. The Wald test is significant at the 1% level, and the first-stage F-statistic is 31.97, confirming instrument validity. This confirms that digital technology promotes grassland leasing-in even after controlling for endogeneity. Hence, Hypothesis 1 is validated: digital technologies significantly increases both the likelihood of grassland leasing-in and the transferred area. Among personal characteristics, age negatively affects the transferred area. Older households tend to prioritize livelihood stability, and acquiring larger areas involves greater uncertainties and risks. Reduced labor capacity with age also leads households to retain contracted grasslands for subsistence instead of expanding through transfers. Political status exerts a positive effect, since village cadre household heads have greater access and capacity to acquire grassland. Regarding household characteristics, a higher livestock income share reduces the transferred area. One possible explanation is that more specialized pastoral households typically practice stall-feeding for longer durations, thereby reducing their demand for transferred grassland area. For operational characteristics, per capita grassland area positively affects transfer-in, whereas confinement feeding duration and unit production costs exert negative effects. Longer confinement reduces grazing demand, while higher costs economically constrain households and limit expansion. To further address potential sample selection bias, the propensity score matching (PSM) method was employed. As reported in Table 3, the PSM results show that households adopting digital technologies lease in about 123 more units of grassland. These findings confirm the robustness of the baseline estimates. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t003 To further validate the reliability of the PSM estimates, a balance test was conducted, and the outcomes are reported in Table 4. As shown in Table 4, most standardized biases were substantially reduced after matching, with all falling below the 20% threshold [76]. Furthermore, post-matching t-tests for all covariates were insignificant, confirming that the assumptions of common support and balance were satisfied. These results further confirm the robustness of the estimates. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t004 Following prior methodology [77], this study uses grassland rent as an alternative measure of grassland leasing-in and applies a Tobit regression model for robustness testing. The results reported in Table 5 indicate that the coefficients of digital technology remain significantly positive under this specification, thereby reinforcing the robustness of the baseline findings. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t005 A broader range of digital technology tools adopted by herders indicates a higher level of digital technology adoption. Accordingly, this study replaces the primary explanatory variable with the number of digital technology tool types as an alternative measure and re-estimates the baseline model. The results in Table 6 show that, under this specification, the diversity of digital technology tools has a significantly positive effect on both grassland leasing-in participation and transferred area, thereby reinforcing the robustness of the previous results. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t006 Since a lower proportion of livestock income in total household income indicates reduced reliance on pastoral activities—which may lead to more discretionary grassland leasing decisions [27]—this study conducts a robustness test by excluding households with livestock income shares below 20%. The models and control variables remain unchanged for re-estimation. The results show that, even after sample exclusion, digital technology continues to exert significantly positive effects on both grassland leasing-in participation and transferred area, thereby confirming the robustness of the regression outcomes (Table 7). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t007 Table 8 presents the results of the mediation analysis for scale efficiency. The estimates indicate that digital technologies significantly improve scale efficiency at the 1% level, with adoption increasing scale efficiency by approximately 0.07 units relative to non-adopters. Scale efficiency also exerts a significantly positive impact on grassland leasing-in decisions at the 1% level, suggesting that improvements in efficiency substantially increase the likelihood of leasing-in. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t008 The mediation test shows that the confidence interval of the indirect effect excludes zero, whereas that of the direct effect includes zero, confirming a statistically significant indirect effect but an insignificant direct effect. These results confirm that digital technologies influence herders’ leasing-in decisions indirectly through scale efficiency, with the mediation effect accounting for 26.21% of the total effect. The proposed pathway “Digital Technology → Scale Efficiency → Grassland Leasing-In” is empirically supported. Mechanistically, digital tools substitute for traditional herding methods, thereby reducing management costs and enhancing scale efficiency. Higher scale efficiency allows herders to achieve greater output per unit of input, which in turn incentivizes grassland leasing-in. Overall, these findings provide robust empirical evidence supporting Hypothesis 2. Prior to empirical estimation, the variables of strong and weak social networks were mean-centered to mitigate multicollinearity [78]. Table 9 reports the estimation results for the moderating effects of social networks. The results show that strong social networks have a significantly positive coefficient at the 5% level, whereas their interaction with digital technologies is significantly negative at the same level. This implies that although traditional strong ties enhance the probability of leasing-in, their facilitating role diminishes once herders adopt digital technologies. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t009 By contrast, weak social networks display insignificant direct effects, yet their interaction with digital technologies is significantly positive at the 5% level. This suggests that although weak ties alone do not foster leasing-in decisions, digital technologies unlock their latent value for adopters. The mechanism operates through two complementary channels: digital technologies enhance herders’ management capacity, while weak social networks supply critical information on leasing opportunities. This technological–informational complementarity generates synergistic effects that substantially facilitate leasing-in decisions. Overall, these findings provide robust empirical support for Hypothesis 3. We further examine whether the impact of digital technologies on grassland leasing-in differs across varying intensities of environmental regulation. To address sample size constraints, households were split into two subsamples—above-mean and below-mean groups—so as to ensure statistical robustness. Following the implementation outcomes of the grassland ecological subsidy and reward policy, herders with grazing ban enforcement intensity above the mean were classified as the “strong-restriction” group, whereas those below the mean comprised the “weak-restriction” group. Likewise, herders with grazing ban incentives above the mean were labeled as the “strong-incentive” group, while those below the mean were categorized as the “weak-incentive” group. To estimate the probability of leasing-in participation, a Probit regression model was employed, given its suitability for binary dependent variables. As shown in Table 10, digital technologies exert a significantly positive effect on grassland leasing-in within the weak-incentive group. Specifically, column (2) shows that a one-unit increase in digital technology adoption raises the probability of leasing-in participation by 9.50%. In contrast, the effect is statistically insignificant for the strong-incentive group. Likewise, in the strong-restriction group, digital technology adoption exerts a significantly positive effect: column (8) indicates that each additional unit of adoption increases the probability of leasing-in by 9.52%. By contrast, the effect remains insignificant for the weak-restriction group. Taken together, these findings underscore that the effect of digital technologies on leasing-in is conditional on the regulatory context. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t010 This heterogeneity can be interpreted as follows. Under weak incentives—where subsidies fail to offset economic losses from grazing bans—digital technologies allow herders to expand production by leasing additional grasslands, thereby compensating for subsidy shortfalls. Under strong restrictions, where grassland scarcity is exacerbated, digital technologies assist herders in acquiring legal grazing rights through leasing, thereby enabling compliance while optimizing resource allocation. We further distinguish between two categories of production entities: new-type operators and ordinary herders. Respondents were classified as new-type operators if they were professional large-scale households, family ranch managers, or members of specialized herders’ cooperatives, while all others were categorized as ordinary herders. Since this study focuses on individual households and data on leading enterprises and agricultural service organizations are scarce, the definition of new-type operators is confined to the three groups mentioned above. Based on the Probit model, results reported in Table 11 indicate that the coefficient of digital technology adoption for new-type operators is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level. The marginal effect estimates further suggest that a one-unit increase in digital adoption raises the probability of grassland leasing-in by 11%. By contrast, the effect for ordinary herders remains statistically insignificant. These findings highlight the heterogeneous impact of digital technology adoption across different types of production entities. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t011 Since herders with different educational backgrounds vary in their ability to absorb new knowledge, technologies, and ideas, their production decisions may also differ accordingly. Based on the sample characteristics, households with more than nine years of education (above junior high school) were classified as the high-education group, while those with nine years or less (junior high school and below) were defined as the low-education group. The regression results are presented in Table 12. For the high-education group, digital technology adoption exerts a significant positive effect on grassland leasing-in. The marginal effect estimates suggest that a one-unit increase in adoption raises the probability of leasing-in by 11.76%. By contrast, the effect for the low-education group is statistically insignificant. These findings highlight the benefits of digital technology adoption are greater among more educated herders and provide empirical support for Hypothesis 4 (Table 12). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t012 This study provides a systematic examination of the multiple pathways through which digital technologies influence herders’ decisions to lease in grassland. The empirical analysis demonstrates that such technologies not only exert a direct positive effect on the likelihood and scale of grassland leasing but also generate indirect benefits through the mediating role of scale efficiency. By enabling herders to overcome constraints on operational expansion and to optimize the allocation of production factors, digital adoption helps break through traditional bottlenecks. The analytical framework also incorporates multidimensional contextual factors—such as social networks, environmental regulations, the type of production entity and educational level—to reveal the multifaceted nature of digital transformation in pastoral regions. Further evidence suggests that the interaction between digital technologies and social networks is not uniform. In settings characterized by strong social networks, the traditional advantages of these networks tend to weaken in the digital era; conversely, in weaker networks, digital tools can unlock considerable latent value. This finding expands the research perspective on the interplay between social capital and technology adoption, implying that digitalization may reshape the structure of social capital in pastoral communities. The heterogeneous effects associated with environmental regulation further reveal that the influence of digital technologies is more pronounced in contexts where incentives are limited yet regulatory constraints are strong, highlighting the critical role of institutional environments in shaping technological impacts. Moreover, the benefits of digital adoption are found to be concentrated primarily among new types of production entities. This indicates that the digital divide in pastoral areas is rooted less in access to technology per se than in disparities in organizational capacity and specialization—an imbalance that, to some extent, runs counter to the inclusive development goals of current policy. The contributions of this study are twofold. Theoretically, it develops and empirically validates a “digital technology–scale efficiency–grassland leasing” pathway model, elucidating the moderating roles of social networks and institutional environments, and thereby enriching the research framework linking digital technologies with land transfer processes. Practically, the findings offer targeted guidance for formulating differentiated policies for digital pastoralism: on one hand, technology promotion strategies should be tailored to match varying social network structures and institutional conditions; on the other, policy should focus on narrowing the organizational gap that drives the digital divide, ensuring equitable benefits across diverse production entities through targeted training programs and institutional safeguards. International experiences provide additional context for interpreting these results. Studies on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau indicate that digital technologies have been highly effective in grassland monitoring [79], yet their broader development remains dependent on policy frameworks and public investment due to uneven infrastructure provision [80]. In New Zealand, such technologies have created new opportunities to enhance both the sustainability and productivity of grasslands and pastures [81]. In African pastoral areas, the introduction of mobile communication and other digital tools has markedly improved herders’ access to information on forage availability, water resources, and weather conditions [82]—an advantage particularly significant in weakly connected social networks, where it can expand the range of potential transactions. Similarly, research on the European ruminant industry has shown that the adoption of digital technologies is strongly correlated with herd size; compared with small-scale herders, those managing larger herds are more inclined to integrate advanced technologies into their operations [83]. Collectively, these cases reinforce the central conclusion of this study: while digital technologies hold substantial promise for improving grassland resource management, their effectiveness is shaped by social networks, policy support, and the type of production entity. Limitations remain. The cross-sectional dataset cannot capture dynamic impacts, and leasing-out behavior—often closely linked to leasing-in—is not examined. Future research should use panel data and an integrated framework covering both leasing-in and leasing-out to generate more comprehensive policy insights. Using micro-level survey data, this study empirically investigates the impact of digital technologies on herders’ grassland leasing-in behavior. The analysis produces four key insights. First, adopting digital technologies optimizes the allocation of grassland resources and significantly increases both the probability of herders participating in transfer-in and the scale of transferred areas. Second, digital technologies indirectly enhance the probability of transfer-in by improving scale efficiency, highlighting their role in factor allocation. Third, strong social networks tend to weaken, whereas weak social networks moderately amplify, the positive influence of digital technologies on transfer-in. This pattern identifies social capital structure as a critical determinant of digital dividends. Fourth, the impact of digital technology on grassland leasing-in varies with the intensity of environmental regulation and the type of production entity. Specifically, digital adoption has a significant effect on leasing-in under weak-incentive and strong-restriction environments. Moreover, compared with ordinary herders, its positive effect is stronger for those with higher educational attainment and for new-type operators. Taken together, these findings suggest that digital technologies function not as universal enablers but as context-dependent catalysts, with their benefits concentrated where institutional conditions and organizational capacity are most aligned. Based on the above analysis, this study proposes the following policy recommendations: First, promoting inclusive digital technology initiatives is essential. Beyond general advocacy, local governments and industry associations should provide last-mile connectivity subsidies to households in remote pastoral areas, ensuring stable internet access across villages and seasonal camps. This effort can be complemented by distributing “starter digital kits”—such as GPS ear tags, collars, and grass-yield sensors—to low-income herders. At the community level, shared digital service centers with computers, internet access, and trained facilitators should function as hubs for troubleshooting and equipment maintenance. For herders with lower levels of education, governments and local livestock departments should provide regular “one-to-one” or “peer-to-peer” digital literacy training. These programs should emphasize practical skills—such as mobile application use, operation of grassland leasing platforms, online price comparison, and digital contract signing—to help herders overcome barriers to digital adoption. Second, weak social networks can be leveraged as informational bridges by developing officially endorsed digital platforms for grassland transfer. These platforms should include standardized listing templates, searchable land-availability maps, and secure e-contract modules. To boost weak social networks, these platforms should incorporate open bidding functions and transparent transaction records accessible to all registered users. Trust among unfamiliar users can be strengthened through third-party credit scoring based on transaction history and performance insurance mechanisms that automatically compensate counterparties in case of breach. Third, the targeted cultivation of digitally enabled new-type operators—such as cooperatives and family ranches—should be prioritized. This requires tailored digital solutions (e.g., automated feed dispensers) together with capacity-building grants linked to measurable adoption outcomes. Subsidized technical advisory visits can support new-type operators in optimizing their operations, while peer-learning networks should diffuse best practices to smaller, traditional herders, thereby lowering technological barriers through spillover effects. Finally, strengthening the synergy between environmental regulations and digital technologies is essential. In practice, satellite-based grassland monitoring should be combined with real-time alerts to notify herders of grazing limits or degradation risks, enabling compliance before penalties occur. Local authorities should implement compliance-linked incentives, such as reduced land rental fees or direct payments for maintaining stocking rates within carrying capacity thresholds. To ensure fairness, these incentives should be delivered through the same digital platforms used for land transactions, with clear eligibility criteria and transparent, auditable disbursement processes. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.s001 (XLSX)

Polyamines (PAs), including spermidine, spermine and their precursor, putrescine, are ubiquitous molecules that are vital for a variety of physiological processes. Recently, PAs gained research attention because of their roles in promoting longevity and preventing age-related diseases. Circulating and tissue levels of PAs appear to decline with age, while higher intake of PAs in humans is correlated with better health during aging. Many foods, including plants and offal (organ meats), are good sources of dietary PAs, but are consumed much less in regions with prevailing Western diets. Elevating the circulating levels of PAs through dietary supplementation with PA-rich plant extracts or foods, on the other hand, has proven to be challenging, most likely due to their low bioavailability. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of nutritional supplements derived from bovine glandular tissues and/or plant material in elevating blood and tissue levels of spermidine, spermine and putrescine in adult rats. We detected appreciable amounts of PAs in the following materials: 1) spermidine-rich supplement (SRS), containing wheat germ, 2) a cytosolic fraction extract of bovine thymus gland (Thymus Cytosolic Fraction – TCF) and 3) a nuclear fraction extract of bovine thymus gland (Thymus Nuclear Fraction – TNF). We showed that all three PA-containing supplements also contain liposomes, with TNF displaying the largest amounts of liposomal PAs, as well as RNAs, among the tested supplements. We demonstrated that oral administration of SRS, TCF and TNF induce rapid changes in blood PA concentrations. Finally, we showed that TNF supplement is superior to SRS and TCF in elevating the levels of spermidine in the blood, liver and heart following a 28-day supplementation period. Considering the importance of PAs in prevention of age-related disease, supplementation with TNF could be a plausible approach towards the maintenance of proper cellular PA homeostasis during aging.

Polyamines (PAs), namely spermidine and spermine, including their precursor putrescine, are naturally occurring, positively charged alkylamines that are present in every living cell and are essential for a wide range of cellular physiological processes and functions [1]. PAs are abundant across all kingdoms of life and have attracted the attention of researchers because of their many diverse functional roles in cardio- and neuroprotection, neuromodulation, lifespan extension, and prevention of age-related diseases [1–12]. Multiple lines of research evidence suggest that higher dietary intakes of PAs are associated with lower mortality rates and reduced incidence of diseases in humans [11–17]. In addition, recent studies demonstrated an important relationship between blood PA concentrations, the ratios of individual PAs, and healthy life span [17–19]. PAs have essential and diverse cellular functions, which include structural stabilization of RNA and DNA [20–22], DNA condensation [23], RNA processing [24,25], regulation of gene expression [25,26], protein synthesis and posttranslational modification [27], reducing oxidative stress [28], promoting cell growth and cell cycle progression [29], and possible regulation of autophagy, mitophagy, apoptosis and inflammation [30–34], among others [7,35–39]. Essentially, PAs are vital for cell survival, and their depletion would severely compromise cellular growth and function [40]. As organisms age, however, PA levels in tissues decline, contributing to the disruption of many molecular pathways associated with age-related diseases [41–44]. The pools of PAs in the body are maintained through three distinct routes: 1) endogenous synthesis, 2) production of PAs by the microorganisms residing in the intestinal tract, and 3) dietary intake – the most important and also modifiable source of PAs [10]. Among the dietary sources of PAs are diverse foods of plant and animal origins, many of which are found abundantly in Mediterranean diets that are thought to promote longevity and prevent age-related diseases [14,39,41,45,46]. Among the plant sources, wheat germ is one of the richest in PAs, especially spermidine [47]. High concentrations of PAs are also found in foods of animal origin, such as edible offal (organ meats), including intestine, thymus and liver [14,45,48,49]. Of note, consumption of offal and other foods that are common in Mediterranean diets (i.e., fermented foods, vegetables, fruit), is much lower in the countries with predominant Western diets, which may have an impact on overall population longevity and health during aging [50,51]. PAs that come from either the diet or gut microflora are absorbed intact in the gut lumen, but their concentrations drop from millimolar to low micromolar ranges rapidly after ingestion through poorly understood mechanisms, making PAs “high supply and low utilization” compounds [52,53]. Even though specialized carriers have been proposed to mediate PA transport across intestinal enterocytes, their affinity for PAs may differ based on their location at the apical versus basal membranes of enterocytes, while PAs that are absorbed are quickly distributed across tissues with high proliferative demands, including the cells of the gastrointestinal tract itself.[54–56] In addition, PAs that reach rat tissues 6 hours following exogenous PA administration mediate a 30−300 fold increase in the activity of spermidine/spermine N-1-acetyltransferase (SSAT), an enzyme involved in the conversion of higher PAs back to putrescine, thereby limiting their availability.[57] Consistent with this, supplementation with high doses of spermidine, whether in the form of a supplement or in the context of spermidine-rich foods, does not increase its levels in plasma or in saliva [58–60]. Multiple studies in humans and in rodents demonstrated that supplementation with foods rich in PAs, even for as long as 1 year in humans, does not increase blood spermidine levels, while spermine levels can gradually increase [11,53,61]. These studies confirm that the bioavailability of food-derived spermidine is very low. Indeed, concentrations of PAs in the blood depend on the maintenance of PA homeostasis, which is a tightly controlled and highly dynamic process [17,56,62]. Putrescine is a substrate for the synthesis of spermidine, which can be further converted to spermine, while a series of acetylation and oxidation reactions mediate the conversion of the higher PAs back to their precursors (Fig 1) [63]. A set of enzymes and antizymes, whose activity and/or expression are regulated by the abundance of their substrates, putrescine or higher PAs, as well as by many environmental factors, including injuries or pathologic conditions, mediates rapid bi-directional interconversion of each of the PAs into a different type and their import, export, metabolism and catabolism, and controls the changes in PA ratios. Yet, blood PA levels, and PA ratios specifically, can serve as biomarkers of human health status [64–66]. Spermidine is synthesized from putrescine by spermidine synthase (SRM), and spermine is produced from spermidine by spermine synthase (SMS). Direct conversion of spermine to spermidine is mediated by spermine oxidase (SMO). Additional pathways converting spermine to spermidine, and spermidine to putrescine, require sequential actions of spermine/spermidine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) and N1-acetylpolyamine oxidase (APAO) enzymes.

Spermidine supplementation, on the other hand, was shown to exert a neuroprotective effect in the context of TBI, such that the recovery from TBI is enhanced in rodents receiving spermidine prior to and post-injury [69]. Coincidentally, we recently demonstrated a neuroprotective effect of a nutritional supplement containing a nuclear fraction of bovine thymus gland (Thymus – Nuclear Fraction, TNF) by showing that supplementation of rats with TNF prior to and post TBI accelerated their functional recovery [70]. Given that thymus is a glandular organ that could potentially be a good dietary source of PAs [45,48,49], we hypothesized that TNF supplement may deliver bioavailable PAs, which would partially explain the observed neuroprotective role of TNF supplementation. In the current study we investigated whether TNF supplement contains PAs and could change their circulating levels when administered orally. We compared a whole food supplement containing defatted wheat germ, termed spermidine-rich supplement (SRS), with bovine thymus extracts – TNF, thymus cytosolic fraction (TCF) and thymus desiccated (freeze dried) material (TD), as well as nuclear fractions of bovine liver and heart (LNF and HNF), with respect to their PA content and effectiveness in increasing blood and tissue PA levels. We show that SRS contains the highest amount of spermidine among the tested supplements, yet TNF is a supplement that predominantly delivers the liposomal, bioavailable form of spermidine and is capable of elevating its levels in the blood, liver and heart following 28 days of oral supplementation in rats. Together, these results represent the first demonstration that a nutritional supplement containing a nuclear fraction of bovine thymus is a source of bioavailable forms of PAs and can increase the levels of spermidine in the blood and in tissues. All nutritional supplements evaluated in this study were obtained from Standard Process Inc. (Palmyra, WI, USA) and are commercially available as nutritional supplements. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared from frozen raw bovine glands and dried on-site using Standard Process Inc. proprietary processes. Briefly, the cytoplasmic cellular material was extracted following incubation of the raw homogenized thymus tissue in water, while the nuclear material was isolated using salts following the removal of the cytoplasmic material. No extraction procedures were applied towards the desiccated, freeze-dried thymus material. All test products are in powder form and are suitable for consumption by animals and humans. The following supplements were used: 1) Spermidine-Rich supplement (SRS) containing plant- and bovine tissue-derived materials (a proprietary blend containing bovine liver, organic beet [root], nutritional yeast, defatted wheat germ, rice bran, organic sweet potato, organic carrot, and bovine adrenal gland), 2) bovine thymus cytosolic fraction extract (TCF), 3) bovine thymus nuclear fraction extract (TNF), 4) desiccated bovine thymus (TD), 5) bovine liver nuclear fraction extract (LNF) and 6) bovine heart nuclear fraction extract (HNF). Measurements of individual PA concentrations in nutritional supplements were conducted by Eurofins Scientific (Luxembourg) using high-performance liquid chromatography method EN ISO 19343, essentially as described in Duflos et al. (2019) [71]. Two lots of materials were tested for each supplement. Cryo-TEM was performed at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA). Solutions were prepared from supplement powders at a concentration of 100 mg/mL, centrifuged, and the supernatant was used in grid preparation. A 5 µl solution aliquot was placed on a thin copper grid that had been glow discharged. For preparation of the grid, the samples were loaded into the freezing chamber at low temperature (0–5°C) under humidity control (100%). After blotting for 3 seconds (s) with filter paper, the specimen was rapidly frozen with cryogen – liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen. The prepared grid was mounted for imaging using a 200 kV FEI Tecnai F20 electron microscope. DLS analysis was conducted at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA). Ten mg of each supplement powder were resuspended in 0.1 mL of water. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used in particle size analysis following the Zetasizer Nano Series manufacturer’s standard protocol (Malvern Panalytical, London, United Kingdom). NTA analysis was performed at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA). The NanoSight NS300 instrument (Malvern Panalytical, London, United Kingdom) was calibrated using 100 nm beads and primed with filtered 1X PBS since the nanoparticles are isolated in PBS. The stock dilutions of nanoparticles were prepared in 1X PBS and samples were injected into the instrument using a 1 cc syringe. Individual particles were visualized in real-time and NTA was performed at 25 °C using a 488 nm laser. Data were collected from 11 positions. HPLC analysis was performed at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA) essentially as described in Tamim et al (2002) [72]. Briefly, HPLC method consisted of a perchloric acid extraction step, derivatization step using dansyl chloride, separation step using elution gradient of methanol and water, and fluorescence-based detection. HPLC results were calculated using a calibration curve created using the same methodology as used for sample analysis. One gram of each supplement powder was resuspended in 10 mL of water and centrifuged to remove the insoluble precipitate. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 150,000 g for 2 hrs to collect the liposomal nanoparticles. After centrifugation, the liposomal nanoparticles were resuspended in 10 mL water and thoroughly mixed with 0.5% triton X-100, and the liposomes were destroyed by slight shock. The suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 g at 4°C for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. Amounts of loaded spermidine, spermine and putrescine were determined by HPLC. Encapsulation efficiency was determined using the following formula: S1 Table shows the detailed procedures used for characterization of PA encapsulation. The detection limit of the HPLC assay used was 5 ppm; 1 ppm = 1 µg/mL. RNA analysis was performed at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA) following the Quant-iT™ RNA Assay Kit’s standard manual (Thermo Fisher Scientific, High Point, NC, USA). RNA standards were prepared by adding 10 µL of each of the E. coli rRNA standard in diluted RNA buffer to separate wells in triplicate and mixing. Ten µL of each unknown RNA sample were added to separate wells and mixed well. Two hundred µL of the working solution (diluted Quant-iT™ RNA reagent) were loaded onto each microplate well and fluorescence was measured using a microplate reader (excitation/emission maxima were 644/673 nm) and RNA amounts were determined using the E. coli rRNA-based standard curve. The encapsulation efficiency for RNA followed the same method described in the section above. DNA quantification was performed at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA) using AlphaLISA Host Cell Residual DNA Detection Kit (Revvity, Waltham, MA, USA). DNA Detection Buffer (1X) was made by adding 10 mL of 10X buffer stock solution and 2 mL of UltraPure BSA to 88 mL of pure water. MIX solutions (2.5X) were prepared by adding 50 µL of 5 mg/mL Anti DNA Acceptor beads and 50 µL of 500 nM Biotinylated Anti DNA to 9.9 mL of 1X DNA Detection Buffer. Streptavidin (SA) Donor beads solution (2X; 20 µg/mL) was prepared by adding 50 µL of 5 mg/mL SA-Donor beads to 12.45 mL of 1X DNA Detection Buffer. For DNA amount quantification, 5 µL of each sample was incubated with 20 µL of 2.5X MIX solution for 1 hour at 23°C, followed by adding 25 µL of 2X SA- Donor beads solution and incubation for 30 min at 23°C. Plates were read using SpectraMax® M5e Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Wokingham, United Kingdom) at 615nm. The encapsulation efficiency for DNA followed the same method described above. All animal studies were conducted at PsychoGenics, Inc. (Paramus, New Jersey, USA); all housing and testing of the rats were conducted in accordance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care and the approval of PsychoGenics Inc., Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in AAALAC-accredited facilities. A total of eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats, 9 weeks old, fitted with jugular vein catheters (JVCs), weighing 200–250 g at arrival (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN, USA), and 18 male SpragueDawley rats, 9 weeks old, without JVCs, weighing 200–250 g at arrival (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN, USA), were used for the acute and chronic supplementation studies, respectively. Animal catheterization was performed at Envigo (Indianapolis, IN, USA) prior to their arrival. Animals were assigned unique identification numbers (tail marks), were housed in pairs in ventilated cages and were examined, handled, weighed and acclimated for 7 days prior to the initiation of the study to assure adequate health and suitability. 12/12 light/dark cycles, 20–23°C room temperature and a relative humidity of approximately 50% were maintained during the study. Body weights (BWs) were measured 2 times per week throughout the study. Chow (Lab diet 5001, LabDiets, St. Louis, MO, USA) and water were provided ad libitum. Testing was conducted during the light cycle, and rats in the same cage received the same treatment. Rats with JVCs were balanced by BW and assigned to one of the 3 treatment groups, with each group consisting of 6 rats. Animals housed in the same cage all received the same treatment. Tested nutritional supplements (raw material powders containing active ingredients) were administered orally (oral gavage, PO) at a dose volume of 10 ml/kg as follows: SRS – 645 mg/kg body weight (BW), TCF – 1276 mg/BW and TNF – 1411 mg/BW. These doses delivered approximately 0.12–0.2 mg/kg BW of spermidine and 0.05–0.13 mg/kg BW of spermine and were calculated based on the varying amounts of PAs and excipients present in each supplement. Blood (300 µl) was collected from JVC at the following timepoints: 0 min (blood drawing prior to dosing, baseline), 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours after dose administration.[73,74] Blood was collected into lithium heparin coated tubes and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at – 80°C. Rats were decapitated using guillotine at the end of the study. Rats were balanced by BW and assigned to one of the 3 treatment groups, with each group consisting of 6 rats. Animals in the same cage all received the same treatment. Nutritional supplements were administered orally, 2 times per day, at a dose volume of 5 ml/kg and a dose of 175 mg/kg BW (350 mg/kg BW per day) for 28 days. Considering an average human weight of 65 kg and a conversion factor of 6.2 between rat and human, the human equivalent dose would be approximately 3.4 grams per day [75]. The approximate daily amounts of spermidine delivered by this dose for each supplement were as follows: SRS – 0.072 mg/kg BW, TCF – 0.034 mg/kg BW, and TNF – 0.050 mg/kg BW. This daily dose given to rats is equivalent to human doses of 0.76, 0.36 and 0.53 mg of spermidine for SRS, TCF and TNF, respectively. For baseline blood collection, blood (300 µl) was collected from tail vein into lithium heparin coated tubes and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80°C. Animals were not administered tested supplements on the day of terminal tissue collection (Day 29). On Day 29, Rats were decapitated using guilootine, and trunk blood was collected into lithium heparin coated tubes and flash frozen on dry ice. Brains, hearts and livers were weighed, and flash frozen on dry ice. All tissue samples were stored at −80°C. Quantitative analysis of a total of 198 blood/tissue samples for the amounts of putrescine, spermidine and spermine was performed by Creative Proteomics (Shirley, NY, USA) using an AB SCIEX API 4000 mass spectrometry instrument (Danaher Corporation, Washington, D.C., USA) connected to Waters Acquity ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) instrument (Waters Corp, Milford, MA, USA). Fifty µL of each blood sample were mixed with 200 µL of ice-cold methanol (with 0.5% formic acid) in a 2 mL tube and vortexed for 3 min. After 10 min of ultrasound-assisted extraction at 4°C, the mixture was centrifuged at 17,000 g at 4°C for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter. The sample was further diluted in pure water (with 0.5% formic acid) and 10 µL of the sample were injected into the UPLC-MS/MS for analysis. All tissue samples (brain, liver and heart) were lyophilized before weighing. Briefly, 50 mg of each sample and 3 steel beads were placed into a 2.0 mL tube and 1 mL water (with 0.5% formic acid) was added to each tube. The samples were homogenized by a bead beater for 10 min. After 10 min ultrasound-assisted extraction at 4°C, the mixture was centrifuged at 17,000 g and 4°C for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter. Each sample was further diluted in pure water (with 0.5% formic acid) and 10 µL of the sample was injected into the UPLC-MS/MS for analysis. Putrescine, spermidine and spermine standards were dissolved in pure water (with 0.5% formic acid) to achieve 1 mg/mL stocking solutions. The standards were diluted in pure water (with 0.5% formic acid) to get gradient concentrations from 1 ng/mL to 200 ng/mL. Ten μL of each sample were used for the UPLC-MS/MS. Chromatographic condition: Waters Acquity UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1 × 150 mm 1.8 µm) coupled with a VanGuard precolumn (2.1 × 5 mm 1.8 µm). LC parameters: Mobile Phase A – pure water (with 0.5% formic acid); Mobile Phase B – acetonitrile (with 0.1% formic acid). The column temperature was held at 40°C. The sample chamber temperature was held at 10°C. Flow rate was 0.25 mL/min. The elution gradients are shown in S2 Table. Mass Spectrometry parameters: MS condition – ESI positive mode; Ion source temperature – 450°C; IS – 4500 V; CAD – 10 psi; CUR – 40 psi; GS1–45 psi; GS2–45 psi; Q1 and Q3 parameters for measured PAs are shown in S3 Table. Acute changes in blood PA levels in Study 1 were analyzed using Repeated Measures ANOVA and Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc test. Paired Student’s t-test was used to compare changes in blood PA levels from Day 0 to day 29, following 28 days of supplementation in Study 2. Changes in tissue PA levels were compared using Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc analysis. Significant changes with p values < 0.05 are marked by an asterisk (*). Graphical data analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 software (La Jolla, CA, USA, RRID: SCR_002798). To begin investigating whether nutritional supplements that are composed of materials derived from plants/animal tissues contain PAs we evaluated SRS, TCF, TNF, LNF, HNF materials, and the freeze-dried, desiccated thymus material (TD), for concentrations of putrescine, spermidine, spermine, histamine and cadaverine. We found that the SRS, which consists of both plant- and bovine tissue-derived materials, contained the highest levels of spermidine among the tested supplements (206.73 mg/kg) (Fig 2). The cytosolic and the nuclear fractions of bovine thymus, TCF and TNF, contained lower amounts of spermidine compared to SRS (97.14 mg/kg and 143.86 mg/kg, respectively), while TNF had the highest levels of putrescine among all the tested supplements (Fig 2). Desiccated thymus material, on the other hand, was not rich in either putrescine, spermidine or spermine. Neither LNF nor HNF contained appreciable amounts of the most abundant PAs – spermidine and spermine. These data show that a supplement containing wheat germ, which is rich in spermidine, as well as cytosolic and nuclear fractions of bovine thymus, can potentially be good sources of spermidine, spermine and putrescine. Putrescine, spermine, spermidine, histamine and cadaverine were measured in SRS, TCF, TNF, TD, LNF and HNF supplements using HPLC [71]. Data are shown as Mean ± S.E.M.; two distinct lots of materials were analyzed. Putrescine, spermine, spermidine, histamine and cadaverine were measured in SRS, TCF, TNF, TD, LNF and HNF supplements using HPLC [71]. Data are shown as Mean ± S.E.M.; two distinct lots of materials were analyzed. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.g002 A study by Acosta-Andrade et al. (2017) has shown that PAs can induce aggregation of lipid vesicles, such as liposomes [76]. Liposomal delivery of nutrient compounds, as well as drugs, is considered more efficient compared to the delivery of unencapsulated materials because liposomes are stable, lipids-based nanoparticles that are resistant to breakdown through digestion or oxidation, and hence can improve the bioavailability of their cargo [77]. To test whether nutritional supplements containing PAs also contain liposomes we performed Cryo-TEM analysis of the SRS, TCF, TNF and the desiccated thymus material, TD. Supplements that did not contain appreciable levels of PAs were excluded from further study. We detected liposomes in solutions of SRS, TCF and TNF supplements (Fig 3A–C), while TD was devoid of liposomal structures (Fig 3D). (A-D) Representative images of SRS, TCF, TNF and TD supplements, show the presence of liposomal particles in the SRS, TCF and TNF (A-C; red arrows), but not in TD (D).

Scale bars in (A-D): 500 nm. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.g003 DLS analysis showed that the average size of liposomes present in TNF was larger compared to SRS and TCF supplements (Table 1; S1 Fig A–C). NTA analysis further revealed that SRS contains the highest numbers of liposomal particles compared to TCF and TNF supplements (Table 2). Together, these data demonstrate that the tested supplements composed of plant- and bovine tissue-derived materials contain liposomal particles, which are known to protect the encapsulated molecules from premature breakdown, thus increasing their bioavailability. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t002 The presence of liposomal particles in the SRS, TCF and TNF nutritional supplements led us to investigate whether PAs in these supplements were encapsulated within the liposomes. Each of the supplements was examined in 3 distinct ways (see Materials and Methods): 1) putrescine, spermidine and spermine were measured in perchloric acid solutions of supplement powders using HPLC (assessing total free PA content), 2) total putrescine, spermidine and spermine were measured in solutions following the destruction of the liposomes (assessing total PA content), and 3) putrescine, spermidine and spermine were measured in destructed liposomes specifically (assessing encapsulated PA content). We found that among the tested supplements, TNF contained the highest total amounts of PAs, measured following the destruction of the liposomes (Total PA content; Table 3). The encapsulation efficiency of PAs was difficult to assess, most likely due to the known vulnerability of liposomes to destruction during the ultracentrifugation process, resulting in losses of certain types of entrapped molecular cargo [79,80]. Relatively low abundance of liposomes in the solutions of each supplement (Table 2; Fig 3) and the limitations of the HPLC assay used (detection limit of 5 µg/mL) could have also contributed to low recovery of the encapsulated PAs. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t003 Partly owing to their positive charge, most PAs within the cells are bound to RNA and exist in PA-RNA complexes [24,38]. We therefore examined whether liposomal particles found in the SRS, TCF and TNF supplements contain RNA. We found that RNA was present in all the tested supplements and that RNA in the TNF supplement was predominantly contained within the liposomal particles, evidenced by the highest encapsulation efficiency detected for TNF (91%) (Table 4). Negligible amount of DNA was detected in TCF, and none in the SRS and TNF supplements (S4 Table). These results show that RNA molecules can be potentially delivered by the SRS, TCF and TNF supplements, with most of the RNA contained in the TNF supplement being encapsulated within the liposomal particles. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t004 Rapid cyclic interconversion and catabolism of PAs are intricately regulated processes that partly rely on the tissue abundance of each of the PAs and ultimately determine their levels in the blood [63]. To begin investigating whether PAs present in the SRS, TCF and TNF supplements are bioavailable and can impact circulating PA levels, we measured blood PA concentrations at baseline and 5 timepoints within a 6-hour period following supplement administration to rats by oral gavage. Each supplement was administered at a dose that delivered approximately 0.12–0.2 mg/kg BW of spermidine and 0.05–0.13 mg/kg BW of spermine. As expected, we observed rapid changes in the concentrations of PAs in response to the oral delivery of each of the three tested supplements, with these changes being highly similar between the groups (Fig4). First, blood levels of putrescine were moderately decreased 1 hour after the gavage procedure, followed by a gradual increase in blood putrescine levels with each of the three supplements (Fig 4A, B; p < 0.0001); a significant effect of time variable was observed at 6 hours after supplement administration compared to baseline (Baseline vs 6 hours: p < 0.0001). On the contrary, blood levels of spermidine gradually and significantly decreased during the 6 hours after the oral gavage procedure (Fig 4C, D; p < 0.0001), with significant effect of time variable observed at 1–6 hours following supplement administration (Baseline vs 1 hour: p = 0.0006; Baseline vs 2 hours: p < 0.0001; Baseline vs 4 hours: p < 0.0001; Baseline vs 6 hours: p < 0.0001). Blood levels of spermine, on the other hand, steadily increased following supplement administration (Fig 4E, F; p < 0.0001), with significant effect of time variable observed at 2–6 hours after supplement administration (Baseline vs 2 hours: p < 0.0001; Baseline vs 4 hours: p = 0.021; Baseline vs 6 hours: p < 0.0001). These results show that oral administration of either SRS, TCF or TNF leads to rapid increases in blood concentrations of putrescine and spermine, and a decrease in spermidine. Rats received one oral dose of either SRS, TCF or TNF (see Materials and Methods) and blood concentrations of PAs were measured using UPLC-MS/MS at following time intervals: Baseline, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs and 6 hrs (see Materials and Methods). N = 6 animals per group. PA concentrations are shown in (A, C, E) and concentration changes compared to baseline in (B, D, F). Data are shown as Mean ± S.E.M.; * - significant effect of Time variable by Repeated Measures ANOVA and Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc test, p < 0.05. Rats received one oral dose of either SRS, TCF or TNF (see Materials and Methods) and blood concentrations of PAs were measured using UPLC-MS/MS at following time intervals: Baseline, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs and 6 hrs (see Materials and Methods).

Sustained delivery of liposomal PAs could potentially affect the enzymes and antizymes involved in PA metabolism and catabolism at the transcriptional and translational levels. We therefore assessed blood and tissue PA concentrations in rats supplemented with the SRS, TCF and TNF for 28 days. Each supplement was administered orally at the same dose of 175 mg/kg BW twice per day. We found that the blood levels of putrescine were reduced by over 15% following sustained supplementation with SRS and TCF, and by over 30% with TNF administration compared to baseline levels (Fig 5A, B; Tables 5–6). On the contrary, blood levels of spermidine increased following sustained SRS and TNF supplementation, with TNF administration resulting in the largest blood spermidine increase of over 22% (Fig 5C, D; Tables 5–6). Finally, blood levels of spermine were modestly reduced only with SRS supplementation (Fig 5E, F; Tables 5–6), tended to increase with TNF treatment, and remained largely unchanged in TCF-supplemented animals compared to baseline. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t006 (A, C, E) Blood concentrations of putrescine were significantly reduced in SRS-, TCF- and TNF-supplemented animals (A), spermidine levels significantly increased following supplementation with SRS and TNF (C) and spermine levels did not change significantly between the groups (E) on Day 29 compared to baseline (Day 0). Data are shown as minimum/maximum box plots, N = 6 animals per group. (B, D, F) Changes in blood putrescine (B), spermidine (D) and spermine (F) from baseline are shown as individual values and the mean; * - p < 0.05 by Paired Student’s t-test (please, see Table 5). (A, C, E) Blood concentrations of putrescine were significantly reduced in SRS-, TCF- and TNF-supplemented animals (A), spermidine levels significantly increased following supplementation with SRS and TNF (C) and spermine levels did not change significantly between the groups (E) on Day 29 compared to baseline (Day 0).

We found that the levels of all three PAs in brain tissues were not significantly different between the SRS-, TCF- and TNF-supplemented animals (Fig 6A–C; Table 7). However, the levels of spermidine and spermine in the heart and liver tissues differed between the supplementation groups. Specifically, TNF-supplemented animals displayed increased levels of spermidine in the heart compared to TCF-supplemented group (Fig 6E; effect of Treatment variable: p = 0.0461 by Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc test; Table 7). In the liver, spermidine levels were significantly higher in TNF-supplemented animals compared to SRS-supplemented animals (Fig 6H; effect of Treatment variable: p = 0.0043 by Bonferroni-Dunn post-hoc analysis; Table 7), accompanied by the increased levels of spermine (Fig 6I; effect of Treatment variable: p = 0.0232 by Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc test; Table 7). Liver putrescine levels remained unchanged between the groups (Fig 6G; Table 7). Importantly, no significant changes in spermine/spermidine ratios, which are known to decrease in diseased states, were observed in the blood or tissues of TNF-supplemented animals, while blood spermine/spermidine ratio decreased with SRS supplementation (S2 Fig) [18,81]. Thus, among the three tested supplements, TNF is most potent at raising the blood and tissue levels of spermidine and spermine without affecting the spermine/spermidine ratios. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t007 Concentrations of putrescine, spermidine and spermine were measured in tissues of supplemented animals at the end of the 28-day supplementation period. (A-C) In brain tissues, no differences in PA levels were observed between the supplementation groups. (D-F) In heart tissues, TNF supplementation resulted in increased spermidine levels compared to TCF-supplemented animals.

Data are shown as individual values and the mean; N = 4-6 animals per group. * - P < 0.05 by Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc analysis (see Table 6).

Considering that endogenous PA synthesis may gradually diminish with age, along with the increasing PA catabolism, reduction in PA production by the gut bacteria and compromised intestinal absorption during aging, nutritional supplementation with PA-containing products and increased dietary intake of PA-rich foods are plausible approaches towards ensuring adequate availability of PAs in older adults [1,9,14,16,82,83]. However, elevating the circulating levels of PAs in the blood, which are thought to reflect their tissue levels as well, through dietary supplementation appears to be challenging [5,53,58,60,82]. In this study, we describe a novel finding that the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of bovine thymus gland, TCF and TNF, as well as a nutritional supplement containing wheat germ, SRS, can all serve as the sources of dietary PAs, with TNF being most potent at elevating blood and tissue levels of spermidine. Among the materials tested in this study, TNF elicited the largest increase in blood spermidine levels (22%) after 28 days of supplementation. This effect of TNF is not likely to be mediated strictly by the total amounts of PAs it contains, but to their liposomal encapsulation in this particular type of thymus gland extract. Indeed, we found that the concentration of total spermidine is the highest in the SRS material, which contains wheat germ (approximately 207 mg/kg) – nearly double the amounts detected in TCF and TNF (approximately 86 mg/kg and 75 mg/kg, respectively). This finding is consistent with the reports that wheat germ is a good dietary source of PAs [47]. Between the bovine thymus gland-derived supplements, however, TNF contains the lowest amount of spermine, but the highest amount of PA precursor – putrescine (approximately 152 mg/kg). Surprisingly, the nuclear fraction extracts of two other bovine organs we tested, liver and heart, do not contain appreciable amounts of putrescine, spermidine or spermine, suggesting that PA content in these extracts may be low due to distinct cellular compositions of liver and heart tissues compared to thymus, or due to losses during the nuclear material extraction procedure. Nevertheless, this study is the first to report on the presence of PAs in nutritional supplements composed of natural ingredients, including bovine glandular tissue extract and wheat germ, and the effects of these supplements on PA homeostasis in vivo. Nutritional supplementation with PAs is typically approached using plant extracts, including bacterial fermentation products (i.e., wheat germ extract; natto), or synthetic PA forms [1,53,58,59]. Liposomal forms of spermidine are also available as supplements and can potentially increase its bioavailability, but to our knowledge, their effectiveness in supporting blood or tissue PA levels has yet to be reported. In this study, we show that SRS, TCF and TNF contain lipid nanoparticles that fit the characteristics of liposomes – bilayer vesicles composed of lipids and phospholipids, which can spontaneously form in aqueous solutions and primarily encapsulate hydrophilic molecules present in such solutions (i.e., positively charged polyamines) [84]. Interestingly, the concentration of lipid nanoparticles in the SRS (5.15x108 particles/mL) is nearly double their concentration in the TNF supplement (2.53x108 particles/mL), while nanoparticle average size is the largest in TNF among the tested supplements – 285 nm compared to 151 nm in TCF and 207 nm in the SRS. The size distribution of the observed nanoparticles (151–258 nm in diameter), combined with their presence in the extracts of the intracellular cytoplasmic and nuclear materials, excludes the possibility of them being either exosomes, which only reach approximately 100 nm is diameter, or other types of extracellular, secreted microvesicles [85,86]. The PDI values, which serve as measures of liposome quality during their production, were below 0.7 for all three tested supplements, indicating that liposomal particles contained in these materials are relatively uniform with respect to their sizes [87]. Unlike the artificial liposomes designed for the improvement of drug or vitamin/nutrient formulations and delivery, which are typically produced using defined ratios of phospholipids isolated from soy, eggs, milk, bacteria or synthetic phospholipids [84,88–91], self-assembly of liposomes found in the SRS, TCF and TNF is likely to be induced during the extraction process from the lipids that naturally exist within the plant and animal tissue intracellular materials. Hence, we observed that the desiccated (freeze dried) thymus material, which was not subjected to the extraction process, does not contain liposomal particles. While the sizes of liposomes observed in the SRS, TCF and TNF supplements (> 151 nm) suggest that they are likely to enter cells via endocytosis [87], and micropinocytosis specifically, further studies are needed to determine the precise lipid compositions of these particles, their content and physiological properties. Because PAs can promote aggregation and fusion of liposomes, and often exist within the molecular complexes containing RNA, it is not surprising that these lipid particles are found in PA-rich extracts of plant and thymus gland materials used in this study, and also contain RNA in addition to PAs [24,76,92]. Yet, the amounts of PAs and RNA encapsulated in the liposomes vary greatly between the supplements we examined. We show that the concentrations of liposomal PAs, and spermidine in particular, are severalfold higher in the TNF supplement compared to the SRS and TCF materials, and that over 90% of the RNA detected in TNF material is encapsulated within the liposomes. Therefore, it is likely that the delivery of larger amounts of liposomal, as opposed to free PAs, underlies the capacity of TNF supplement to elevate blood and tissue levels of spermidine following a 28-day supplementation period compared to the SRS and TCF. The presence of RNAs within the tested supplements, on the other hand, confirms that lipid nanoparticle-RNA formulations are quite stable [93–95], and that a range of bioactive molecules, including PA-RNA complexes, are encapsulated in the liposomes derived from the animal and plant material extracts. Contrary to appreciable levels of RNA, we detected a small amount of DNA in the TCF, and none in the SRS and TNF supplements, possibly due to DNA degradation and losses in aqueous solutions during plant and animal material extraction processes, especially if salts were present (i.e., salt-dependent proprietary extraction method of nuclear material) [96,97]. We confirmed that larger amounts of RNA compared to DNA are found across multiple nuclear fraction extracts of bovine tissues prepared using the same methodology as TNF. Thus, the technology utilized in the extraction of plant and animal tissue materials, and the types of lipids and soluble molecules present in various types of biological matrices, can determine the probability of liposomal particle assembly and the molecular cargo of the liposomes produced, including the final molecular composition of the product [98]. This study highlights the unique properties of nutritional supplements composed of plant and animal tissue-derived materials and their capacity to deliver a range of bioactive molecules within naturally occurring matrices, including liposomal particles. The bioavailability of PAs contained in the SRS, TCF and TNF is first evidenced by our finding that one dose of each supplement exerts pronounced and immediate effects on blood PA levels. Within 6 hours following supplement administration at doses that in humans would be equivalent to 1.29–2.12 mg of spermidine, we observed gradual and significant increases in blood putrescine and spermine levels (approximately 30%), while spermidine levels gradually declined by approximately 40%. Lack of significant differences in the directions and kinetics of blood PA concentration changes among the three supplementation groups could be explained by comparable concentrations of free, non-liposomal spermine and spermidine in tested supplements that could drive the rapid changes in blood PA levels. The observed increase in blood spermine levels in SRS-, TCF- and TNF-supplemented animals is consistent with previous studies that reported its changes in the blood in response to PA-rich extracts or foods [58,82,99,100]. In addition, preferential association of spermine with cellular membranes or nucleic acids in vivo may contribute to the lower affinity of SSAT enzyme, which regulates cellular PA content, for spermine compared to its acetylated form, N1-acetylspermine, possibly leading to the temporary increase in spermine we observed in this part of the study [101]. An increase in blood putrescine levels, on the other hand, has been demonstrated to occur temporarily in response to spermidine administration in rats, peaking at 6 hours, and to be mediated by PA-dependent induction of SSAT and subsequent conversion of N1-acetylspermidine to putrescine by polyamine oxidase (PAO) [102]. This mechanism could partly explain the temporary depletion of spermidine and concomitant increase in putrescine during the 6-hour period following supplement administration. The increases in blood spermidine levels after 28 days of supplementation with TNF and SRS at doses delivering relatively low total amounts of spermidine, equivalent to approximately 0.53 mg and 0.76 mg per day in humans, respectively, further support the bioavailability of PAs present in these materials. This finding adds to the current understanding of dietary PA metabolism, which is based on studies that reported increases in blood or tissue spermidine levels only with substantially higher spermidine doses or longer supplementation periods [5,53,58,59,100,102]. The observed reduction in blood putrescine levels across the supplementation groups could be explained by possible inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) enzyme by exogenous PAs through Antizyme 1-mediated degradation, leading to attenuated putrescine synthesis [103]. S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), an enzyme catalyzing the production of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcAdoMet), which serves a rate limiting role in the synthesis of spermidine and spermine [104,105], and ODC can both be inhibited by spermine and spermidine as part of the mechanism regulating intracellular PA homeostasis, leading to reduced endogenous synthesis of spermine/spermidine and a reduction in putrescine, respectively [106]. SSAT, a key enzyme responsible for the conversion of spermine to spermidine, and spermidine to putrescine, is activated/induced by spermine and spermidine themselves, and may prevent the rise in blood levels of spermine [101,102]. At the same time, the activities of PAO, which can use spermine, N1-acetylspermine and N1-acetylspermidine as substrates, but not spermidine, and spermine oxidase (SMO), can potentially contribute to the elevation in blood levels of spermidine, and not spermine, we observed following 28 days of supplementation with TNF [102,107,108].. The concentrations of PAs in the blood and tissues are linked, such that the variation in health status and diets across individuals contributes to varying blood PA levels observed in human and animal studies, with and without dietary supplementation regimens [5,82]. For example, inflammatory conditions and cancer, among other pathologies, can both lead to dysregulation of PA homeostasis, reflected by either diminished or elevated blood and tissue levels of individual PAs [18,82,109]. Variability in dietary intakes of PA-containing foods can further contribute to inter-personal differences in circulating PA levels [14]. Consistent with this, we detected variability in baseline blood PA levels among the animal groups undergoing 28-day supplementation regimens. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that TNF supplement is superior to the SRS and TCF in increasing blood spermidine concentration compared to baseline values, and in elevating the levels of spermidine in the heart and liver tissues. Consistent with the reports of poor brain penetrance of circulating PAs, we did not detect differences in brain PA levels among the supplementation groups [110,111]. Similarly, we did not detect significant changes in spermine/spermidine ratios, which can reflect diseased states [18,19,81], in the blood and tissues of TNF-supplemented animals – TNF elicited a moderate increase in blood spermine levels concurrently with spermidine, and a significant increase in liver spermine levels compared to the SRS group. On the contrary, an increase in blood spermidine levels with SRS supplementation was not accompanied by an increase in blood spermine levels, leading to a reduction in blood spermine/spermidine ratio in this group. Even though it remains to be determined whether liposomal particles present in each of the tested supplements are transported intact across the intestinal enterocytes or taken up within the Pyer’s patches, as opposed to releasing their content in the intestine [112], TNF, and to a lesser extent SRS, are potent at delivering bioavailable forms of PAs that, even at relatively low doses, increase blood spermidine levels in 28 days. Considering that elevating the circulating levels of PAs through supplementation has been a challenge, oral delivery of these bioactive molecules within the matrices inherent to animal organs that are naturally rich in PAs, such as the extract of the thymus gland described in this study, appears to be an advantage. Adequate dietary supply of PAs is important for ameliorating inflammatory conditions, including systemic chronic inflammation prevalent among aging individuals and leading to decline in health and age-related diseases [28,113–115]. From improving gut barrier integrity and obesity indices, to direct inhibition of inflammatory diseases and proinflammatory status, dietary PA supplementation was shown to be effective in animal models and in humans [60,115,116]. Likewise, we previously demonstrated that in the context of CNS injury, the neuroprotective role of TNF supplement is accompanied by substantial changes in the expression of genes implicated in the regulation of inflammation, autophagy and tissue repair – the processes that are highly relevant to the maintenance of good health during aging [70]. Considering the proposed general decline in PA status among aging individuals, low intake of organ meats in Western diet, and current difficulties in increasing circulating levels of spermidine through dietary means, nutritional supplementation with TNF could be a plausible approach towards delivering bioavailable forms of PAs and supporting health during aging. The effectiveness of TNF in modulating the circulating levels of PAs in humans remains to be evaluated. In this study, we demonstrated that a nutritional supplement containing a nuclear fraction extract of bovine thymus gland (thymus nuclear fraction, TNF) is effective in elevating blood and tissue levels of spermidine within a 28-day treatment period. Since PA-rich diet plays a vital role in preventing age-related diseases and promoting longevity, maintenance of the adequate dietary supply of PAs during aging is of great importance. To date, dietary supplementation with PA-rich products and foods, even if prolonged, has proven to be ineffective in increasing blood and tissue levels of spermine and spermidine. This study demonstrates that spermidine contained in TNF supplement is encapsulated in naturally occurring liposomal particles, which may underly the effectiveness of TNF in increasing spermidine levels in the blood and in tissues. Moreover, we show that acute versus chronic oral administration of polyamines exert distinct effects on the metabolism of putrescine, spermidine and spermine in the blood. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.s004 (DOCX) The dimensions of liposomes and their polydispersity indices (PDI) are shown for the SRS (A), TCF (B) and TNF (C). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.s005 (TIF) (A) Blood spermine/spermidine ratio was significantly reduced in SRS-supplemented animals compared to baseline, while no differences in spermine/spermidine ratios among the supplementation groups were detected in tissues: brain (B), heart (C) and liver (D).

Shares of Nebius Group (NBIS) soared 50% in early trading Tuesday after the artificial intelligence infrastructure company struck a deal with Microsoft (MSFT) that could be valued as much as $19.4 billion. Microsoft agreed to pay the Nvidia-backed (NVDA) firm, which completed its split from Russian internet giant Yandex last year, $17.4 billion over five years to provide artificial intelligence infrastructure for a new data center in New Jersey. Microsoft “may also acquire additional services and/or capacity” for another $2 billion under the agreement. Founder and CEO Arkady Volozh said this was the first of what Nebius expects will be “significant long-term committed contracts with leading AI labs and big tech companies.” With Tuesday's surge, Nebius shares have more than tripled in value since the start of the year. Microsoft shares were up less than 1% in recent trading and have added close to 20% year-to-date.

Title: Will Apple’s new iPhones cost more? Here’s what to expect from today’s unveiling

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Technology Writer CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) — Apple on Tuesday rolled out its next generation of iPhones that includes a new ultra-thin model and a slight price hike for one of its high-end models, while the company feels the squeeze of a global trade war. The iPhone 17 line-up includes a new slimmed-down model that will adopt the “Air” name that Apple already uses for its sleekest iPads and Mac computers. In what has become an annual rite for Apple, all four new iPhone 17 models will feature better cameras and longer-lasting batteries than last year’s line-up. The iPhone 17 will all boast at least 256 gigabytes of storage, doubling the minimum amount from the last generation. “We are raising the bar again,” Apple CEO Tim Cook boasted in front of a crowd gathered in an auditorium named after the company’s late co-founder, Steve Jobs, located on its campus in Cupertino, California. The new iPhones are the first to be released since President Donald Trump returned to the White House and unleashed a barrage of tariffs, in what his administration says is an attempt to bring overseas manufacturing back to the U.S. — a crusade that has thrust Cook into the hot seat. All the iPhone 17 models are still expected to be made in Apple’s manufacturing hubs in China and India, exposing them to some of Trump’s tariffs. Analysts believe the additional fees on iPhones coming into the U.S. increase the pressure on Apple to raise prices to help protect its profit margins on its most marquee product. Without giving a specific reason, Apple will charge $1,100 for the iPhone 17 Pro, an increase of $100, or 10%, from previous versions of that model. The iPhone Air will start at $1,000 — the price of last year’s iPhone 16 Pro. Apple is sticking with the same starting price for the basic iPhone 17 at $800 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max at $1,200. All four models will be in stores Sept. 19. Apple’s shares fell nearly 2% in Tuesday’s late afternoon trading. In a move aimed at the selfie culture, the iPhone 17 models will feature a front camera with more megapixels for crisper photos. The front camera will also have an option called “Center Stage” that will take advantage of a wider view of field and a new sensor that will enable users to take landscape photos without having to rotate the iPhone. Although most of the upgrades to the iPhone 17 are similar to the incremental improvements of recent years, Apple appears to have done enough to “bring a sense of newness to the iPhone, which has remained the same for too long,” said PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore. While the iPhone 16 released last year fared reasonably well, the models didn’t sell quite as well as analysts had anticipated because Apple failed to deliver all of the artificial intelligence features it had promised, including a smarter and more versatile Siri assistant. The Siri improvements have been pushed back until next year. The global trade war has compounded Apple’s challenges. Both Trump and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have repeatedly insisted that iPhones be made in the U.S. instead of overseas. It’s an unrealistic demand that analysts say would take years to pull off and would result in a doubling, or even a tripling, of the iPhone’s current average price of about $1,000. Cook tried to placate Trump by initially pledging that Apple would invest $500 billion i n the U.S. over the next four years, and then upped the ante last month by adding another $100 billion to the commitment. He also gifted Trump a statue featuring a 24-karat gold base. That kind of diplomacy has helped insulate Apple from Trump’s most severe tariffs. However, with the iPhones being brought into the U.S. still facing duties of about 25%, some analysts speculated the company would raise prices to help preserve the its heft profit margins. But for the most part, Apple — and even rivals such as Google — is sticking with the same price tags it’s slapped on its newest iPhones over recent years. Although Apple’s stock price is still down by 4% so far this year, the shares have been bouncing back in recent months amid signs it won’t be as hard hit by the tariffs as once feared, and a highly anticipated court ruling cleared the way for the company to continue receiving $20 billion annually to lock in Google’s search engine as the default option on iPhones.

Title: Elon Musk’s Trillion-Dollar Pay Package Is Just Bad Corporate Governance

Time Published: 2025-09-09T13:20:53Z
Full Content:
Yale SOM leadership expert Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and co-author Stephen Henriques write that the gargantuan package proposed by Tesla—based on a series of implausible performance targets—suggests a board in thrall to its charismatic, erratic CEO. Elon Musk at the grand opening of the Tesla Giga Texas plant in 2022. This commentary originally appeared in Fortune. The views expressed are the author’s own. Elon Musk has once again captured media attention. This time, however, it isn’t a rogue X rant or embittered comments about President Trump’s abuse of executive authority. Instead, a proposed $1 trillion pay package crafted by Tesla’s board and Musk has grabbed headlines. The proposed scheme is ludicrous not only in terms of the highly aspirational 12 milestones that would unlock the benefits, but also in terms of good governance practice. Even needing to support 14 children with four different mothers, how much capital does Musk need? The argument that Musk needs additional incentive to lead Tesla to new heights runs entirely counter to the fact that he owns nearly 20% of the company’s outstanding shares and will already be well rewarded from any upside in the company’s performance. If Tesla were to achieve an $8.5 trillion market cap, as outlined by one of the pay package milestones, Musk would be worth over $1.6 trillion, based on that current ownership stake. Musk is the richest person in the world (or second if you believe that number one is Vladimir Putin), and nearly twice as wealthy as the individuals ranked third and fourth, Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg, respectively. Estimated to be worth over $437 billion, none of Musk’s lifestyle, resources, or influence will meaningfully change from any material increase in wealth. After threatening to walk away from Tesla earlier this year, Musk received a $30 billion pay package after a federal judge denied him a $50 billion package. It is shameful for Musk to now be holding shareholders hostage to suit his need for power. Renowned founders such as Bernie Marcus of Home Depot, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Michael Dell of Dell Technologies, Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone, Sam Walton of Walmart, and Larry Fink of BlackRock never fabricated shakedown strategies like this to regain more control of their companies after they went public. Moreover, should Musk act on his threat and leave Tesla, he would be the biggest loser as the largest shareholder of the biggest meme stock in financial market history. Tesla has a P/E ratio of over 200x, compared to the world’s most valuable company, Nvidia, at nearly 50x, so a 50% drop in the existing Tesla market cap of $1.1 trillion would result in a $110 billion loss in paper wealth, a quarter of Musk’s estimated worth. The performance milestones in the proposed pay package are both illusional and delusional. According to the proposal, Tesla is required to deliver 20 million vehicles, a significant increase from the 1.8 million delivered in 2024. The company must also distribute one million robots. They have not even developed a fully functional humanoid robot. Additional benchmarks require one million robotaxis to be placed into commercial operation, versus 30 on the roads today, and 10 million subscribers for its Full Self Driving service, compared to approximately 1 million in 2024. Most jarring are the mandates for the company to more than double the $4 trillion market cap of Nvidia and to notch $400 billion of adjusted EBITDA, versus $16.65 billion in 2024. Despite the absurdity of the performance package, the federal government does not need to intervene, as it has been so inclined to do lately. If stockholders do not like the proposed pay package, then they will vote against the proposal or sell their stock holdings. Of course, shareholders, not the government, should be asking important questions—of which there are many—about the necessity for such a rich payout and high ownership stake. One of those burning questions: If Musk preferred maintaining so much control, then why did he take Tesla public? The centrality of the chief executive to the success of the company is far more symbolic in the eyes of tech bros than it is substantive in the eyes of the average customer. In fact, as of late, he has been the most detrimental factor to the Tesla sales pipeline, which is on track to fall for the second year in a row. Sales in Europe have notably fallen by 40% year-over-year, ceding its dominant market position to Chinese EV automaker BYD for the first time. The Chinese market has been just as challenging for Tesla, which has experienced repeated sales declines over several months this year and has yielded more than half its market share to competitors since 2021. Many Tesla enthusiasts would be surprised to know that Musk did not create Tesla, but he squeezed out its first CEO, co-founder Martin Eberhard, along with Tesla’s other co-founder Marc Tarpenning. They were the ones who named the company for the brilliant, penniless inventor of alternating currents, wireless remote controls, and X-rays in 2003. The plunging sales of Telsa have been directly linked to a global consumer backlash after Musk’s endorsement of the German AFD party—considered a Nazi apologist group—and a U.S. consumer backlash against his DOGE initiative, a tornado of cruel, dangerous, self-interested destruction of vital federal agencies, in partisan service to President Trump. While Musk may be the greatest inventor of our time, his magic wand is overhyped. Most of his private companies, such as Neuralink, The Boring Company, X/Twitter, and SolarCity, have been a bust or seen lackluster performance. Solar City was a failure that got jammed down the throats of unrelated Tesla shareholders. It would take a lot of nerve to celebrate the delayed success of Neuralink. X/Twitter’s value collapsed after Musk took control. At least there is truth in advertising for the Boring Company. It lives up to its name by failing to connect the scores of cities with high speed tunnels that were promised years ago. SpaceX has seen success primarily due to a stable flow of government contracts and subsidies, and the steady operating hand of president and chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell. xAI has potential but its Grok chatbot raised many concerns when it began spewing pro-Nazi/Hitler and antisemitic pronouncements soon after Musk tampered with the large language model’s algorithm. The board is suffering from what political scientists and psychologists call “groupthink,” psychiatrists label folie à deux, social workers call “codependence,” and normal people recognize as an infatuation with a charismatic, cultish powerful figure. We have seen this happen before at Viacom with Sumner Redstone and CBS with Bill Paley. We’ve seen it with Ken Olsen at Digital Equipment Corporation, once the world’s second-largest tech company but no longer in business. And we saw it with Juan Trippe at Pan American World Airways, the now-defunct pioneer of transoceanic travel that was once America’s flagship carrier. The original nationwide coffee house pioneer, William Black, ran the Chock full O’Nuts chain that he founded into his mid-80s when he was flat on his back in the hospital while his full-time physician and lifelong friend served as the president. Those boards followed such charismatic CEOs, who lived on the edge, until they ran right off the cliff.

Title: Real-World Assets Nearly Died. Now They’re Soaring In Crypto

BySandy Peng, Contributor. For years, tokenization was where good ideas went to die. Hundreds of projects promised to change the financial world forever, by putting real estate, stocks, and commodities on different blockchains. But by 2021, over 90% had failed to achieve meaningful trading volume, with many industry insiders writing post-mortems, and investors moving on. The experiment, it seemed, was over. Then, something strange started to happen. While everyone turned their heads to Capitol Hill in the hopes of regulations clearing, tokenized RWAs grew from $5 billion to $24 billion in just two years. It seemed that the years of failed experiments didn’t stop the idea – but refined it instead. Some argue this is only the beginning. While most RWAs today see limited transaction volume, their long-term implications could be transformative. As assets from real estate to commodities and intellectual property move onchain, we may edge closer to a system where value is swapped directly for value, a modern form of digital bartering. In such a world, dollar-denominated settlements in global trade could diminish, especially as AI-driven financial coordination accelerates. Last month, in July 2025, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group acquired a ¥100 billion office tower in Osaka. The bank’s plan was unusual: convert the entire 30-story building into onchain tokens. Soon, retail investors will be able to buy fractional ownership, with institutional allocations handled via Japan’s digital securities rails (Progmat/STs). Every transaction will settle in seconds, and every ownership transfer will carry full legal weight under Japan’s security-token framework. What happened in Osaka represents one of largest single-asset tokenizations in history. At the same time, this news headline led to many people looking into RWAs again – and discovering their quiet, but explosive growth. RWA tokenization expanded from $5B (2022) to ~$24B (June 2025), a ~380% surge, outpaced only by stablecoins. And the growth doesn’t stop there - Boston Consulting Group projects $16T market by 2030; while Standard Chartered projects $30.1T by 2034. Even a fraction of these numbers would reshape how value moves through the global economy. The St. Regis Aspen resort was one of the first examples of tokenizing real estate. In 2018, the luxury hotel sold $18M of tokens to accredited investors. The tokens then closed at $1.32 on their first trading day (up 32% from the $1.00 offering price). Yet, the liquidity dwindled quickly – by 2020 the tokenized-real-estate market saw anemic volumes. The concept made sense, the execution didn’t. Aspen buyers owned shares in an intermediate entity, not the property directly, with stacked SPV structures, extra fees, and unclear rights. Next was Harbor’s $20M student-housing tokenization, which secured approvals but struggled to find sustained investor demand. The Hub consisted of a premier off-campus and student housing at the University of South Carolina. Equity in the property was divided into 955 shares (as tokens) priced at $21,000 each. However, the project failed after the lender blocked it, due to legal conflicts with mortgage terms. By 2021, observers noted that <10% of tokenized real-estate projects showed meaningful secondary trading. Three failures defined the first wave: (1) legal non-recognition of tokenized title, (2) tiny accredited-only investor pools with $10k+ minimums, and (3) no market-maker/liquidity infrastructure. By 2022, it was clear – in order for tokenization to survive and for the market to attract more novel use cases, these foundations would have to be fixed. Dubai addressed core problems first, proposing a direct property tokenization model with improved legal recognition. The Dubai Land Department launched Prypco Mint in May 2025 – minimums started at AED 2,000 (~$540), with token transfers synced directly to government land records. The agency itself projects tokenized real estate could reach AED 60B (~$16B), about 7% of all transactions, by 2033. Early offerings sold out rapidly. Behind the scenes, Japan followed with clear security-token rules: since 2021, the country has recorded dozens of tokenized real-estate and bond issues under its ST regime, paving the way for MUFG’s ¥100B tower. Technical rails needed to adapt in parallel in order to allow the masses to participate in more tokenization events. Chainlink launched real-time Data Streams for U.S. equities/ETFs across 37 blockchains, which was critical for pricing tokenized stocks/bonds onchain. Then, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon launched tokenized money-market fund shares on a private chain, covering funds from managers like BlackRock and Fidelity – a key bridge for a $7T asset class. Most importantly, tokenized assets found buyers in DeFi. MakerDAO has at times held >$1B in real-world assets backing DAI, with RWAs contributing the majority of revenue. Ondo Finance attracted ~$650M AUM and ~15,000 holders in USDY (as of mid-2025), making tokenized T-bill yield accessible outside the US. Composability solved the early liquidity problem: tokens could serve as collateral, move across venues, and generate yield. Larry Fink was right when he declared tokenization "the next generation for markets" in 2022. But the shift over the past few years looks different than how most expected. Rather than disrupting traditional finance through confrontation, tokenization is being absorbed and deployed by incumbents themselves. When MUFG tokenizes a $681 million building, when Goldman creates blockchain-based money market funds, when BlackRock engineers MakerDAO’s Treasury investments, they've acknowledged something that has been hiding in plain sight. The current system, with its settlement delays, access restrictions, and operational friction, has become competitively disadvantaged. The objections that stopped earlier attempts are now dissolving. The SEC’s Project Crypto explicitly aims to facilitate tokenized securities trading on decentralized platforms. Major custodians like BNY Mellon are managing tokenized funds, giving institutional blessing to the concept. The infrastructure now handles everything from compliance to price discovery to secondary trading. Yet perhaps the most significant shift is competitive pressure. Every asset that remains exclusively offchain becomes less liquid, less accessible, and more expensive to trade relative to tokenized alternatives. Financial institutions that resist tokenization risk watching their assets and services become obsolete. Stocks, bonds, and real estate were just the beginning. Even more interesting use cases will be happening at the edges – as more variety of assets is brought into the onchain world. One example worth highlighting is Project Mocha, who are building on Scroll – a blockchain that I co-founded, which tokenizes individual coffee trees in Kenya. Their model allows coffee lovers to directly invest in coffee trees, funding farmers who need upfront capital to allocate for faster farm growth, whilst also getting a share of the revenue. Similar approaches are emerging for solar farms sharing energy revenue, cargo containers generating shipping fees, and even music royalties flowing directly to fans. Today’s $24 billion in tokenized assets represents less than 0.01% of global wealth. The surface has barely been scratched. But the trajectory points clearly toward a future where every asset (whether it is stocks or real estate) exists natively onchain. The question facing every financial institution, every asset manager, every investor, is simple: How quickly can you adapt to a world where everything is tokenized? Because ready or not, that world is arriving.

Title: An iPhone event unlike the others: Apple is betting the house on hardware to weather the AI storm

Dave Smith is a writer and editor who previously has been published in Business Insider, Newsweek, ABC News, and USA TODAY. Apple’s “Awe Dropping” event has wrapped—and the focus of Tuesday’s show was mobile devices: the iPhone, the Watch, and AirPods. In total, Apple unveiled eight new products, including a brand-new member of the iPhone family, the iPhone Air. Here’s a look at everything that was announced, in order of when it was announced during the show. Apple redesigned AirPods Pro so they’re smaller and match more ears; Apple calls them the best-fitting AirPods ever. Apple also improved the audio with a wider soundstage and, more importantly, better active noise cancellation. Advanced computational audio, and new ear tips, offer better noise isolation—twice the ANC compared to the previous generation, and the best ANC in any wireless in-ear headphones, Apple promises, calling it over-the-ear performance in a pocket-sized design. Apple AirPods Pro 3 also supports live translation, so it can help you understand audio in your preferred language, say, if you’re wandering around a foreign country. ANC lowers the volume of the person speaking so it’s easier to focus on the translation. And it doesn’t just translate individual words, but complete phrases, so you can just speak naturally. Your phone will translate your words into their spoken language, if needed—and Apple says live language translation is even more powerful if both users are wearing AirPods Pro 3. AirPods Pro 3 also has a heart-rate sensor built-in. Thanks to the Apple Heart and Movement Study, which had over 250,000 participants, you can track up to 50 different workout types using just your headphones; no Watch necessary. You can track calories burned, and heart rate, using just your headphones and your phone’s Fitness app. Apple also promises more battery life: 8 hours on a single charge, up from 6. And, in transparency mode, when used as a hearing aid, AirPods Pro 3 can support up to 10 hours of battery life. Apple calls the Series 11 the most durable scratch-resistant Watch ever. It has more 5G coverage, is more battery-efficient, and comes with WatchOS 26 and the Liquid Glass design overhaul that comes with it. Series 11 also comes with new health features, including Health, Hearing, Cycle Tracking, Mental Health, and more. The Apple Watch Series 11 is attacking hypertension, also known as high blood pressure. Using data from the optical heart sensor, the Watch looks for high blood pressure over 30-day periods and will alert you if it spots patterns of hypertension. It won’t detect all instances, but Apple expects to notify over 1 million people of hypertension in the next year. It’ll be available in 150 regions this month, including the U.S. and Europe. Apple Watch Series 11 will also help you understand the quality of your sleep, thanks to a new Sleep Score feature. It can tell you about how long you slept, how it compares against your average, and measure any interruptions. Notably, the Apple Watch Series 11 has improved battery life: up to 24 hours. It comes in four colors: black, silver, gold, and space gray. There are new band colors and styles from Apple and Nike, and a new Hermes knit band with a special watch face that plays cute little animations. Apple Watch Series 11 starts at $399. Apple also debuted a new Watch SE, called SE 3, which is the entry-level Watch the company sells. It comes with an always-on display for the first time, supports gestures so you can control the Watch with just one hand, offers wrist-temperature sensing (for women’s health in particular), and can play music through side speakers. It also supports fast charging for the first time, which means it’ll charge twice as fast as the last SE: 15 minutes of charging will give you 8 hours of life. It starts at $249. Apple’s highest-end Watch has an improved display that’s brighter when viewed at an angle, and thinner borders so you have a bigger screen without Apple needing to change the case size, making for the biggest Apple Watch display ever. It comes with better 5G support, but also satellite connectivity, so you can get emergency help you need, or send messages or share your location, even in remote areas. Apple doubled the signal strength so you can communicate with satellites 800 miles above Earth. Ultra 3 also comes with a larger battery that offers up to 42 hours of life. It comes in black and natural titanium colors, has new bands, and a rubber series of bands from Hermes. Apple Watch Ultra starts at $799. The iPhone 17 now features a 120 Hz ProMotion display, a feature previously reserved for the Pro iPhone models, which makes actions look and feel smooth. It also features an always-on display, and is the brightest screen ever and has less glare thanks to a 7-layer anti-reflective coating. It comes in five colors: white, black, green, purple, and blue. It also has the best scratch resistance in an iPhone. iPhone 17 is powered by an A19 chip, made with 3-nanometer technology, plus an improved neural engine for Apple Intelligence and higher memory bandwidth to make large language models run faster. It also has improved fast charging, so just 20 minutes of charge will give you 8 hours of video time. The iPhone 17 features a rear dual-camera system on the back. The ultra-wide camera now has a 48-megapixel lens, four times the resolution compared to the previous ultra-wide lens on the iPhone 16. On the front, Apple introduces Center Stage for its selfie camera with a sensor that’s almost twice the size of the previous iPhone 16 front-facing cam, allowing for high-resolution photos and videos in any orientation so you don’t need to rotate your iPhone to take a landscape selfie anymore. You can just tap your screen to go from landscape to portrait—and when it sees a lot of subjects on your screen, it automatically adjusts the camera to accommodate everyone. The iPhone 17 starts with 256 GB of storage on board. It starts at $799. You can learn more about it right here. It starts at $999. The 6.3-inch iPhone 17 Pro and 6.9-inch Pro Max is all about power. Apple used aerospace-grade aluminum alloy, for improved thermal conductivity, which also makes the phone significantly lighter to hold. It comes in silver, deep blue, and “cosmic orange.” Improved thermals also makes room for a bigger battery and better antenna system. Everything is done to unlock the potential of the A19 Pro, which is specially built for AI workloads. It has 40% better sustained performance than iPhone 16 Pro, according to Apple. Apple is now using ceramic shield, instead of glass, for the back, which is four times more resistant to cracks and allows for a thinner profile, which, again, allows room for a bigger battery. A 7-layer antireflective coating also makes the phone better in bright lighting conditions. Okay, so about that battery. It has the best life in any iPhone. For eSIM-only models, the battery is even bigger, giving you an additional 2 hours of additional video playback per charge, giving you 39 total hours of video playback. The iPhone 17 Pro camera system is highly versatile: It features a sensor that’s 56% larger than the previous generation, which allows for more light and detail in photos. Thanks to its 8X telephoto lens, Apple uses machine learning to preserve natural details, reduce noise, and result in significantly improved color accuracy, especially in low light. Apple is also adding support for ProRes RAW capture, the industry-leading Apple video codec that captures all the information from the camera sensor for post-production, ensuring control and quality. Apple said its entire presentation was actually shot with an iPhone 17 Pro camera. It also supports some nifty features like Genlock, which allows you to use multiple cameras to shoot motion at the same time so you can capture cool bullet-time effects. A new TechWoven case is available for the iPhone 17 Pro, as well as clear cases and colors in silicone. Yes, it also comes with a new body strap in case you want to wear your phone. The iPhone 17 Pro starts at $1,099, and the Pro Max starts at $1,199. These product announcements come as Apple faces a ton of pressure from AI-hungry analysts, who aren’t thrilled with the pace at which Apple is bolstering its Apple Intelligence offering. For further context: Despite solid financial results, including record revenue in Q3, up 10% year-over-year, Apple’s had a mixed year in the markets as investor concerns about Apple’s AI capabilities have applied pressure on its stock. Apple, in case you don’t know, has chosen to pursue baking AI into its full software ecosystem that extends across devices rather than create a standalone app like ChatGPT or Claude or Perplexity, which you can access in dedicated apps and websites including, notably, on non-Apple devices. On top of that, Apple admitted earlier this year at its Worldwide Developers Conference that its promised Siri overhaul for this year wouldn’t arrive until 2026. That delay cost Apple roughly $75 billion in market value in a single day and prompted some analysts to question CEO Tim Cook’s leadership. All of this to say: Wall Street is absolutely zeroed in on the AI gold rush right now and has grown impatient with Apple’s timeline on this front. What’s more, Apple says it’s facing an estimated $1.1 billion impact from tariffs in fiscal Q4 2025, adding cost pressures as it navigates component price increases. Goldman Sachs expects iPhone sales to grow 5% in fiscal 2025 and accelerate to 7% in 2026, assuming successful execution of today’s rumored product launches. Analyst sentiment remains mixed. While Goldman maintained its buy rating, MoffettNathanson argued that 30 times next year’s earnings is expensive for a company with “solid but not exceptional” growth prospects. The consensus among 31 Wall Street analysts shows a moderate buy rating. Apple’s strategy appears centered on hardware innovation bridging the gap until AI capabilities mature in 2026. But this approach carries inherent risks: if these products fail to drive expected upgrade cycles, the company could face continued underperformance relative to its AI-obsessed peers in Silicon Valley, many of whom are advancing their strategies and technologies more aggressively than Apple. Meta, OpenAI, Microsoft and others are pouring billions into AI facilities, and talent—and soon, hardware. Success for Apple would depend on whether consumers will accept higher prices for incremental improvements while Apple develops its next generation of software capabilities.

Stock futures are slightly higher this morning after the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite hit a new record high on Monday, as stocks rallied amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon. The benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average come into today's session just below all-time highs of their own. Bitcoin (BTCUSD), which has been under pressure in recent weeks, is up slightly at $112,500. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is ticking higher after hitting its lowest level since April yesterday, while gold and oil futures are also edging upwards in early trading. (Read Investopedia's real-time markets coverage here.) Nebius Group (NBIS) shares are up more than 50% in premarket trading after the AI infrastructure company announced a multi-year deal with Microsoft (MSFT). Amsterdam-based Nebius will provide Microsoft with dedicated capacity at its new data center in Vineland, New Jersey starting later this year, the company said. CNBC reported the deal was worth $19.4 billion. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) owns a stake in Nebius. “The deal will also help us to accelerate the growth of our AI cloud business even further in 2026 and beyond,” said Nebius CEO Arkady Volozh. Microsoft and Nvidia shares inched higher in premarket trading. A deal has been reached to end the yearslong fight over control of the media empire founded by Rupert Murdoch that includes Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. Lachlan Murdoch, who is the CEO of Fox (FOX) and chair of News Corp (NWS), will take control of the trust that holds sizable stakes in both of his father’s companies. As part of the deal, Rupert Murdoch’s children Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch and James Murdoch will end their claim to the company. Shares of Fox and News Corp were each down nearly 5% in recent premarket trading. Investors are awaiting quarterly results from Oracle (ORCL), which are scheduled to be released after markets close today. The cloud computing giant is expected to post a 13% year-over-year jump in quarterly revenue to $15 billion, according to analysts tracked by Visible Alpha. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase to $1.48. The report comes after Oracle shares hit an all-time-high earlier this year on the announcement of $30 billion in new cloud deals. The stock, which has gained more than 40% since the start of 2025, was up about 1% in premarket trading. Mining firms Teck Resources (TECK) and Anglo American have agreed to merge to form a new global minerals company that will be one of the world’s largest producers of copper. The new company, to be called Anglo Teck, will have a combined market capitalization of more than $53 billion. “Anglo Teck will hold an industry-leading portfolio of producing operations, including six world-class copper assets, alongside high-quality premium iron ore and zinc businesses,” Teck said in a release. Shares of Canada-based Teck Resources were up about 17% in premarket trading, while U.K.-based Anglo American gained about 8% in London trading.

VideoVerse’s clients include the Indian Premier League and Women’s Premier League (cricket) tournaments, FIFA+, and broadcasters Nippon TV and Clubber TV. Mumbai-based VideoVerse was founded in 2016 by Vinayak Shrivastav, Saket Dandotia, and Alok Patil. The company is backed by Bluestone Equity Partners, A91 Partners (a fund by former Sequoia India execs), Alpha Wave, Evolvence India, and Moneta Ventures, and have raised $105 million in funding to date. While Minute Media or VideoVerse didn’t provide a valuation for the deal, sources told TechCrunch that VideoVerse was valued between $200 million and $250 million during its last round in 2023, and Minute Media’s deal was in a similar range. Minute Media CEO Asaf Peled said that VideoVerse’s acquisition is the biggest for the company in terms of both value and company size. Minute Media has largely grown through strategic mergers and acquisitions, including The Players’ Tribune, FanSided, Mental Floss, and STN Video. Shrivastav said that in its initial days, VideoVerse built multiple AI tools, including one to detect smoking and drinking, which was helpful for the Indian sensor board to flag certain scenes for movie certification. It also worked on object identification and deployed that tech for e-commerce sites for identifying items in a video. However, the startup transitioned to building video editing and detection tools for sports broadcasters. “In 2016, Hotstar (which is now owned by Jio) was growing, and they were looking for a solution that could identify certain action points in sports and primarily in cricket,” Shrivastav said about starting its sports journey. A few years later, VideoVerse dropped its other products and concentrated on video-editing features for sports content. The company said that it operates like a SaaS tool for which it charges based on the number of hours of footage a broadcaster or streaming service wants to process. The company said it has grown to $65 million in revenue and a healthy EBIDTA margin of 35% to 40%. The company’s chief strategy officer, Prateek Sharma, said that VideoVerse has launched new AI-powered tools in the last few months that let its clients define rules to automatically generate content. For instance, for a basketball game, a broadcaster can create a package for all three-pointers scored by a particular player and automatically publish it on social media. The platform has also added AI-powered translation features to let sports properties reach fans across the globe. Sharma noted that while the platform uses third-party models in its AI workflows, the company uses its own core model to identify key moments in a game. Minute Media’s main reason behind the acquisition is to use VideoVerse’s tech and its own publisher network to better distribute content across various sports properties and generate ad revenue out of distributed content. The sports media company, which has raised $260 million according to Crunchbase data, said that the company reaches over 200 million monthly users through its properties. It also offers a B2B platform for content distribution, used by nearly 500 publishers. Minute Media’s Peled said that this presents a good opportunity to create more content through VideoVerse’s platform and monetize it. “With the VideoVerse acquisition, we can go to customers and pitch the AI suite, which is helpful for content creation. Then we can add our distribution and monetization capabilities on top of it to get more value out of the content,” Peled said. Minute Media wants to target more U.S.-based leagues with this new acquisition to get them to adopt the highlight-generating platform. Multiple reports suggest that fans are looking for a different kind of content outside traditional coverage, especially on their mobile phones. Minute Media is banking on AI to create that content. Peled said that while the company is not in an active funding round, it might look for more funds in the coming quarters for acquisitions.

Title: Microsoft continues layoffs with 42 more roles cut for the fifth month in a row — with an $80B reason behind it

The company is investing $80 billion in AI, but it faces criticism amid ongoing job eliminations in a shift towards automation. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It’s a new month, and unfortunately, that means even more layoffs at Microsoft. This time, it’s not thousands of employees, but just over 40 roles in Redmond (via Seattle Times). Even so, it marks the fifth consecutive month of job cuts in 2025, bringing the total to more than 15,000 employees since Microsoft announced its $80 billion AI investment commitment. The question now is whether these smaller September layoffs signal a slowdown, or if Microsoft plans to continue trimming staff month after month to make way for its AI-powered future. Microsoft at least appears to be following a trend regarding its layoffs. The latest round in Redmond targeted engineering, product management, and legal roles at its headquarters. The cuts are far smaller than earlier rounds — 6,000 jobs in May and 9,000 in July — but they still form part of Microsoft’s broader restructuring plan. This steady drip of layoffs suggests a deliberate effort to keep pressure on costs, even if the numbers are smaller. It raises an uncomfortable question: has Microsoft normalized monthly layoffs as part of its new way of operating? In 2025, Microsoft announced that $80 billion investment into AI — a $25 billion increase from the previous year. The money is going into data centers, custom chipsets, cloud expansion, and further development of tools like Copilot. Satya Nadella described this as the “enigma of success,” pointing to record profits but also the pressure to reduce costs. That tension is at the heart of recent criticism. The investment commitment came before the bulk of layoffs, creating frustration as Microsoft pushed ahead with massive spending while cutting thousands of jobs. At the same time, the company has been urging employees to rely more heavily on AI tools in their workflows. Microsoft also laid out 40 job roles at risk of being eliminated by AI. The layoffs also followed news that Microsoft had secured $6 billion in government savings over three years, adding to the perception that the cuts are less about financial necessity and more about long-term priorities. The bigger picture is clear: Microsoft is shifting resources to secure dominance in AI, not responding to immediate financial struggles. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Layoffs at Microsoft seem to be part of a bigger transformation, and it’s not all about saving money. Roles have been cut across key parts of the company, including Xbox, LinkedIn, engineering, legal, product management, research, support, and sales. At the same time, Microsoft is still hiring — but the focus has shifted. The company is bringing in talent for AI, machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and Copilot development. Satya Nadella has even said that a portion of Microsoft’s code is now written by AI, and I’ve noticed a new role floating around online: “professional vibe code cleaners” (via LinkedIn). I’d like to think anyone using AI to write code at Microsoft can actually code themselves, or at least I hope so. To balance this shift, Microsoft is also investing in reskilling. Its $4 billion “Elevate” program aims to help millions of people prepare for jobs in the AI era, reflecting a longer-term vision of how the workforce will evolve. Any round of layoffs, especially at Microsoft’s scale, creates anxiety and uncertainty. A culture of fear and job insecurity can quickly take hold. On top of that, employees face the added pressure of learning new AI tools just as those same tools are replacing traditional roles — something that understandably leaves a sour taste. This isn’t unique to Microsoft. Amazon, Meta, Google, and others are making similar AI-driven cuts. Workflows across the industry are shifting as companies double down on automation and AI-powered systems. The September layoffs are not an isolated event, but part of a broader transformation. Microsoft, and the tech sector as a whole, is clearly prioritizing AI, even if that means reshaping work in ways that feel deeply unsettling for many employees.

The new iPhones will be the first to be released since President Donald Trump returned to the White House and unleashed a barrage of tariffs, in what his administration says is an attempt to bring overseas manufacturing back to the US — a crusade that has thrust Apple CEO Tim Cook into the hot seat. If Apple follows the same naming scheme since the product's 2007 debut, the new models will be called the iPhone 17. But the Cupertino, California, company recently deviated from tradition with its naming formula for the iPhone operating system. When the next version of its iOS system was previewed at its developers conference in June, Apple revealed the free update will be called iOS 26 in reference to the upcoming year — a marketing technique that automakers have embraced for decades. Regardless, these new iPhones are still expected to be made in Apple's manufacturing hubs in China and India, much to the Trump administration's consternation. Both Trump and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have repeatedly insisted that iPhones be made in the US instead of overseas. It's an unrealistic demand that analysts say would take years to pull off and would result in a doubling, or even a tripling, of the iPhone's current average price of about $1,000. Cook tried to placate Trump by initially pledging that Apple would invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years and then upped the ante last month by adding another $100 billion to the commitment. He also gifted Trump a statue featuring a 24-karat gold base. That kind of diplomacy has helped insulate Apple from Trump's most severe tariffs. However, the iPhones being brought into the US still face duties of about 25 per cent, stoking speculation that the company will reveal its first across-the-board price increase in five years in an effort to preserve its hefty profit margins. Since 2020, Apple has charged $800 for its basic iPhone and $1,200 for its top offering, but analysts now believe the company may raise prices by $50 to $100 on some of the new models. If Apple does announce price increases, it will come just weeks after Google held steady on prices for its new Pixel smartphones. Whatever Apple ends up charging for the next iPhone, the new line-up isn't expected to be much different from last year's model — the first to be designed for a wide range of new artificial intelligence features. While the iPhone 16 has proven to be popular, the models didn't sell quite as well as analysts had anticipated because Apple failed to deliver all the AI-fueled improvements it had promised, including a smarter and more versatile Siri assistant. The Siri improvements have been pushed back until next year. That has lowered the expectations for this year's line-up, which will likely include the usual improvements in camera quality and battery life on top of a slightly redesigned appearance. The most significant new twist could be the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone dubbed “Air” — a moniker Apple already slaps on like its sleekest iPads and Mac computers. The relatively minor updates to recent iPhone models are raising questions about Apple's ability to innovate in the fast-moving era of AI, said Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. “Apple is reaching a tipping point, and I expect 2026 and 2027 to be pivotal years." Apple's AI follies, combined with its exposure in Trump's trade war, have weighed on the company's stock, while the market values of Big Tech peers like Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet have been surging. Although Apple's stock price is still down by 4 per cent so far this year, the shares have been bouncing back in recent months amid signs it won't be as hard hit by the tariffs as once feared, and a highly anticipated court ruling cleared the way for the company to continue receiving USD 20 billion annually to lock in Google's search engine as the default option on iPhones.

Title: Here's what happens when private equity buys homes in your neighborhood

Alex Mayyasi This comes from the Planet Money newsletter. Subscribe now to get more insights into how our economy works delivered to your inbox each week. Daniel Erb became a corporate landlord kind of by accident. It started in 2020, when he received his first bonus as an investment banker. It was more money than he was used to. He wanted to invest in real estate, so he called his cousin, a research analyst at BlackRock, for advice. As they talked over options, his cousin showed him a striking chart of the number of "housing starts" in the U.S. since 1950 (basically the number of new houses and apartments built each year). It showed that the last 10 years had the fewest starts since the 1960s, even though the U.S. population was now much larger. Loading... It was a full decade of underinvestment. They focused on single-family homes — the classic house with a yard, often in the suburbs. "I'm a millennial," says Erb. "I've always envisioned having a home." But none of his friends had bought a house yet. Neither had he. Contemplating this lack of new houses and rising demand from millennials like him, he saw "a big opportunity … something that I was willing to spend my career on." So Erb and his cousin raised money from investors, bought homes in places like the Chatham-Arch neighborhood in Indianapolis (which was affordable, had a growing population and was benefiting from redevelopment), and rented them out — presumably to people who wanted a house with a yard but couldn't afford to buy one. Erb says it was a profitable business. He was not the first New York finance person to profit from single-family rentals across the United States. The private equity firm Blackstone (commonly confused with BlackRock) more or less invented this buy-to-rent strategy in 2012, under the moniker Invitation Homes. It's now a public company valued at more than $18 billion. The response to this development — of Wall Street buying Main Street, or at least some of its cul-de-sacs — has been bipartisan, populist and patriotic condemnation. Both JD Vance and Kamala Harris called for bans on these corporate landlords. Since houses tend to rise in value over time, homeownership has been a primary way that middle-class families build wealth. But now private equity was outbidding aspiring homeowners, making it more expensive to buy a home and pocketing the appreciation in home values. Even some of Erb's friends told him they thought he was making homes unaffordable. "Nothing that has stuck with me or made me second-guess what I'm doing," he says. He wasn't responsible for the decade of underinvestment; he felt they were giving young couples the option to live in a house without breaking their bank account. "But, yeah, very emotional conversations." Now that these institutional investors have been buying and renting out houses for more than a decade, researchers have had time to study their impact. And they've found a surprising nuance. These investors can and do make homeownership harder to attain, just as their critics claim. But by providing rentals, they also make neighborhoods more affordable and more diverse. They are diversifying the suburbs. When institutional investors first started buying single-family homes, the U.S. government laid out the welcome mat. Before the Great Recession, major investors hadn't had much interest in the suburbs. In the early 2000s, a firm called Redbrick Partners tried buy-to-rent. It ultimately abandoned the effort. Unlike in an apartment building, its leadership noted, where corporate management is common, fixing faucets and other maintenance were much less efficient when dealing with geographically dispersed homes. But during the Great Recession — just before the decline of new starts in Erb's chart — the U.S. had a glut of single-family homes in foreclosure. Many were auctioned off en masse, including by the federal government, which organized auctions for investors like Blackstone and even provided a $1 billion loan guarantee to encourage Blackstone to buy. This allowed private equity firms (which raise money from wealthy families, pension funds and other organizations to seek out profits, often by buying private companies) and real estate investors to efficiently and cheaply buy, say, a dozen similar homes located in the same Phoenix suburb. This solved two big problems for these institutional investors. It reduced the "search costs" of finding suitable homes (often starter homes with three bedrooms), and it allowed them to buy similar homes clustered in one area (which ameliorated the dispersed-faucets problem). Blackstone then introduced a financial product that supercharged the buy-to-rent sector: the rent-backed security. It was a bond, or IOU. Investors bought them, providing Blackstone with more money to buy and renovate homes. In exchange, investors were entitled to a cut of future rent payments. Wall Street could now buy homes by paying with the rent they would collect in the future. Per the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the number of homes owned by Blackstone and similar firms increased from almost nothing in 2010 to around 400,000 by 2021. This is around when Erb and his cousin started buying homes. The batch auctions were long gone. But Erb says new technology allows companies like his to have a geographically dispersed portfolio of homes. The universality of listing platforms such as Redfin and Zillow keeps search costs down. Products like Ring cameras allow potential tenants to tour properties without being shown around by an agent. And software like Zoom has made it easier for them, like other executives, to manage a remote workforce. In 2012, many government officials had welcomed firms like Blackstone into the housing market because they worried about abandoned houses and saw rental conversions as a win. Today, though, institutional investors compete with middle-class families for starter homes. Is that why homeownership has gotten more expensive? As Kamala Harris and JD Vance were calling for bans on corporate landlords, Konhee Chang was a Ph.D. student in economics. Born in Korea, Chang had always rented while living in the U.S. but never the "quintessential house that I think of when I think about an American house," with a front yard and a backyard. He wanted to know why there were so few rentals in the suburbs and who would live there if renting was an option. Chang realized these investors' buy-to-rent strategy provided an ideal case study of what happens when more rentals are available. If someone had built new homes to rent out, that would increase the supply of homes, changing the neighborhood. But since they converted homes into rentals, only one variable had changed, like in an experiment. So Chang assembled and analyzed data on neighborhoods before and after corporate landlords showed up, including demographic data on the residents. His biggest finding? Institutional investors were reducing segregation. When private equity rented out homes, the new tenants tended to be lower income than the prior owners and more likely to be young and nonwhite. "I think I was most surprised by the fact that the effect was so sharp and immediate," says Chang, who has since earned his Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. He took it as a sign that these families really wanted to live in these areas but were prevented by the lack of rentals and their inability to get a mortgage. This is particularly notable because one of the most important economics findings of the past decade is the impact on children's development and career prospects of their hometown and neighborhood. (You can listen to a Planet Money episode on moving to opportunity here.) Suburban neighborhoods are not inherently better than rural or urban areas. But another study, for example, showed that single-family rentals in North Carolina served "as a pathway for access to high-performing public schools" for economically disadvantaged children. These results did not turn Chang into a cheerleader for private equity. He's too careful a scholar, and his results hold for rentals in general, regardless of whether the landlord is Invitation Homes or a couple down the street. Plus, he did not investigate other criticisms of corporate ownership. (For example, a Bloomberg investigation in 2013 found that Magnetar Capital LLC became the largest landlord in Huber Heights, Ohio, and then pushed for lower assessments of its properties' value. If it had succeeded, it would have been the largest property tax cut in county history, reducing the school district's budget by $800,000 a year.) Most of all, Chang found that the buy-to-rent strategy was hurting the middle class. Creating rentals aided lower-income families and nudged rents down. But reducing the supply of homes available for sale also pushed home prices up, hurting families on the cusp of homeownership. Erb says he feels good about the rental service they provide. (In 2024, he and his cousin teamed up with a veteran real estate investor to co-found a larger investment firm, Strand Capital.) But he agrees this trade-off exists. "There's always gonna be a cost and a benefit," he says. But the bigger problem for housing affordability, he adds, is that "we just haven't built enough [homes] to keep up with the population growth and household formation." "People get really riled up about this idea of private equity coming in and buying the block," says Daryl Fairweather. "I think they are kind of the boogeyman though." That's because institutional investors own a very small slice of single-family homes in the United States. As the chief economist at the real estate platform Redfin, Fairweather says investors purchase about 17% of homes. But most of those purchases are by mom-and-pop investors, not big firms like Blackstone. Institutional investors just don't own enough homes to be the main culprit for high home prices. In fact, Fairweather sees some societal benefits of institutional investors. Unlike with mom-and-pop landlords, it's easier to regulate large corporate landlords and check whether they are, say, following the Fair Housing Act. Plus, in places like Silicon Valley, where politicians are trying to address housing crises by encouraging the development of duplexes and triplexes, profit-driven institutional investors are a potential boon, since they're more likely to turn suburban homes into duplexes. And in areas with more open land, like the suburbs near Denver, institutional investors are building new housing specifically to rent out. Think cookie-cutter homes, perhaps with a dog park or pool. "I think that we should embrace investors who want to make those kinds of investments," Fairweather says. Still, she thinks middle-class families are right to worry about private equity displacing them from the housing market. She worries about fewer families achieving homeownership and gaining control over this intimate part of their lives, which has also been the dominant path to building wealth in America. But a ban? As an economist, she hates bans. If politicians succeed in banning corporate landlords, perhaps by making it illegal to own more than 300 homes, she suspects we'd see lots of 300-home companies replacing Blackstone — without doing anything to increase homeownership among the middle class. Instead, she advocates for policies that will incentivize and allow developers to build more housing. The trade-off caused by single-family rentals — that they benefit some low-income renters but hurt some aspiring homebuyers — is "because we are restricting the number of homes that can be built in neighborhoods." Many desirable neighborhoods are zoned so that it's impossible to build the duplexes or apartment buildings that would make them accessible to low-income families. Many prosperous towns block the building of new single-family homes, often at the behest of current homeowners who don't want to deal with construction or who want to restrict supply and boost their home's value. The best way to stick it to Blackstone and private equity, to prevent Wall Street firms from profiting off the housing crisis, is to make it easier to build more homes. As for Daniel Erb, even though he has spent his career responding to the dearth of suburban homes, betting on our collective underinvestment in American dream properties, he might appreciate that too. He says he doesn't own a home, in part because he often travels to the towns where his company buys homes. And he says he's not buying for himself at today's prices.

Title: Anticipation builds for Apple’s ‘awe dropping’ iPhone 17 reveal

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Good morning. Jeremy here again, filling in for Andrew, who is at Fortune Brainstorm Tech in Deer Valley, Utah. The conference kicked off yesterday, and man, I’ve got serious FOMO.Some highlights so far: But the big news in tech today, aside from what’s happening at Fortune Brainstorm Tech, of course, is anticipation around Apple’s big hardware reveal later today. iPhone fans—and Apple investors—have great expectations. Will Apple live up to them? Bea Nolan has a rundown below of what we might see unveiled. One thing analysts are cautioning we probably won’t see: a lot of those native AI features Apple has been promising iPhone users for more than a year now.Always leave ‘em wanting more may be good showbiz advice, but it might not do Apple’s share price any favors. —Jeremy Kahn Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Fortune Tech? Drop a line here. Apple is set to unveil its latest iPhone in an “awe-dropping” event later today. The company is hosting its annual product launch in Cupertino where it's slated to launch major hardware refreshes across its lineup and debut the brand new iPhone 17 family. The company is also expected to launch updates to the iPad Pro, Vision Pro headset, Apple TV, and HomePod mini and reveal the iPhone 17 Air, set to be the thinnest iPhone to date. Apple has been navigating a complex political environment, and some analysts expect the tech giant to raise prices on the Pro models as the company deals with a challenging tariff environment. Analysts have also cautioned against expecting a major AI announcement during the event. “Apple has already shared that a major Siri and Apple Intelligence revamp will only happen in 2026 and, timing-wise, it’s unlikely a major strategic investment in an AI firm would coincide with Apple’s keynote next week,” Forrester’s Thomas Husson noted. Instead, he said Apple is more likely to spotlight its new A19 Pro chip, which features a more powerful Neural Engine for on-device AI tasks like conversational models, advanced photo editing, and personalized suggestions. A fresh AI partnership with Google’s Gemini could also surface, building on last year’s tie-up with ChatGPT. The show kicks off at 10 a.m. PT. —Beatrice Nolan OpenAI is scrambling to salvage its corporate restructuring after facing unexpected opposition, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal report. The company is even considering the "nuclear option" of leaving California entirely, though a spokesperson denied any plans to relocate. The stakes couldn't be higher: about $19 billion in funding—nearly half of what OpenAI raised in the past year—depends on investors getting traditional equity in a new for-profit structure. Currently, OpenAI issues "profit participation units" instead of traditional stock, but investors want real equity. If the restructuring collapses, those investors can pull their money—a potentially catastrophic blow for a company planning to burn through $115 billion by 2029. OpenAI now faces a coalition of dozens of nonprofits, labor unions, and philanthropies opposing the move, plus a legal challenge from Elon Musk. Meta has been lobbying to block the deal too, the Journal reports. Both California and Delaware attorneys general are investigating the restructuring, with concerns about recent suicides linked to ChatGPT interactions complicating approval. Regulators are questioning whether OpenAI has abandoned its original public benefit mission for revenue. The AGs could sue or demand hefty settlements as conditions for approval. OpenAI executives didn't anticipate this backlash, according to the Journal, and are now scrambling to save the deal, hiring advisers with ties to Governor Newsom while pledging $50 million to community organizations.—Jeremy Kahn Two former and two current Meta employees have submitted documents to Congress alleging that Meta curtailed research into children’s safety, according to a report from The Washington Post. The employees allege that after Frances Haugen’s 2021 leaks, Meta quietly limited how staff could study sensitive issues like youth well-being, race, and harassment. They allege Meta’s lawyers advised researchers to avoid collecting data on minors and even urged them to run sensitive studies under attorney-client privilege. One researcher says he was ordered to delete an interview in which a teen described his 10-year-old brother being sexually propositioned in Horizon Worlds. Meta told news outlets the deletion was required under privacy law, citing rules that ban collecting information from children under 13 without verified parental consent. Meta has denied the rest of the claims, saying the allegations were “stitched together. The company also said it had approved nearly 180 Reality Labs-related studies on social issues, including youth safety and well-being, since 2022. A Senate subcommittee is set to review the whistleblowers’ claims this week. —Beatrice Nolan The judge overseeing Anthropic’s proposed settlement with authors has blasted the agreement as “nowhere close to complete.” Judge William Alsup said at a Monday hearing that he felt “misled” by the settlement proposal and had “an uneasy feeling about hangers on with all this money on the table.” He cited concerns about class lawyers striking a deal behind the scenes that will later be forced “down the throat of authors.” The motion to approve the deal was denied, and a post-hearing order stated that approval is postponed until more information is provided. Attorneys will now have to return with a revised settlement proposal. As part of this, the judge directed the parties to create a form requiring all copyright owners to opt in to the settlement; if any owner opts out, that work will be excluded. Judge Alsup set a September 15 deadline for submitting a final list of works, which currently stands at just under 500,000. The $1.5 billion settlement had already been touted as one of the largest copyright deals in U.S. history, and experts say it could establish a benchmark for similar cases. —Beatrice Nolan Anthropic endorses California’s AI safety bill. It’s the first major AI company to back the bill. Trump’s tech dinner triggers a MAGA backlash. Tech bosses spike tensions in MAGA land. SpaceX to acquire EchoStar Spectrum in $17B deal. The deal will allow EchoStar to resolve a regulatory probe. A former WhatsApp security chief has sued Meta, alleging ignored privacy risks. WhatsApp called the claims false and tied to poor performance. Google says the open web is already in “rapid decline.”The statement starkly contrasts Google’s recent claims about the health of web search. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Lululemon Stock: Buy The Dip Or Wait It Out?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/09/lululemon-stock-buy-the-dip-or-wait-it-out/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Lululemon stock (NASDAQ: LULU) has emerged as one of the more divisive names in the market for 2025. A mix of guidance reductions, tariff challenges, and decreasing product momentum has resulted in a 56% decline in shares year-to-date, while the S&P 500 has risen by 10%. This discrepancy raises an important question: has the market reacted excessively, or are the threats to growth and profitability more fundamental? Valuation introduces another dimension to this discussion. Once regarded as a high-growth premium brand, Lululemon is now trading at just 14 times trailing earnings, presenting a discount compared to its historical average and the market's 24 times multiple. Financially, the company continues to yield strong margins, returns on capital, and free cash flow. With a market cap of $20 billion and $1.4 billion in trailing free cash flow, the stock offers a cash flow yield of nearly 7%. When compared to competitors like Nike, this positioning seems appealing — although whether the multiple will adjust upward relies on management's capability to stimulate U.S. demand while managing rising costs. For investors who prefer lower volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio offers an alternative, having surpassed the S&P 500 and produced returns of over 91% since its launch. Additionally, check out Broadcom: AVGO Stock’s Path To $600 Lululemon exceeded earnings expectations with an EPS of $3.10 compared to estimates of $2.87, though revenue slightly missed at $2.53B against projections of $2.54B. The main issue, however, was the reduction in guidance. The company lowered its full-year revenue forecast to $10.85B–$11.0B (down from $11.15B–$11.3B) and EPS to $12.77–$12.97 (down from $14.58–$14.78). This adjustment, rather than the quarterly performance itself, caused the most recent selloff in the stock. Lululemon’s U.S. same-store sales in Q2 FY 2025 decreased by 4%, indicating ongoing weakness in its core domestic market. Conversely, same-store sales increased by 17% in China and by 12% across other international markets. Lululemon is contending with various challenges beyond its guidance. The elimination of the U.S. de minimis exemption will result in roughly $240 million in additional import duties, leading to an overall operating cost impact estimated at around $320 million by 2026. Management has also recognized brand fatigue, with CEO Calvin McDonald mentioning that the assortment has grown “too predictable.” To address this issue, the company intends to refresh its offerings, increasing the proportion of new styles from 23% to 35% by next spring. Lululemon concluded the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash, which represents 15.4% of total assets, against $1.7 billion in lease liabilities, its primary form of debt. This results in a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of merely 8.3%. With no traditional debt on the balance sheet and substantial liquidity, the company is well-equipped to withstand short-term disruptions without compromising its growth ambitions. There’s no denying it: Lululemon has a track record of significant declines during market corrections. It decreased by 46% in the downturn of 2022 (compared to the S&P’s 25%), fell 47% during the early 2020 Covid shock (versus 34%), and faced a severe drop of 92% in the 2008 crash (in contrast to 57%). Investors must recognize that with LULU, strong fundamentals do not always provide protection against sharp changes in sentiment. View LULU Dip Buyer Analyses to discover how the stock has bounced back from significant dips in the past. Lululemon’s fundamentals — solid margins, global growth, and a clean balance sheet — remain robust, while the stock’s valuation has adjusted to attractive levels. The business continues to be premium, but the price is no longer reflective of that. Investing in a single stock carries inherent risks. Alternatively, you might consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its benchmark consisting of all-cap stocks (a mix of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield significant returns for investors. What accounts for that? The quarterly rebalanced structure of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided an adaptable means to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as illustrated in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The Brain-Rotting Dystopia of Roblox

This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. I’ve arrived in the middle of a vast expanse of what looks like green LEGO plastic subdivided into fenced lots. Mozart’s “Turkish March” plays sourcelessly over a chorus of meowing cats and squeaking mice. A signpost with my name on it indicates that one of these lots of Gumby-colored virtual earth is mine, and it is embarrassingly barren. In contrast, the neighboring garden, belonging to a stranger going by Level12Arsonist, resembles a neon Eden, bulging with glowing vines, buzzing bugs, monkeys, and exotic fruits. I plant a carrot seed and wait for it to sprout. I’m informed I can buy a “bug egg” with funds drawn directly from my in-game checking account, though I have no idea exactly how much this costs or what it might do. Level12Arsonist, in a gesture of goodwill or perhaps pity, sends me a friend request. I am currently playing one of the most popular online video games on the planet. Grow a Garden, available on the app Roblox, is an exercise in patience. As the name suggests, the premise is almost Zen-like, requiring nothing more of players than planting seeds and waiting — and waiting some more — for them to mature. Then they harvest their crops, sell them for “Sheckles,” an in-game currency, and gradually reinvest their profits in more seeds and more waiting. Or they can simply spend real money on Robux, Roblox’s universal virtual currency, to skip the waiting altogether and transform their plot of land into a verdant oasis. Roblox features millions of such games, many of them generated by the very children who play them. Grow a Garden — essentially a remake of the legendary time-waster FarmVille — recently smashed Fortnite’s all-time popularity record for concurrent users; at one point this summer, roughly 22 million people were playing at the same time. Grow a Garden is outpacing prestige games with development budgets approaching those of Hollywood blockbusters, put to shame by Roblox’s blocky graphics, a blurry mix of Minecraft and South Park. Grow a Garden was created by an anonymous teenager. Despite, or perhaps because of, its primitivism, tens of millions of people around the planet love Roblox deeply, sincerely, and with more zeal than anyone loves just about anything else on the internet, their obsession spilling over into YouTube fan accounts, conferences, meetups, and a thriving industry of third-party coding studios. The platform’s popularity is staggering. In 2020, as Facebook continued to watch its share of the global adolescent attention span slide, Roblox told Bloomberg that “two-thirds of all U.S. kids between 9 and 12 years old use Roblox, and it’s played by a third of all Americans under the age of 16.” This year, Roblox reported 111.8 million average daily active users. Like many budding tech companies, it has yet to turn a profit, but it estimates it will end 2025 with around $4.5 billion in revenue and has a market capitalization of nearly $90 billion. Where Mark Zuckerberg’s efforts to create a “metaverse” failed so profoundly his company pretends it never tried in the first place, Roblox presses onward with a living and breathing metaverse that has developed organically over time and with much less Wall Street fanfare. Co-founder David Baszucki describes the company’s mission with a phrase that has the ring of early Facebook idealism: “Connecting a billion people every day with optimism and civility.” The reality of Roblox is less benevolent. It’s difficult to define this world, which is sprawling and diverse, with any precision. Brookhaven, which has been played more than 71 billion times and typically hosts 500,000 simultaneous players, offers gamers a virtual cityscape where they can act out fantasy lives as baristas, ICE officials, or simply pedestrians. Some games are hardly games at all; I spent longer than I will ever admit in a Roblox world consisting of nothing more than users waiting on a digital line for their turn to be cradled in the arms of an unlicensed Shrek sitting on a giant outhouse toilet. (Shrek Line, at the time I write this, has been played more than 25 million times.) Many popular Roblox games lean heavily into the “brain rot” cultural genre popular among internet-addled children with gameplay mechanics seemingly designed to be as incoherent or absurd as possible. Steal a Brainrot, for example, has gamers watch a procession of 3-D models based on Italian AI-slop memes that they can then buy and steal from one another as they avoid getting hit with baseball bats or slapped by giant hands. This game has been played more than 19 billion times, according to company metrics. Like any platform synonymous with children, Roblox has become associated with their predation. According to data compiled by Bloomberg Businessweek, between 2018 and 2024, more than two dozen adults have been arrested on suspicions of abducting or abusing victims they met or groomed using Roblox. In one notorious case, a New Jersey man was sentenced to 15 years in prison after Ubering a 15-year-old girl he’d met on Roblox to his home, where he repeatedly sexually abused her. In recent months, Roblox’s stock has been buffeted by reports that it will soon face hundreds of lawsuits alleging that it has facilitated the sexual exploitation of minors, even as it touts a raft of new safety features to protect children. Furthermore, because many of its games are created by children who often see little or no remuneration, Roblox has been accused of being a largely unregulated, multi-billion-dollar child-labor operation. These are serious problems. The bad headlines, however, can obscure other issues that may not be as sensational but are nonetheless widespread, affecting the teeming millions of children who hang out unsupervised in this vast playground. Despite heightened awareness of the dangers the screen life poses to children, parents seem largely unaware that Roblox is a wholly different animal from the usual smart-phone addiction. It’s a place where some of the most insidious trends of the contemporary internet — gambling, compulsive distraction, mindless consumption, and overall enshittification — have hardened into governing realities. Company executives say it’s a site for unparalleled creative expression. “At the very highest level, one of the things we believe about Roblox is it should be really easy to create,” VP of engineering Nick Tornow told me in an interview. “We believe in the creation of anything, anywhere, by anyone.” But what executives are less willing to acknowledge, at least among those who aren’t the company’s shareholders, is the degree to which this great unruly world created by children has since been engineered to hook them on gamified consumption. What Roblox most resembles is a mall — if a mall could be limitless, free of the confines of brick and mortar. The kids in this mall are ostensibly doing normal mall things, the stuff you may remember doing when you were that age: gossiping, listening to music, goofing around, shopping, trying on outfits — and being asked at every turn to pay for, say, plants for their garden. Roblox presents players with a lopsided choice: the thrill of watching a tomato plant grow, free of charge, or the instant gratification of a lush, instantly generated garden at a price. And there’s so much more: a virtual universe besieged by corporations and advertisers looking not only to make money but to embed themselves deep in children’s psyches. Even a few hours spent in the game’s various and ever-multiplying worlds is enough to make the shopping malls of old look like a Quaker youth retreat. The Robloxverse is a vision of hallucinatory hypercapitalism that dazzles and entertains as it extracts money from the young and inexperienced and impatient, immersing them in a degraded iteration of the internet where slop and the market and social media are totally integrated. Roblox’s legions of devoted fans see no such thing — only a chance to play, chat, and explore. It’s unclear whether Roblox executives, or the children’s parents, even care that this might be an illusion. Roblox was founded in 2004 by Baszucki, a Canadian American radio host turned software engineer, and Erik Cassel, who died from cancer in 2013, making Baszucki, now worth an estimated $7 billion, the company’s best-known executive. He has taken a quieter approach to tech billionairedom and has little apparent interest in immortality, combat sports, or dismantling the administrative state. In contrast with his more reptilian fellow chief executives in Silicon Valley, Baszucki is kindly and avuncular in public appearances, like a friendly bespectacled neighbor you would trust to watch your kid — or millions of kids. Baszucki envisions his metaverse eventually spreading to the worlds of work and family, but for now he is making progress on conquering fun. The software that eventually became Roblox was incubated in an early educational venture that Baszucki had hoped would teach schoolchildren about physics. The accessible design tools spawned something else; educational content can be found in certain remote corners of Roblox, but the prevailing vibe is recess chaos. And while some Roblox developers have crafted polished, visually impressive worlds, many of Roblox’s lo-fi games are jittery and glitchy even when running on modern hardware, at times so broken that this becomes a source of entertainment unto itself. What Baszucki stumbled on was the realization the future of gaming wasn’t pyrotechnic graphics and ever-more-complex gameplay but the opposite. Unlike more sophisticated platforms, Roblox is profoundly accessible. You can run it on virtually any phone, the family tablet, or an aging PC. The official Roblox system requirements ask only that your computer’s processor have been manufactured after 2005. Roblox is as easy to pick up and play as it is to install and run. It’s quick to download and quick to launch, and you can easily quit a game and switch to another. It’s a system that capitalizes on an inability to focus. “I think the biggest difference now between older gamers and younger gamers is attention span,” said Zakary Wilson, a Roblox developer at Epic-Studios.gg. “Short-form content has massively, for the worse, reduced younger people’s attention spans.” Wilson argued this trend partially explains the popularity of Roblox’s jump-in, jump-out games, in which plots and characters tend to be absent. Like a casino, a Roblox world is usually entered free of charge, which means the app has to earn money in other ways. One stream of revenue comes in the form of Robux, which is halfway between mining-town-company scrip and casino chips. No one is required to cough up their money, but those who opt not to pay find themselves subject to constant reminders of their choice: limited outfit selections, gameplay options locked behind timers, and hours grinding away on tedious tasks to earn in-game points that could be purchased outright. Whether optional boosts are viewed as actually optional depends on how much patience a child has. Roblox is far from the first tech company to force users to choose between spending money and a somewhat obstructed experience. But it’s unique in blowing out that dynamic to create an intricate alternative economy in which both individual developers and mega-corporations stand to profit. During a session inside an officially licensed Sonic the Hedgehog game, I found myself not launched into the exhilarating zooming, looping courses the franchise is famous for but standing in a starting area festooned with virtual billboards advertising ways to spend Robux. Before even getting to the part that could plausibly be described as a game, players must run past signs advertising a Character Sale, Mega Bundle, Legendary Spinner, Biker Shadow Bundle, Exclusive Nametag + Benefits, Chao Sale, Next World, Trading Hub, Daily Rewards, Chrome and Luminosity Golden Eggs, and new Friends and Trails. “Most Roblox game shops look a bit like Vegas stores,” Wilson told me. “They’re just very colorful and very bright and very liquid.” Some of these purchases, as is typical across Roblox, function more or less like kiddie roulette: As the name Legendary Spinner suggests, spending money here grants not even a desired virtual item or power-up but the chance to win a variety of different prizes. A great number of the accessories you can add to your in-game character to make it stand out from the other millions of players also require spending Robux. A MAKE ROBLOX GREAT AGAIN hat, complete with Trump signature, costs 95 Robux, while a wearable 3-D fish head paired with floating text reading DO YOU FART will set you back 55 Robux. An officially licensed pair of gold-laced Adidas sneakers will run you 34,200 Robux or about $130. In a 2023 Reddit thread, one parent asked Roblox users for help after claiming their 11-year-old spent $6,000 in roughly two weeks. The actual worth of Robux is difficult to quantify. The exchange rate shifts over time and varies depending on where you trade in your dollars: $4.99 will net you 400 Robux on a console or phone but 500 on a computer or over the web. For $10 a month, you can have a “Roblox Premium” membership, which grants monthly Robux payouts and a better exchange rate. Once you’ve converted it, sussing out how much real money an in-game item is worth requires constant arithmetic, operations that get only more complex in games that use multiple fake currencies at once. Grow a Garden’s Sheckles require ever-changing amounts of Robux, the cost of which in U.S. dollars will necessitate a calculator, preparing young gamers for a future in currency trading if not agriculture. Kids can make money on Roblox, too. Critics accuse the company of profiting from child labor, and to some extent this is true: Part of Roblox’s corporate revenue is derived from its take of money earned by children who build and sell virtual worlds and items, though Roblox notes that most developers are over 18 years old. On the unofficial Discord servers and message boards that host Roblox’s informal labor market, children and adults hire one another freely, paying either dollars or Robux. A developer who wished to remain anonymous given recent headlines about Roblox told me he started working on the platform as a teenager and learned a lot of lessons the hard way: “When you’re a kid, you hear a little bit of money, like $5, and you’re like, Damn, that’s a lot of money, right?” Some developers have gone on to achieve undeniably great success. Rush Bogin began playing Roblox at age 7 at the urging of his friends. While his classmates’ enthusiasm waned as they entered middle school, Bogin was developing an interest in the platform’s design-tool set. In 2018, Bogin and a group of friends made a game that managed, through sheer zoomer ingenuity and tenacity, to land on Roblox’s coveted front page of trending games. Bogin remembers with pride the moment he’d earned the minimum required of developers before they are allowed to convert their Robux into hard currency. In ninth grade, he was invited, along with a select group of developers, to join a program in which he could monetize his specialty 3-D creations and accessories. Crucially, this coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, creating a sudden wellspring of free time for Bogin and a flood of new and returning players to shop his wares. Early on, his accessories failed to grab attention. Bogin recalls waking early to check his overnight revenue. “I would always get really disappointed because it would probably get like five or six sales,” he said. “I just wasn’t doing well.” But as more and more people joined the platform, it became easier to generate viral hits. Rush launched one item — a “cute, winter beanie” — with no expectations. Suddenly, he woke to sales in the hundreds. Next, the beanie was the No. 1 virtual item on Roblox; today, Bogin says he has sold more than 2 million cute white winter beanies, which currently retail for 95 Robux, or about 35 cents. He now estimates he’s sold around 50 million virtual items, spanning a catalogue of 200-to-300 different pieces of clothing, hairstyles, and other customizations. Predators and corporate brands are drawn to Roblox for vastly different reasons, but there is one common draw: Kids are easy to influence, and they can easily be reached on the app. Fairplay, an organization that advocates against manipulative marketing practices aimed at children, has concluded that a commodified virtual world like Roblox owes its success in part to the decline of “third places,” the sociological term for spaces that are not our homes or the schools or offices we’re required to visit; parks, malls, and movie theaters are all examples of third places, many of them bulldozed by the advance of online commerce, social media, streaming, and other technologies that render the physical world obsolete. At the 2023 Roblox Developers Conference, executive Christina Wootton used tales of antiquity to underscore the platform’s positive contributions to society: “When I was younger, I used to hang out at the mall.” Malls are going extinct, she noted, but the dream lives on through Roblox. “People are together. They hang out. They shop. And we believe that social shopping is a massive opportunity for our community.” One Roblox executive I spoke to said the platform evoked childhood memories of spending their allowance at a neighborhood corner store. The shopping malls of old, of course, existed to facilitate commerce, but they also allowed for crucial real-world socialization absent from digital spaces. “I am not going to sit here and be like, ‘The place to go is the mall,’” Rachel Franz, a former teacher now working with Fairplay, told me in an interview. “But the real, documented psychosocial manipulation of children in virtual spaces — you can’t replicate that in real life because real life has consequences. And it has smells, and time exists differently, and there aren’t gambling wheels that pop up in front of you in order to buy your Nike shoes, but then you spin wrong because the chances are terrible and you end up getting a sticker. Sometimes those exist in real life in casinos, but that’s why we don’t have kids in casinos.” John Rutledge, a parent of three and a teacher at a Brooklyn private school, has seen firsthand how Roblox consumes the chatter of kids both between classes and back at home. “That kind of scares me a little bit,” he said. “It seems like Big Brother has too much control in a way. What Roblox is doing right now is they’re bringing these kids in and they’re just making consumers out of them.” Another parent in Brooklyn told me his 10-year-old daughter found games like Dress to Impress, in which you dress up avatars in clothes you purchase from an endless mall space, “relaxing” and “therapeutic,” the sort of thing you can do while talking to your friends either IRL or online. What’s most disconcerting about Roblox is how easily it smuggles rampant consumerism into a kid’s life, says Franz. As part of her work at Fairplay, she conducted focus groups with Roblox-playing children as young as 10 and was struck by how little kids don’t notice or mind that the platform works to serve the flow of capital to Roblox and famous brands. “Kids consistently called out unfairness when it comes to paying-to-win mechanisms and virtual assets that give people an advantage when they pay more money,” she told me. “There was a lot of talking about how that’s unfair and it makes the game less fun. At the same time, they love spending time on Roblox.” While older gamers still roll their eyes at the latest Call of Duty asking you to exchange cash for a Snoop Dogg skin, Roblox players “spend a lot of time spinning gambling wheels and waiting for countdowns that will change the shop, or open a mystery box or that sort of thing, which I think doesn’t register as a mechanism by which the platform is serving corporate interests,” she said. When I asked Roblox whether the company believes children are psychologically equipped to handle playing roulette, a company executive stressed that parents are ultimately responsible and noted that the element of chance is fundamental to other kids’ games. Some Roblox worlds seem to lean into the absurdity of the platform’s incessant money grabs. One game is little more than players running side by side on virtual treadmills to slowly generate points that could be used to buy in-game upgrades, allowing them to run better. Another has your character slowly climbing a ladder that stretches into the stratosphere, earning coins with each rung. Anyone wishing to bypass the monotony of running on a treadmill or climbing an infinite ladder can, of course, spend Robux. A reliable supply of Robux requires access to a bank account or credit card, something out of reach for most young gamers. This means, as the company noted in its most recent earnings report, “a small portion of our users have historically been payers.” In 2025, out of more than 110 million average daily users, only a little more than a million purchased Robux. But as any casino knows, the most important thing is to get people in the door and keep them playing, which the company all but admits: “We believe that maintaining and growing our overall number of DAUs, including the number of DAUs who may not purchase and spend Robux, is important to the success of our business,” the company has said, referring to “daily active users.” As with Facebook, Instagram, and every other platform that trades on attention, engagement is the name of the game. As time goes on, “we expect more users to become payers and for payers, on average, to increase their purchase of Robux,” the company assured investors. Fairplay takes particular issue with games “designed to be ‘unfun’ in order to drive microtransactions,” as a recent report by the organization puts it. Waiting for a tree to grow, idling on line to visit Shrek’s toilet, climbing an infinite ladder, the heretical idea of a speed-limited Sonic the Hedgehog — all instances of a game deliberately hamstrung to offer a glimpse of fun behind a gilded curtain. This is by no means a strategy invented by Roblox; free-to-play games that exploit our natural impatience date back to early-aughts hits like Neopets. The intervening years have seen game designers refine the science of doling out carefully dosed dopamine hits to hook players and pry open their wallets. But the sheer scale and popularity of Roblox makes groups like Fairplay worry kids don’t stand a chance. “They’re just developing concepts of money and economy and advertising when they get exposed to all of this,” Haley Hinkle of Fairplay told me. “And so it’s kind of beyond what we could reasonably expect them to understand.” Youth-targeted brands like Nickelodeon and Mattel have naturally jumped into Roblox, creating promotional games that function as playable advertisements. Barbie DreamHouse Tycoon, for example, lets gamers deck out their own virtual dollhouse, though nearly every home improvement requires virtual currency. The Home Depot, Chipotle, Walmart and Sam’s Club, and LensCrafters have all created bespoke Roblox worlds. In 2022, Victoria’s Secret produced a Roblox world for its Happy Nation sub-brand aimed at kids ages 8 to 13. Kids who entered the Happy Nation hub navigated obstacle courses, filling their “Happy Meter” by collecting rainbows, which would eventually result in “celebratory fireworks, a boost in speed and doubled points,” according to a company press release. In addition to a full Happy Meter, players could walk away with a virtual tote bag and, most important, an increased familiarity with the Happy Nation family of products. This year, Roblox announced a feature that lets companies sell and ship physical, real-world goods to gamers. Visitors at the Fenty Beauty Experience hop around on dazzling obstacle courses and take in the virtual scenery, but its raison d’être is the button that lets you buy $22 lip gloss. Like every great tech company before it, Roblox knows that if you can’t get most users to pay, there’s still money to be made in advertising to the freeloaders. The marketing industry’s excitement over Roblox stems from luring prospective customers into bespoke virtual worlds: advertisements you can actually inhabit and explore, rather than static billboards. But the popularity of “advergames” on Roblox has drawn some criticism, mostly from advocacy groups. The advocacy group Truth in Advertising, which in 2022 sent a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission accusing Roblox of engaging in deceptive marketing tactics with children. The following spring, Roblox told reporters it was implementing restrictions for marketing aimed at gamers under 13. Roblox’s current advertising-standards policy instructs marketers that it is their responsibility to comply with these rules, namely “hiding all advertising content from users under the age of 13.” Many prominent brands seem indifferent. Advergames like H&M Loooptopia, Fenty Beauty Experience, and Alo Sanctuary are all described as appropriate for ages 5 and up. “There is little to no evidence that Roblox is actively enforcing its current advertising policy concerning children,” said Bonnie Patten, Truth in Advertising’s executive director. “We actually have someone on staff who regularly logs on to Roblox, posing as kids under the age of 13 to see what kinds of advertising tactics she’s exposed to on the platform. Her engagement with the platform has led us to conclude that Roblox is using its ad ban as a shield.” When I asked Roblox how advertising fits into its conception of child safety, company executives emphasized that most users don’t pay to play the game and that microtransactions are optional. If Chipotle wants a virtual Burrito Builder, it pays a third-party developer to build it, not Roblox itself. To compensate, the company has in recent years reshaped its display-advertising system into something more akin to what’s offered through Instagram and Google Ads, in which ads appear where the user interfaces with the platform. Ironically, what the company describes as “immersive” in-world ads closely resemble the pre-internet, pre-computer formats that have been around for centuries: virtual posters on virtual bus shelters in virtual cities, virtual billboards towering over virtual streets. A video demonstration on Roblox’s site shows avatars huddled before a sign reading EARN FREE ITEM BY WATHCING 15 SECOND AD — an ad for an ad! — and doing exactly that; after the Hugo Boss spot finishes, a beanie materializes on one player’s head, leading him and his friends to dance in a circle. ADD VALUE, the company exhorts. NOT INTERRUPTION. That seeing a sign telling you to look at another sign in exchange for a hat could be considered anything but the definition of an interruption speaks to a seismic shift in what consumers consider intolerable. In Roblox, advertisers have access to not just a gazillion eyeballs but a population for whom corporations are just another parasocial relationship. These young consumers can barely distinguish advertising from anything else. “When we ask them, ‘Have you ever seen advertising in Roblox?,’ the young people in our focus groups were like, ‘Well, no, I’ve seen it on other games where there’s a pop-up ad for something. But in Roblox they don’t really do advertising,’” said Franz. “And then they said things like, ‘Well, you know, we’ve seen Chanel bags in the Roblox shop, but I don’t think that’s Chanel advertising.’ We know that stealth advertising works really well on young people because they can’t register it as advertising.” Indeed, Roblox says a brand’s mere presence “does not always qualify it as an advertisement” and that the onus is on the brand to decide whether its content is an ad. A 13-year-old Roblox player I spoke to, who began playing at age 7, described being desensitized to branded content over the years. “It’s kind of been normalized since I’ve played it for a long time,” he told me. “And I feel like it’s been normalized to a lot of other people too.” A 10-year-old Robloxer put things more plainly. What is Roblox to her? “It’s just hanging out.” And is the presence of brands while hanging out normal? “Well, to me it is.” Developers can also glean data about how exactly gamers are behaving. “Let’s say I was making a pizza-making game,” explained Heather Healy of Super League, a metaverse advertising agency. “I’d be able to track how many pizzas were made every day, what ingredients were most used.” Clever work-arounds by developers can help fill in gaps in data that Roblox doesn’t yet provide. Charles Weichselbaum, a VP at the public-relations firm Golin who previously helped launch Chipotle’s Roblox burrito-wrapping simulator, recalled adding virtual characters to branded worlds that existed solely to ask players personal questions like “Hey, what’s your gender?” In this frenetic atmosphere of buying and selling, Roblox is keen to hype the successes of young developers. In a 2024 interview, Roblox executive Stefano Corazza described the opportunity for children to earn on the platform as a “gift,” particularly for those in the global South. But people like Rush Bogin are an exception. In 2021, the YouTube channel People Make Games published a video investigation titled “How Roblox Is Exploiting Young Game Developers,” detailing how the company entices children ages 13 and up into monetizing their work on Roblox. One of the channel’s hosts, gaming journalist Quintin Smith, pointed out that Roblox boasts that its top developers earn millions of dollars — “And so can you!” — while in reality, most will earn little to nothing. Even if a game should become successful, how much money a lucky developer walks away with is not a simple matter. While PC-game storefronts like Steam take a simple 30 percent cut, Roblox’s take varies based on a byzantine variety of factors and differs based on what exactly is being sold. In some cases, a developer receives only 25 percent of money spent within a game on things like chance wheels and loot boxes. The split is so convoluted that a company page trying to explain it includes a pie chart, a flow chart, and caveats like “Note that the chart doesn’t reflect our expenses as disclosed in our GAAP financial statements.” Also, all sales are tabulated not in real currency but in Robux — and can’t be withdrawn and converted into cash until you’ve hit a 30,000 Robux threshold. The inconsistent conversion-rate problem comes back to the fore here. Even if one reaches the point where the company will send real money, it does so on extremely disadvantageous terms: At current rates, spending $200 will get you 24,000 Robux. But converting 24,000 Robux a kid has earned diligently building and selling a game nets them only $91. The whole dynamic — encouraging children as young as 13 to do computer work, taking most of their earnings, and paying the rest in scrip — “would be illegal if it weren’t happening online,” Smith argued. At last year’s Roblox Developers Conference, Baszucki presented a slide of five-year predictions for the company with dreamy ideas like a “universal civility metric” that “for most players, increases over time.” Baszucki imagined Roblox as a Fortune 500 hiring tool, a virtual meeting space, a medium for families to stay in touch, a school that creates a “full K-12 curriculum with Roblox.” And, perhaps auguring disastrous headlines to come, Roblox dating (for adults only). The future of Roblox, according to Baszucki, is to bring the world together — but to do what, exactly? Shop? Yes. Learn of the latest tasty entrées at Chipotle while dressed as Sonic the Hedgehog in a bulletproof vest? Absolutely. Roblox seems to be not just rebuilding the shopping-mall experience but expanding it into a self-contained paradise of software consumerism that could truly eat the world. Not content with shopping and gaming, Baszucki wants Roblox to be the place where you will live your life. In more ways than one, the children really might be our future. It may be wise, at this point, to bear in mind how poorly the video-game anxieties of yesterday have aged. There was a time when Doom and Grand Theft Auto were suspected of turning kids into murderers; the idea that violent games automatically created violent children isn’t just embarrassing in hindsight but largely debunked by decades of research and social science. I was also struck, no matter how horrified I was by Roblox’s cosmetics-pushing obstacle courses and casino pleasure gardens, by one thought: God, I would have loved this when I was 12. The platform may seem baffling to adults, but its charm is obvious. What could possibly be more enticing to any kid than a free game where all of your friends already congregate, that looks and sounds absolutely deranged and will alienate your clueless parents and teachers? At the same time, the megapopular internet platform of my generation turned my peers and even our parents into screen junkies who spend their waking hours scrolling an infinite feed of slop and marketing that gets crappier and less useful by the day. What’s worrisome about Roblox is that the appeal of its universe — where slop and commerce and dopamine rushes are seamlessly blended — is that it’s intuitive. It’s the logical end point of the internet’s enshittification playing out before a younger generation’s eyes. The total victory of Roblox’s vision may lie not in its ability to dominate us but in its ability to subsume “real life” to the point that we don’t even know it’s there. If this sounds unpleasant to you, you may soon find yourself a minority. Where older generations fretted about “selling out or giving in to the man,” Healy said, “the younger generation just doesn’t care.” Healy described publishing influencer videos to demographically distant internet platforms. “You could see the exact same video posted on Facebook with a lot of negative responses.” But put that clip on TikTok, Healy says, “that same piece of video content, you look at the comments and you see Gen Z and Gen Alpha saying, ‘Oh, go get that bag!’” Roblox’s marketing allies share the company’s totalizing vision. Brent Koning of Dentsu, a marketing agency that works with Roblox, described the company as a kind of digital arcology where living, talking, shopping, and streaming are merged into one digital omni-existence. “That aspirational side is something that I long for and we talk to them about all the time,” he told me. Imagine, said Konig, being able to watch anything you want from inside Roblox. Your favorite Netflix show, maybe. While you’re waiting, you fire up Spotify to listen to your favorite music. Then you fire up Shopify in search of new sneakers. “I don’t know what they look like on me, so I go to Nike Land, and I can try them on real quick.” At no point have you closed Roblox, or looked away from your screen, or necessarily moved an inch. Inside this mall, there is no time, no space, no entertainment, no socialization. These are labels of the old world, as relevant as Macy’s. Roblox is the super-experience, the final app. Go get that bag. By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

Title: Massive AI salaries and RTO are fueling a real estate boom in San Francisco: 'It's going to rain money'
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-money-rto-real-estate-boom-san-francisco-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-09T09:00:01Z
Full Content:
The AI boom has lit a fuse under San Francisco's housing market, with prices and rents inflamed by a tech workforce increasingly returning to the office, and as the AI talent wars push salaries to dizzying highs. Tech workers are flocking to the Bay Area to work at OpenAI, Anthropic, and Nvidia after the region was dealt a massive blow during the COVID-19 pandemic. Real estate agents say RTO is fueling the resurgence, with AI being particularly synonymous with in-person work and hardcore culture. What's more, tech workers, especially those working in AI, are commanding massive salaries, including multimillion-dollar compensation packages. The salary needed to afford a home in the San Jose metro area — which encompasses Silicon Valley and the headquarters for Meta, Google, and Nvidia — crossed the $400,000 threshold for the first time in April 2024, said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist — "an inconceivable amount of money unless you work in AI, and those salaries are probably more common." This makes it the most expensive metro area in the US. Home prices in the San Jose metro area are up 3% year-over-year, according to Redfin. While big AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic aren't public, employees can tap equity during stock sales on the private market. One former OpenAI employee, who requested anonymity to speak about personal matters, told Business Insider they purchased a home in San Francisco during the company's last tender and knew of at least four others who did the same. "It's definitely the popular move, and people are talking about it again," they said. The luxury housing market in San Francisco is also setting records. More homes sold above $20 million in the city last year than ever before, according to Sotheby's 2025 Mid-Year Luxury Outlook report, which its international realty chief marketing officer, A. Bradley Nelson, attributed largely to AI's rise. Another Bay Area county, San Mateo County, nestled between San Francisco and Silicon Valley, is seeing record prices for single-family homes — $2.6 million on average this year, according to MLS data. This boom is fueled by both the rise of AI and the strength of the stock market, said Raziel Ungar, a San Mateo County real estate agent who has worked with Big Tech buyers working at Oracle, Google, and Apple. "There's been so much wealth that's been created in the last few years, in particular in the Valley, that it's pushed our prices higher," Ungar said. San Francisco real estate agent Ruth Krishnan has worked with several OpenAI employees who have cashed out during tender offers to make down payments on homes, she said. Krishnan likened the current "level of frenzy" to the period before Facebook's IPO in 2012, with homebuying anticipation fueling rapid transactions and swaths of competitive offers on each property. With news of OpenAI's latest $10.3 billion secondary share sale, "it's going to rain money in SF," she said. AI workers are quickly adapting to newfound wealth. A second former OpenAI employee said that when they first moved to San Francisco, they lived in a group house and paid roughly $1,200 a month in rent. Now, former colleagues frequent Michelin-starred restaurants and wear luxury goods. "They have massive bag collections, they have upgraded their houses, and everything," the second former employee said. "It feels more like a normal tech company or even kind of like finance in some ways." The rental market is also rocketing. Rents across the San Francisco metro area are up about 5% since last year — double the pace of national growth, a Zillow representative told Business Insider. Apartment hunters are handing out "tenant résumés" at packed showings, making offers site unseen, offering several months of rent in advance, or coming in at thousands of dollars over the asking price, The San Francisco Standard previously reported. In terms of specific San Francisco neighborhoods, Mission Bay is central to AI activity, Krishnan said, while the Hayes Valley neighborhood has been dubbed "Cerebral Valley." Other desirable neighborhoods for those in the field include South Beach, Dogpatch, Potrero Hill, the Mission, Noe Valley, and Bernal Heights, Krishnan said. Despite their eye-popping salaries, the average AI homebuyer tends to be more pragmatic, real estate agents said. They're "data-driven and decisive," said San Francisco real estate agent Danielle Lazier, adding that many clients "model payments, taxes, and micro-market evaluations with large language models before touring." While the single-family home market is "on fire" and condos are "perking up," Lazier said a full pre-COVID recovery hasn't yet been attained. Krishnan agreed that buyers in AI aren't "going crazy," adding that a typical purchase ranges from $2 million to $4 million — still a relatively staggering sum. The AI wave is nascent, and while many of her clients are young, they're aware of past tech busts, she said. "They're being very cautious about what if this doesn't last forever," she said. "They've heard of people who thought that they had all this money that then disappeared, and it seems to be top of mind for them, actually. So they're not overspending. They're cautiously spending."

Title: Apple to unveil next iPhone amid Trump trade war that could result in higher prices

Apple on Tuesday will unveil its next line-up of iPhones amid a global trade war that’s added a potential price increase to the usual intrigue surrounding the annual evolution of the company’s marquee product Apple has unveiled its new iPhones 17 lineup, along with updates to its digital watches and AirPod products at its annual September product launch. The new iPhones are the first to be released since President Donald Trump returned to the White House and unleashed a barrage of tariffs, in what his administration says is an attempt to bring overseas manufacturing back to the U.S. — a crusade that has thrust Apple CEO Tim Cook into the hot seat. The new devices come with a larger, 6.3-inch display and is powered by a new a A19 chip to help power Apple's AI features. The iPhone 17’s front camera has also been upgraded to have a wider field of view and new sensor, allowing you to take landscape photos without having to rotate your phone The new devices are still expected to be made in Apple's manufacturing hubs in China and India, much to the Trump administration's consternation. Both Trump and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have repeatedly insisted that iPhones be made in the U.S. instead of overseas. It's an unrealistic demand that analysts say would take years to pull off and would result in a doubling, or even a tripling, of the iPhone's current average price of about $1,000. Cook tried to placate Trump by initially pledging that Apple would invest $500 billion i n the U.S. over the next four years, and then upped the ante last month by adding another $100 billion to the commitment. He also gifted Trump a statue featuring a 24-karat gold base. That kind of diplomacy has helped insulate Apple from Trump's most severe tariffs. However, the iPhones being brought into the U.S. still face duties of about 25%, stoking speculation that the company will reveal its first across-the-board price increase in five years in an effort to preserve its hefty profit margins. Since 2020, Apple has charged $800 for its basic iPhone and $1,200 for its top offering, but analysts now believe the company may raise prices by $50 to $100 on some of the new models. If Apple does announce price increases, it will come just weeks after Google held steady on prices for its new Pixel smartphones. Although Apple's stock price is still down by 4% so far this year, the shares have been bouncing back in recent months amid signs it won't be as hard hit by the tariffs as once feared, and a highly anticipated court ruling cleared the way for the company to continue receiving $20 billion annually to lock in Google's search engine as the default option on iPhones. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Apple is set to reveal its latest iPhones amidst trade war tensions, potentially leading to price increases. Despite pressure from the Trump administration to manufacture in the U.S., production remains largely in China and India. While minor upgrades are expected, including camera and battery improvements, analysts question Apple's innovation in the AI era, impacting its stock performance.

Title: I've used the Dreame U20 for months and it still surprises me how well this affordable cordless vacuum cleans pet hair

Time Published: 2025-09-09T05:20:34Z

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. If you're after a budget vacuum that's capable of handling messes – especially pet-made ones – the U20 is one to consider. Even without industry-leading suction, it cleans hard floors well and is extremely maneuverable. Moreover, its classy color scheme makes it look more premium than it costs. The lack of a display to gauge battery life is my only gripe but, again, it's hard to fault at the U20's affordable price point. Great value for money Good suction for hair and fur Lightweight & easy to maneuvre Useful attachments, including a wall mount Headlight on cleaning head is a nice touch No LCD display Average battery life Small dustbin Longer recharging time Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test. Hailing from parent company, Xiaomi, Dreame is fast becoming a popular sub-brand with an extensive product lineup. Ranging from wet-dry vacuums, air purifiers, robot vacuums (including a robot lawnmower), cordless stick vacuums and hair dryers, Dreame has it all, and across different budgets, too. While its high-end robovacs are items to dream about (pun intended), as you can see in our Dreame X50 Ultra review, I’m in love with a much cheaper product that helps me clean up after my pets. The affordable Dreame U20 has become my lifesaver, combining Dyson-like tech with the signature Dreame style. It’s a versatile and lightweight cordless vacuum that delivers great performance for an exceptionally low cost, as it’s very frequently discounted. Its color scheme belies its budget price point – available in a gorgeous gold and beige colourway, the Dreame U20 looks far more premium than its $249.99 / £250 / AU$399.99 price point suggests. What I found even more impressive is its suction. For the price, its 120AW power isn’t bad at all, which isn’t too far off the Shark Cordless Detect Pro’s 123AW of suction, and yet it was more than enough to clean my pup’s fur off my sofa and carpets well. Needless to say, it handles hard floors very easily, making it a candidate for being one of the best cordless vacuum cleaners. It comes with the standard attachments, including a multi-surface brush head with LED blue lights to illuminate dark areas, a mini motorized brush for cleaning upholstery, a crevice tool and a removable battery that's rated for up to 60 minutes. Realistically, though, you'll get no more 37-40 minutes when using the two motorized attachments on the lowest suction, but that's fine for smaller homes – I can easily vacuum my living area, two bedrooms and two bathrooms within that time. However, if you mostly have carpets, I found it can take longer to get it clean as you may need to go back and forth a few times, thus consuming more battery. The only battery indicator on the U20 is a tiny light on the end cap, which is hard to see while in use, and it blinks when it’s running low. There’s also no quick charging here, and the vacuum can take up to 3.5 hours to fully recharge. The only other downside to this otherwise great buy is that the dustbin capacity is only 0.5L, meaning you might need to empty it frequently if you have a large home with pets. If you don't need any more bells and whistles, the Dreame U20 is easy to recommend as a top-notch budget cordless vacuum cleaner. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The Dreame U20 can be picked up in the US at Target for a list price of $249.99. It’s also available on Instacart, with supplies stocked at Costco and other smaller retailers. It is currently not available on Dreame's US store. In the UK, the list price is £250, and you can pick it up from Amazon UK or Curry's, but again, the vacuum is currently unavailable at the brand's UK store. For customers living in Australia, Amazon AU lists it for AU$399.99, but it's typically discounted to AU$199.99. Even in Australia, the U20 isn't available on the Dreame website. The Dreame website lists 27 countries where its devices are available, including the U20. If you're having trouble finding the product, check their website to see if it's available where you live. Even at full price, the Dreame U20 represents superb value for money, particularly if you can find it at a discounted price. Admittedly it's a very basic model, so if you want a touch more suction, Dreame has other mid-range models, with the Dreame R20 review scoring very well for balancing price and performance. Type: Cordless stick vacuum Bagless: Yes Weight: 7.27 lbs / 3.3kg Bin size: 0.5 liters / 500ml Max runtime: 60 mins Charge time: 3.5 hours Tools: Multi-surface brush head, motorized mini brush head, wide combination crevice tool and extension rod Power: 120AW I’m new to the world of vacuum testing, with just one other for sister site Tom’s Guide under my belt. Needless to say, the Dreame U20 has been quite the dream, especially when it came to design. For me, the gold and beige colorway was a winner, a stray away from the typical grey or black of other competitors. It lends the affordable vacuum a classy look. Other than that, the Dreame U20 has a stock-standard design which allows it to become a handheld unit quickly for cleaning cars, sofas, mattresses and, hey, even dog beds. To pair with the handheld unit, there’s a motorized mini brush in the box that would be handy for said dog bed and the sofa. It could even be used on carpeted stairs. It has a trigger, like most Dyson models, but you don’t need to keep this pressed at all times to run the machine – you just need to click it on and off. There’s just one other control button on the motor’s end cap to change suction modes and that should be easy to reach for most users with the thumb when holding the U20. The main floor-cleaning attachment is called the Multi-Surface Brush, which features LED blue lights that help illuminate the floor in front of the brush head but don’t highlight miniscule dust particles like Dyson’s Fluffy tool does. And that’s OK because it still helps you see in dark areas – for example, I was able to see scattered kitty litter in an unlit bathroom. The other attachment in the box is a combination crevice tool, but a wall-mount kit also ships with the vacuum in case you want to stow it away in a convenient place without compromising floor space. Weighing 3.3kg / 7.27lbs, the Dreame U20 isn't exactly lightweight (in comparison, the Shark Cordless Detect Pro weighs 2.7kg / 5.9lbs), but it's still very easy to push around. It measures 16cm x 30cm x 68cm with the extension rod attached. The 120AW motor is capable of running at three different speed modes, indicated by three lights on the end cap of the motor. You can switch between the speed settings (low, medium and high) by tapping the button directly below the lights and switching it on by using the trigger. For most cleans, I found I tended to flick between medium and high, especially when cleaning carpets. According to Dreame, the U20 motor has a multi-layer filtration system that captures up to 99.9% of fine dust and particles. Its HEPA filter also keeps debris out of the air and inside the bin while vacuuming, which is pretty standard for any cordless vacuum cleaner these days. For its price point, the 0.5L bin is quite standard, but it'll likely fill up fast if you have, say, a two-bedroom or larger home with pets, meaning you'll need to make more trips to empty it. The bin has a handy sticker on the front (which I did refer back to many times) that indicates how to insert or remove it to empty, and its as simple as pushing the button on the base and twisting the canister clockwise. After detaching, all you have to do is unscrew the filter from the container to remove the debris – finer dust or crumbs fall out easily, but you may need to get your fingers inside to remove clumps of hair from the bin. The detachable battery pack could be handy for some users as you can clip it into the wall-mount attachment and begin charging it while you’re emptying the vacuum for example. However, if you’re a renter who can't drill holes into your wall – like me – you can leave the battery attached to the U20 and keep the vacuum propped up against a wall or in a cupboard for topping up. It lacks an LCD screen to show suction modes or time remaining before the next charge. Instead, the battery life is displayed by a small vertical light on the pack itself, which flashes when it needs charging. It's unfortunate that it faces forward, so it’s not visible to the user, and neither is it a very noticeable light – and this is my biggest complaint with the Dreame U20 as there were a few instances where the machine shut down mid-clean during my testing. The U20’s multi-surface brush head is quite similar to many floor-cleaning attachments from other brands, but it features blue LED lights on the front that illuminate two small triangular sections of the floor immediately in front of the brush head. While it looks similar to Dyson’s green dust-illuminating light on the Fluffy Optic, this blue light doesn’t highlight invisible dust on the floor, but I found it’s bright and vivid enough to help walk around in a dark room without bumping into things. Case in point: it perfectly showed scattered kitty litter in an unlit bathroom that was, at the time, pitch dark. The brush also has V-shaped bristles with comb-like teeth – in my experience, this not only prevents tangles effectively, but can pick up human hair and pet fur from low-pile carpets just as well. This brush head is quite flexible, rotating 90º around chair legs and furniture. It’s also not as large as you’d find on other (more expensive) vacuum cleaners and I found it can get into corners, which is particularly helpful in my pet hair-filled home. My favorite attachment, however, is the motorized mini brush, which clips in just under the bin for handheld use. It’s just right for sucking up fur from my couch and cushions – it’s both maneuvrable and anti-tangle. If it wasn’t for the missing display to check battery life, I’d say that Dreame would deserve top marks for the U20’s design. I've spent a few months with the Dreame U20 (as of publishing this review) and I still can’t get over how impressive its maneuverability is. The 90º rotating main brush head makes it very easy to clean around chair legs and furniture and I had no trouble handling the 3.3kg / 7.2lbs vacuum. That said, if you are using the extension tube to clean ceiling corners, the U20 could begin to feel heavy for some users quickly. The controls are well placed, which are as simple as pushing the end cap button to select the speed and hitting the trigger underneath. And as I’ve mentioned previously, there’s no need to keep the latter depressed continuously for power like a Dyson. Speaking of power: sure, we could ask for higher suction than its 120AW, but given its price point, it’s hard to argue with what it has. If you do need better performance, you could consider the Dreame R20 (if it’s available where you live), but I found the U20 does an admirable job nonetheless. It can struggle on some carpets as you will need to go over a particular spot multiple times to get a deeper clean, and I've found myself needing to push with full shoulder force on occasion. Throughout my testing, the Dreame U20 impressed in more ways than one. I performed TechRadar’s standard tests for vacuum cleaners, sprinkling a smattering of oats and tea from a bag on both my hardwood and carpeted floors. As an extra measure, I also made sure the floors had extra pet debris – i.e. kitty litter and fur – which were my two motivations for purchasing the U20 in the first place. During the hardwood mess test, the U20 performed remarkably well on the lowest speed setting in picking up most of the oats. I needed to boost the speed to the second (or medium) setting to do another pass to pick up every last speck of oats, though, but that left the hard floor entirely clean. As for the tea, the U20 did a better job, sucking it all up in one go on the low setting, so it handles lighter and smaller dirt better than larger debris. It was the same for pet hair on hardwood – all strands got sucked up in one pass on the low setting. The vacuum struggled a touch with kitty litter, leaving a few specks behind on hard floors in a single pass, but it was cleaned up in the second go. I wasn’t expecting as impressive a performance on carpets, but the U20 did better than I had anticipated on a low-pile carpet in my tests, quickly removing the oats and tea dust from a bag in one pass on the low suction setting. It will, however, struggle with medium and high-pile carpets, particularly if the dust and debris is deep-seated, although loose dirt will come away if you give the area a few gos with the U20. In terms of pet hair on carpet, the U20 did indeed struggle at the lowest setting, leaving more than a few strands behind after the first pass. The U20 performed the best with pet hair on the same low-pile carpet at maximum suction, and didn't require several passes to get the job done. The kitty litter yielded a similar result to the hardwood floor test, but I needed to boost suction again to pick up every last piece. While it can tackle low-pile carpets with ease, pet hair embedded in medium- or high-pile carpets will remain even after several passes – you can expect about 80% off the fur to be sucked up from these kinds of flooring. As a pet mum, it was important to me to own a vacuum cleaner with a tangle-free brush, as I’ve often painstakingly cleaned out wads of hair from cleaning attachments of older machines. I was thrilled to find that the U20's V-shaped bristles were especially impressive at leaving no evidence of entanglements. That's made ongoing maintenance of the vacuum easier. This sentiment also rang true for the mini motor brush when cleaning my couch and cushions. It does, however, require several passes when using the handheld motor and mini brush to clean up pet hair due to its smaller footprint, but it still worked a treat. The U20 collects a nice volume of hair in its 0.5L bin, and I have particularly enjoyed how easy it is to empty the bin with a twist of the base. If you are a pet owner with a shedding furry friend, then I would recommend the U20 for a quick, daily tidy-up, but you might want to consider other pet-focused vacuum cleaners, like the Shark Stratos Pet Pro (IZ400), as they usually have a larger-capacity bin and boast more suction power. Despite its relatively lower suction and smaller bin, the U20 performs very well, given its budget price – it's very easy to recommend for quick clean-ups. According to Dreame, the U20 has a battery life of up to 60 minutes on a full charge, and takes around 3.5 hours to top up from practically empty. Take that number with a pinch of salt, as it indicates runtime when using non-motorized tools, which in this case is the combination crevice attachment only. With a motorized head like the main floor cleaner and the mini brush, I found that it lasts a maximum of 37 minutes on its lowest setting – and there’s no dynamic suction here to drain the battery faster. At TechRadar, we've tested over a hundred vacuum cleaners over the last decade, and we've found that the average battery life for a budget cordless vacuum is around 40 minutes, which puts the U20 on par with others, including the Dyson V8 . Higher the suction, the faster the battery will drain, of course and, in testing, I got about 17 minutes of runtime on a full charge when set to maximum. That’s not bad, considering some premium models like the Dyson V15 Detect can give you lesser runtime on Boost mode (about 8 minutes on a dirty mid-pile carpet), although it automatically adjusts suction power to suit the amount of dirt it detects. So while the U20 has average battery runtime, I’d recommend it for smaller homes or something for the shed, perhaps. Attribute Notes Rating Value Often on sale, the U20 is an excellent budget option with great performance. 5/5 Design The color combination makes it look premium, and its attachments are useful. It would have been good if there was a better way to gauge battery life. 4/5 Performance Great for everyday, quick cleaning, even of pet hair, on hard floors and low-pile carpets, but it may struggle on particularly dirty mid- and high-pile carpets. 4.5/5 Battery Rated for up to 60 minutes, but expect about 35 minutes in real-world use on low power. 4/5 You need something to quickly clean up after your pet The U20 handled masses of pet hair quite well, thanks to its V-shaped multi-surface brush head. You want something easy to maneuver It might be heavier than the likes of the Shark Cordless Detect Pro (which weighs around 2.7kg / 5.9lbs), but its swivelling main brush head makes it very easy to move around, particularly on hard floors. You live in a large home With average battery life for its price point, the U20 is better suited for smaller areas or homes that don't require extensive vacuuming. You want the latest vacuuming tech The U20 doesn't house the most advanced features, it even misses out on an LED screen to display battery life. If you don’t want something this basic, you’ll need to look elsewhere and spend more money. Product: Dreame U20 (reviewed) Shark Cordless Detect Pro Dyson V8 Weight: 7.27lbs / 3.3kg 6lbs / 2.7kg 3.48lbs / 1.58kg Bin volume: 0.5L 0.4L 0.54L Max runtime: 60 mins 40 mins 40 mins Accessories: Multi-surface brush head, motorized mini brush head, wide combination crevice tool and extension rod Duster, crevice tool, optional auto-empty dock (costs extra) 2 x floorheads, Hair screw tool, Combination tool, Crevice tool Shark Cordless Detect Pro The Shark Cordless Detect Pro costs a lot more than the U20, but it has better suction and, you can opt for the additional auto-emptying dock, which is handy as the onboard bin canister here is very small. However, it's often discounted and, until it was displaced by the Shark PowerDetect, it used to be our pick of the best cordless vacuum for most people. Read our full Shark Cordless Detect Pro review Dyson V8 Despite receiving a newer upgrade in September 2025, the older Dyson V8 is still a strong choice, especially since this too can be had for a good discount. It boast good performance and suction, with up to 40 minutes of runtime on its standard setting. It's extremely lightweight at 1.58kg / 3.48lbs, but it lacks some of the useful features of newer Dyson models, and it might not always represent the best value for everyone. Read our full Dyson V8 review TechRadar adopts a strict testing regime for all its products so potential buyers know exactly what they're getting. To comply with the testing, I used the machine for a few months before putting it through some rigorous carpet and hard-floor tests using common pantry items, such as tea and raw oats. I also took into account the device's ergonomics, design and overall experience to determine my final verdict.

Title: Why Can’t Oracle Afford Data Centers?

Time Published: 2025-09-09T02:36:48Z

Read By Tl;dr – Oracle remains the x-axis of AI/cloud computing (but their revenue forecasts are geometric) Update: Oracle reported earnings yesterday, missing on both revenue and profit expectations and reporting slower growth than the much larger Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft. Free cash flow dropped deeper into the red. Oracle’s CAPEX spend dropped from $9.2 billion to $8.5 billion. But they announced they have signed contracts for nearly geometric increases in cloud revenue over the next five years, going from $10.3 billion in the last fiscal year (FY25) to $144 billion in FY30. The stock is up insanely as a result. The discussion of the CAPEX required to realize these revenue forecasts was minimal. Oracle guided to $35 billion in CAPEX for FY26 and threw around some words about how they’re “asset pretty light”. Oracle’s belief in magic beans abides. But no infrastructure, no revenue remains an iron law of the cloud world. Oracle still needs to come up with a lot of capital for CAPEX, amidst other demands for capital (dividends, buybacks to raise Larry’s stake, servicing debt). Oracle’s future is tied to Open AI. The vast majority of the forecasted revenue would come from Open AI. It isn’t clear how Open AI will find hundreds of billions to pay for infrastructure and all their other ambitions. The other customers referenced are neither big nor reliable revenue. xAI has no revenue, no prospects for real revenue, and is already turning to debt funding (plus borrowing from SpaceX). Meta has no business plan to pay for their ($600 billion and counting!) AI mulligan, but likely promised some very expensive employees they’d have GPUs to play with. NVIDIA and AMD paying Oracle for infrastructure is simply revenue recycling. Oracle still has to come up with the cash to play this game. They’re promised the revenue. Now they need to show us the CAPEX to realize that revenue. Update 2: WSJ confirms the vast majority of Oracle’s promised future revenue ($300 billion) would come from Open AI. Oracle stock is now a one-way bet on Open AI’s ability to raise hundreds of billions in more capital. Update 3: I just went ahead and wrote another post about Remaining CAPEX Obligation. Absolute bestest most glorious company ever in entire universe of all time prepare awesome-sauce victory lap. With tomorrow’s earnings announcement the database vampire will permit us to bask in their greatness and invite us to contemplate why other companies even exist. Things are always so fabulous that the Oxford English Dictionary is considering replacing the word “superlative” with “Oracle”. Beyond bombastically scripted earnings calls, deploying CAPEX effectively and efficiently at scale takes place in a cold, hard reality. We’ve been chronicling Oracle’s difficulties building data centers at bonsai scale, never mind at hyperscale: Oracle (company slogan: “that’s not just a rack, it’s an entire region!”) has slowly increased its CAPEX spend, but at a pace that falls further and further behind the hyperCAPEX companies. Oracle’s first decent-sized data center, the oft-touted yet somehow still under construction project in Abilene, is well on its way to becoming the picture accompanying the dictionary definition of “construction site”. Partly it earns that status because it has taken so long, but also because that data center has so many mouths to feed (Blue Owl, Primary Digital Infrastructure, Lancium, Crusoe, Oracle, and Open AI are all laying claim to those construction photos). Oracle’s primary contribution seems to consist of yelling at the contractors. Oracle is “all-in” on their data center plans, and has expended enormous energy to get themselves referred to as a “hyperscaler”. But are they really in the hyperscaler club? Let’s see how Oracle stacks up with actual hyperscalers. This is a high-stakes financial game requiring gargantuan resources and a broad array of competencies. When it comes to the metrics, Oracle always seems to play the role of the x-axis (a joke I never tire of and Oracle never manages to break away from that gravitational pull). Let’s look at some proxies for financial prowess: Oracle is the revenue runt of their aspirational litter. By a lot. Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business is the runt, except for Meta who don’t have a cloud business. (One of the great mysteries of the universe is where Meta sees the return coming from its rapidly escalating infrastructure investment promises — $600 billion and counting!. Unlike our other contestants, they have no cloud services business and a checkered history serving developers. As with Elon, taking a dependency on Meta is high risk. Maybe Meta alone has glimpsed some new zero-to-one geyser of revenue that will pay for all those data centers? Regardless, and reluctantly returning to today’s topic at hand, Meta still has vastly more cash to play this game than Oracle). Three-for-three on runt status. Oracle does show leadership on one metric: the debt to equity ratio. They’re already carrying a much bigger debt load than their desired peer group, while also the company that could most use some credit. For free cash flow (cash flow minus CAPEX), Oracle is yet still again the runt. Oracle’s competitors are both spending much more on CAPEX and still have significant, positive free cash flow. And when we look at the most recent quarter, Oracle’s free cash flow went negative (-$394 million) as they ramped their CAPEX spend to (merely) $9 billion in the quarter. Now let’s look at CAPEX spending, that ultimate separator of clouds and clowns. Emphatically runty. Oracle is already more stressed with their (modest) CAPEX spend relative to revenue. Cumulative CAPEX spending gives us a sense of how much infrastructure a company has deployed. Amazon, AWS, Google, Meta and Microsoft all spent more on CAPEX in the last year than Oracle has in the last decade, and all but Meta spent more last year on CAPEX than Oracle has in its entire fifty year existence. All of which is to say Oracle is both way behind in deployed infrastructure and playing with the smallest stack of chips in this game. Which brings me (at long last!) to my point: Oracle has hyped big revenue growth forecasts for the next couple years. In particular, they tout a deal with Open AI to bring in as much as $30 billion in incremental revenue by FY28 (we’ll ignore the question of why Microsoft decided it didn’t want this business and discarded it to Oracle). If you’re excited about the revenue opportunity in front of Oracle, you also have to grapple with the costs of the infrastructure necessary to deliver that revenue. No infrastructure, no revenue. No CAPEX, no infrastructure. So where does the money for data center CAPEX come from and what are the implications for Oracle’s free cash flow, debt load and/or margins? They need to step up from their current (modest) levels of spending which are already stressing the company’s financials. It is pretty clear Oracle is not very efficient in its CAPEX spend. They’ve been publicly demonstrating they are early on the learning curve, struggling to forecast CAPEX spending a quarter out, much less years out. They’re also in a big hurry, and there is a YOLO infrastructure cost premium. Some hardware is scarce (GPUs, gas turbines). Costs and wait times for both interconnection and hardware delivery have widened, while the hyperCAPEX companies are both bigger buyers and got in the queues earlier. End-to-end, Oracle lacks a manufacturing machine that turns dollars into data centers efficiently and effectively at scale. Over the last three years, Oracle has spent between $1 and $2 of CAPEX per dollar of cloud infrastructure revenue. AWS CAPEX historically has been between 25 to 60% of revenue (and is ramping back up as they deploy AI infrastructure). We could also model CAPEX spend based on the incremental revenue it drives (new capacity allows new revenue), which makes that $30 billion revenue dream even more expensive (and remember those GPUs are short-lived, especially if you’re chasing the pre-training market). It looks like Oracle is going to lean more on OPM (Other People’s Money or perhaps Oracle Pleads for Money) for its CAPEX spending. The data center build team was hit in the recent Oracle layoffs. The Abilene data center is already a layer cake of financial participants. Stargate was briefly the OPM salvation, but it has “struggled to get out of the gate”. Open AI finds itself doing party rounds for both cash and electricity, raising billions of dollars instead of trillions, and scavenging for megawatts rather than gigawatts. Maybe those notoriously charitable financial actors will accept lower returns just to partner with notoriously charitable Oracle? Going the OPM route negatively impacts Oracle margins, architectural control, and time-to-market. How do Oracle’s hyperscaler hopes and dreams get bankrolled?

In a new annual company letter, CEO Evan Spiegel just announced the company is restructuring around small “startup squads” of 10 to 15 people to better compete against larger competitors. The move comes as the 5,000-person company faces mounting pressure. Advertising revenue growth flatlined at 4% in the second quarter, and North American daily active users declined 2% to 98 million, a troubling sign in Snap’s most important market. Spiegel does highlight one bright spot: Snapchat+ subscriptions now generate over $700 million in annual recurring revenue from more than 15 million paying subscribers, making direct revenue “one of Snap’s fastest-growing opportunities.” Snap is also doubling down on Specs, building its own AR glasses that Spiegel envisions will replace smartphones entirely. He calls them a “a once-in-a-generation transformation towards human-centered computing.” (Meta and Google see the same future, partnering with Ray-Ban and Warby Parker, respectively.) Spiegel acknowledges the current stock price “reflects doubt” but writes that there’s “startup-style return potential” at Snap’s roughly $12 billion valuation. Left unsaid: that number is down 90% from September 2021, when Snap’s market cap topped $116 billion during the height of social media mania.

Title: Thinking more broadly: Bonds beyond vanilla

Traditionally, the job description for a core bond manager was numbing: (1) show up for work, (2) buy a bunch of Treasury bonds and some investment grade intermediate corporates, (3) celebrate the trading coup that allowed you to buy the same bond as everyone else but for a quarter basis point less – woohoo!, (4) go home and enjoy a fiber-rich dinner and small glass of red wine. In reality, managers added negligible value. Over 10 years (through August 2025), the core bond fund trailing 75% of its peers returned 1.7% annually, the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (a proxy for “the market”) returned 1.8% annually, and a fund leading 75% of its peers returned 2.2%. Net difference between cellar and penthouse: 0.5% per year. (Source: MFOPremium calculations, Lipper Global Datafeed data.) And that’s pretty typical for other trailing periods. As a result, relative returns were highly dependent on efficiency: very large funds with very low expense ratios, able to place bids on very large lots of very efficiently priced bonds, had a nearly unbeatable structural advantage. 10-year performance difference between the top quartile and the bottom quartile Core bond: 0.5% annually (per MFO Premium) Core stock: 1.6% annually (per Morningstar) In a world where US Treasury bonds are the world’s safest investment and among its most reliably profitable, it was an unbeatable recipe. We might be leaving that world behind, which suggests we might need to consider possibilities where diversification and manager judgment might add substantial value. That implies the possibility of considering an ongoing stake in credit rather than just investment grade, in international rather than just U.S., in special situations rather than just vanilla auctions, and in shorter durations. For intelligent investors—regardless of whether financial analysis is a daily habit or a distant interest—it’s becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the mounting alarm bells surrounding the United States’ fiscal outlook. In mid-2025, the national debt stands at over $37 trillion, a sum now greater than the entire American economy. This staggering figure reflects years of budget deficits and a political climate where policy decisions often appear driven more by ideology, self-interest and brinkmanship than any rational economic strategy. Even major investors, once reliant on U.S. Treasury bonds for security, are beginning to question how much longer the world’s largest borrower can sustainably fund its needs without consequence (Drew Desilver, “Key facts about the US national debt,” Pew Research, 8/12/2025). (Sources: Historical Debt Outstanding, US Treasury; Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, 9/2025) These fiscal realities are not happening in isolation. As the U.S. government takes on more debt, with rising costs just to pay interest, confidence in federal bonds has begun to erode. Recent episodes of political gridlock over spending caps and the debt limit have highlighted just how reactive and unpredictable U.S. fiscal policy has become. The practical effect is a new era of vulnerability for traditional income portfolios anchored almost solely on U.S. Treasuries and investment-grade corporates. Investors are seeing the value of home-country assets increasingly shaped by fiscal risk and short-term fixes rather than predictable economic fundamentals. In contrast, a growing number of foreign markets not only boast more attractive valuations but also signal ripening opportunities as non-U.S. economies chart their own paths out of stagnation. Diversification, therefore, isn’t simply about chasing higher yields or speculating abroad—it’s emerging as a necessary hedge against the potential excesses of U.S.-centric fiscal and market dynamics. One measure of that changed dynamic is Research Affiliates’ estimates of the risks and returns, given a series of uniform economic assumptions, of dozens of asset classes. The following table gives the 10 highest Sharpe assets plus the US bond aggregate. Categories in black are fixed income (seven of 11), and blue are equity. (Source: Research Affiliates, Asset Allocation Interactive, 9/2025) By contrast, the three asset classes with negative expected 10-year Sharpe ratios are US Large-Cap stocks (-0.03), Developed Markets Large Growth stocks (-0.06), and US Large Growth stocks (-0.12). Bottom line: investors need to consider looking for core exposure, not just 5% nibbles, in areas beyond the common. The bad news is that many of the most intriguing income investments are not easily accessible to most investors: closed-end interval funds such as RBC Blue Ray Destra International Event-Driven Credit (CEDIX) or Carlyle Tactical Private Credit (TAKNX), often have high minimums and limited brokerage access. Others, such as SEI Opportunistic Income (SIIT) Fund and GMO Emerging Country Debt, are institutional. Those structural quirks – the ability to use leverage and to lock large investments in place by denying investors the chance to redeem at will – give those managers exceptional advantages. That said, there are intriguing options available to regular investors. We searched the MFO Premium database for funds that met six criteria: And, finally, they had to be purchasable. Sixteen funds survived the cut. The funds are sorted by Sharpe ratio. How to read that chart: The first three columns are easy. Name, Lipper fund category, and average yearly return over the past four years. Down capture is the percentage of the US bond market’s downside that the fund captured. A negative down capture means the fund tended to rise when the US bond market fell. The R-squared (R2) measures the degree of correlation between the fund and the US bond market: 100 means that the fund marches in lockstep with the bond market; 0 means the fund is completely independent of it. Finally, visual represents of three performance metrics: a maximum drawdown rating (how far the fund fell relative to its peers), downside deviation rating (called “bad deviation,” it’s a measure of how much a fund routinely falls relative to its peers) and Ulcer rating (our favorite: a measure of how far a fund falls and how long it takes to recover; deep fall + long recovery = massive investor ulcers). In each case, a blue cell signals top 20% performance. MFO does not make “sell now!” or “buy now!” calls, much less predictions about “the 10 funds you absolutely must own!” Those calls are easy to make, impossible to make reliably. Our argument is simpler: we are in the midst of a fiscal mess, which is likely to get messier and messier. It would be prudent, before any panic sets in, to examine the question: are there ways to reduce my exposure to emerging risks and still earn a decent return? The funds above have made money over the past five years; the US bond market has not. Those funds uniformly aim to provide high current income with admirably low exposure to the traditional income markets. And it reminds us, again, of the consistent independence and excellence of the CrossingBridge folks who are responsible for the two highest-rated funds on the list (CrossingBridge Low Duration and RiverPark Strategic Income).

Title: MicroCo Wants to Be the Alpha Werewolf Billionaire That Vertical Dramas Need

Laugh at vertical dramas’ alpha werewolf pregnant billionaire storytelling all you want, but don’t let the giggling distract you. Vertical dramas are massive. For young filmmakers they offer a low-barrier entry point. For entrepreneurial producers, they’re a chance to become mini-mini moguls. In 2024 alone, over 36,000 new series launched. Already a $7 billion business in China, the market is projected to top $10 billion globally (outside China) by 2027. Last month, Cineverse — the folks who brought you “Terrifier” — and Lloyd Braun’s Banyan Ventures announced MicroCo, a new microseries studio and platform.

The ambition isn’t to be another ReelShort or DramaBox. It wants to be the Amazon Prime of vertical drama, producing originals and curating the best from thousands of existing titles. I spoke with Cineverse president and Chief Strategy Officer Erick Opeka about MicroCo’s ambitions and why he sees vertical dramas as the next inflection point. Full disclosure: I’m excited to see what happens with vertical dramas and I’m a little bit conflicted about that. This is filmmaking at its most disposable. For this format that’s a feature, not a bug. It’s storytelling that leans into the dopamine with cliffhangers every two minutes; logic and nuance are roadkill. China can’t create a $7 billion business without America taking notice, but we might be slower to respond if we weren’t living through a moment otherwise defined by layoffs, consolidation, and other forms of retreat (Neuehouse, RIP). Growth feels good. Like it or not, this is a ground floor — but not for long. My interview with Erick has been edited for brevity and clarity. In Development: When did vertical video first cross your desk? Erick Opeka: A couple of years ago. In another incarnation we were owned by a Chinese company, so we’ve always been keeping an eye on trends. It was starting to pop up around the same time TikTok started to take hold. I saw it start to be something we were interested in maybe about 18 months ago. What do you see as the potential for this? If you look at the evolution in China, it’s not just targeted toward women looking for romance. About 550 million people in China viewed vertical microdramas as of the summer of this year. It’s gotten so big that it’s stealing mindshare from the more legacy streaming services. It’s resonating with their daily use patterns and cadence and mobile-first society. The pattern we’re already seeing in the US — the very soapy stuff taking hold, becoming a billion-dollar business in the US, and the top apps beating out Netflix and Hulu and Disney in the app store in revenue generated — tells me over the next five years, you’re going to see that happen here. What’s compelling is there’s no ecosystem around this in the US today, even though it’s already a billion-dollar business. I hear anecdotal things, but there’s no PR channels, no IMDB for this stuff. And these things are like mayflies, right? They premiere, they get mined of their value in two to three weeks, and then they’re into the ether and it’s on to the next one. It kind of hearkens back to the early days of cinema and the nickelodeon, and there was no star system yet. You had the Biograph Girl. It parallels a lot of what you would see in the early development of a new medium. Our goal is to build out the Roku or Amazon Prime of the space for the US. The other opportunity is there’s a lot that are clearly not professionally produced storytelling. It’s not so much the production value, but how do you maximize the storytelling? Putting together a team like Susan, Lloyd, and Jana, they understand big, brash storytelling. We’re not coming in with any kind of hubris that we’re going to reinvent the format. The format works. It’s about going back to the basics and doing a better job with western-style storytelling for US audiences. How would you distribute this? You have to have your own app to be a credible player. We’re a tech company. I have the engineering team and staff. We operate hundreds of apps in the ecosystem, so this is not something that is unfamiliar to us. The other piece is what I’ve seen as TikTok evolved into a multi-platform media company. They have connected TV apps, they have smart TV apps. It’s growing quite fast. I didn’t think vertical video on a big TV was going to work, and it’s kind of working to some degree. It’s just weird. Maybe people want to use their phone to text and goof around, and these stories are light engagement. The other thing is if we serve as the Hulu or Amazon or whatever analogy you want to make, there is no catalog value to most of these things. [We’d be] aggregating them, providing the fan layer, providing the information so people can find them. We’d also be working with major media companies, mobile providers, and others to provide our app or create a custom version of the content. We’d also produce, much like Prime, a nice layer of premium things. A lot of people see the team we’re putting together and think this is somehow going to be some ludicrous overspending. It’s quite the opposite. It’s like a puzzle we’re all trying to solve: How do you do what is already being done, without spending much more, and just do it better than it’s being done? There’s no need to put A-list talent in a $250,000-produced micro drama. This audience isn’t going to resonate with that, anyway. I think microdramas are going to serve a two-way approach. One is IP that will graduate into bigger phenomenon, and bigger IP will make the format stay top of mind — rather than going to the movies two or three times a year for most Americans. But it’s got to graduate from Harlequin romance-style stuff. Don’t get me wrong, we’re going to play that up. If you saw the names of some of the shows we’re contemplating — we’re like, how do we one-up everybody at this game of just getting ridiculous with it? We’re going to have fun with it. Are you looking to produce, or is this going to be acquisitions of independents? What’s the plan there? It’s going to be a mix. We’re starting to see some companies and producers that are getting really good at this. Most are kind of outside the system [or] recent film school grads from top programs that have been trying to break in. They’ve gotten good at scaling and figuring out how to do it. Very entrepreneurial. Some of the top producers in the space have very little to no Hollywood background. These are all indies. Right? I interviewed one of the vertical filmmakers, Yun Xie. She was fascinating. She made a feature that won Slamdance. Really? Yeah. And she was awesome. She’s a powerhouse. I was so impressed by her energy. So many directors come off as brash. That’s not her, but she’s very clearly focused. You hit the nail on the head, right? If you look back to the ‘90s indie film world vibe of just how excited people were and they were excited to get up every day and try to figure out how to get their movie and just crack the space. There was a palpable excitement around it. I feel that same kind of energy. I agree. People feel like, not only do I have a shot to get things made and do things and move forward with something that’s fun, compelling and new, but there’s real money to be made. I mean, you got to make a lot more of them to make money, but the money that’s being spent in this space is not immaterial anymore. What kinds of budgets are you looking at? The numbers have been all over the board and a lot of it reflects the indie film world. Cheaper it is, the more sweat equity and favors are being called — they’re doing these for below six figures. The price point is settling anywhere between $150,000 and $400,000. There’s people who are starting to become known and those cost a little more. And just because it’s a white-hot space, there’s not a ton of experienced producers. Demand is outstripping the supply, driving up prices a little bit right now. How many do you think you’ll produce or release in a year? We’re still working on that number. We’re going for a little higher quality as opposed to quantity. I don’t think we’re going to be at the cadence of the top players that drop one microdrama a day. But maybe one a week. Maybe two a week, toward the back half of our first year. How are you going to handle payment? There’s this whole system of coins and you lose track of what you’re actually spending. “It’s just one more coin.” You add it up all up at the end and holy crap, I just spent $40. Yeah. This business was spawned out of gaming companies who use a lot of these techniques to unlock levels. Every two minutes, beginning, middle, end, cliffhanger. It’s designed to hook you in. It drives high levels of engagement. Early adopters have a willingness to pay a lot more money. [But] look at what happened in streaming to expand and get the last corners of everybody. You’ve had to launch a lot of ad-supported, subsidized, lower-price things because most people can’t afford to pay 40 bucks to watch a soapy microdrama. Apps have already started to develop subscription levels, which are equally expensive. $20 a week or $200 a year, which is insane when you think about it. Over time, this business starts to look more like traditional media, but I think the coin piece will always kind of be hanging around. They’ll probably just get cheaper. In China there’s a lot of pressure for this to be far more ad supported. You’ll see the same dynamics here. If someone produced a vertical independently, what is the price point that you’d be looking at to buy it? If it’s great it’s going to get the market rates, which are in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars. If it’s experimental or they’re a new producer, it might be less than that. But this is [only] one opportunity. Normally filmmakers complain a lot about the rev share model. That’s feast-or-famine, [but] even moderately successful microdramas can make a lot of money. There’s a real opportunity for rev share on these. It’s like making a Netflix movie. You make it, you sell it, you bake in your profit margin and on to the next one. But if people get really good at it, if they build their own franchises, if they have their own characters, You’re going to see exactly what’s evolved in traditional entertainment economics: They’re going to demand [rev share] and they’re going to get it. A detailed statistical analysis of one of the biggest questions looming over every young cinephile’s mind: Do I need to go to film school? Whatever you think of the term “NonDē” as a replacement for “independent” — I see the logic, but find it aesthetically hideous and overcomplicated — this is an insightful article about the evolving role of film festivals for filmmakers who accept that the game has changed. Another data-driven story that serves as a nuanced counterpoint to the adage that Hollywood is completely run by sequels. That’s still largely true, of course, but Thomson offers a deep dive into the level of performance required for a film to receive a larger investment for a sequel. It’s a pessimistic take on the larger state of the traditional film industry, but those seem to be the only honest ones. A nuts-and-bolts roundup of high quality advice for anyone wrestling with the question “how do I become a director?” Horton offers a healthy mix of old advice that has maintained its relevance in a changing world and newer tips that feel fresh today, but anyone looking to launch a filmmaking career could do a lot worse than using this as a primer. Writing for the Business of TV Substack, Topping offers another potential explanation for the surge in vertical drama popularity: the medium is becoming the only place to enjoy the kind of romantic melodrama that used to be readily available on bigger screens. It’s a thoughtful analysis of an age-old phenomenon: when the larger entertainment industry stops serving a popular product, somebody else will inevitably emerge to fill the void.

Major U.S. equities indexes ticked higher as markets kicked off a new trading week. Inflation is likely to remain in focus as investors look toward Thursday's release of the latest Consumer Price Index data, which could influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates next week. The S&P 500 added 0.2% Monday, while the Nasdaq rose 0.5% to a record closing high, and the Dow ended 0.3% higher. Shares of video game maker Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) surged 3.8% to reach an all-time high and secure the top daily performance in the S&P 500 after the company launched its latest professional basketball game and announced plans to develop a college basketball game. Uber Technologies (UBER) shares drove 3.7% higher after it announced plans with self-driving technology firm Momenta to begin testing autonomous vehicles in Munich, Germany, in 2026. The company also moved to sell $2.25 billion in investment-grade bonds, Bloomberg reported, with the proceeds directed toward general corporate purposes. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) added 3.2%, extending strong gains late last week after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected earnings. A surge in artificial intelligence revenue underpinned the strong performance, and Broadcom said it had secured $10 billion in orders from a new client, which reports said could be OpenAI. CVS Health (CVS) shares dropped 4.8%, losing the most of any stock in the S&P 500 on Monday, after top executives at a Morgan Stanley investor conference did not offer new financial forecasts or updates on the federal government's impending release of star ratings for Medicare Advantage plans, which could have a significant impact on revenue CVS derives from plans operated through its Aetna insurance business. One of the executives speaking at the conference reportedly stressed CVS has a policy of not updating its guidance between quarterly earnings releases. Shares of alcoholic beverage maker Brown-Forman (BF.B) fell 4.6%. The stock has been trending downward since the Jack Daniel's parent last month posted a lower-than-expected profit. The company noted a negative impact from the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada. The company said it also faces headwinds related to economic uncertainty and the potential for price pressure related to oversupply in the American whiskey market. Including Monday's decline, Brown-Forman shares have lost more than one-quarter of their value this year. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) announced a plan to offer around $3.25 billion in senior and exchangeable notes, as well as launch a registered direct offering of ordinary shares. The former adds to the company's debt levels, while the latter dilutes the ownership stake of existing stockholders. Shares of the cruise operator sank 4.4% on Monday.

Title: The Cost Of Living The American Dream For A Lifetime Has Reached A Whopping 5 Million Dollars

Time Published: 2025-09-08T20:48:51Z
Full Content:
The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? What in the world has happened to us? When I was growing up, it was assumed that pretty much everyone in my generation would be able to achieve the American Dream. But today most of the U.S. population is not living the American Dream, and more people are falling out of the middle class every day. As I have detailed in previous articles, this is particularly true for Millennials and those in Generation Z. The collective prosperity of the middle class has been declining for an extended period of time, and now that long-term decline threatens to become a full-blown avalanche. Borrowing money always creates pain, and since 2009 our leaders in Washington have borrowed and spent 27 trillion dollars that we did not have. Pumping all of that extra money into the system has had very serious consequences, because now the purchasing power of our dollars has been greatly diminished. In fact, Newsweek is reporting that the cost of living the American Dream for a lifetime has now reached 5 million dollars… The American Dream has long symbolized the promise of opportunity, prosperity, and upward mobility. Coined in 1931 by writer James Truslow Adams in The Epic of America, the term described “that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement.” But nearly a century later, achieving that vision is more expensive than ever. According to new research published by Investopedia, the lifetime cost of attaining the traditional American Dream—including homeownership, retirement, raising children, a wedding, new cars, healthcare, pets, and annual vacations—now totals roughly $5 million. These calculations assume a college-educated, dual-income household capable of sustaining these ambitions over a lifetime. Is your household going to bring in 5 million dollars over the course of your lifetime? Sadly, most U.S. households don’t have a prayer of getting anywhere even close to that. But if you want to live the American Dream for an entire lifetime, that is what it is going to take. We live at a time when virtually everything is steadily becoming more expensive. In a previous article, I explained that each month an average family of four spends $996 on groceries, $1,437 on health insurance, $745 on a vehicle payment and $2,259 on a mortgage payment. Once upon a time, it was quite common for Americans to have large families. But in our time raising children has become so expensive. In fact, it is being estimated that the cost of raising two children all the way through college will cost you $876,092… Raising two children from infancy through college remains one of the costliest undertakings. Using Economic Policy Institute data, Investopedia calculates $650,000 to cover childcare, transportation, meals, and other expenses, with college costs exceeding $230,000 for two children. “College is more expensive than ever, and many students take on a lot of debt, only to find that their paychecks don’t grow fast enough to pay it off quickly,” Battin said. According to the Education Data Initiative, the average cost of college is $38,270 per student per year, including books, supplies, and daily living expenses. This is one of the reasons why our society values money so much at this stage. The truth is that it takes a giant pile of money each month just to live a normal life. Older Americans are far more likely to be living a middle class lifestyle right now because they control most of the wealth… As young buyers scrape together down payments, boomers are sitting on $82 trillion in wealth—more than twice what Gen X has and four times as much as millennials. New research shows the wealth gap has only widened since the 1980s, as older generations saw bigger gains in homeownership and stocks while younger people took on faster-growing mortgage debt. With boomers holding on to large homes and aging in place, younger buyers are struggling to break into a shrinking market. I know lots of Americans that are over the age of 50 that are successfully living middle class lifestyles in 2025. But I know of very few Americans that are under the age of 40 that are successfully living middle class lifestyles in 2025. Over the past several decades, homeownership among young adults has absolutely collapsed. I shared the following chart that was posted by Nathan Halberstadt on Twitter in a previous article, but I felt that I should share it again in order to illustrate this point… Just look at that chart. That is what a long-term economic collapse looks like. And I don’t think that anybody is even going to attempt to argue that I am wrong about that. The middle class is being systematically eviscerated. As older middle class Americans die off, they are not being replaced in sufficient numbers by young adults that are entering the middle class. In 2025, most of the population is just barely scraping by from month to month. Debt levels have risen to extremely alarming levels, and so have delinquency rates. This week, I was deeply saddened to learn that the delinquency rate on subprime auto loans has soared to the highest level ever recorded… The auto loan landscape is teetering on the edge of chaos as delinquency rates climb to unprecedented heights. Data from the Federal Reserve and Goldman Sachs reveal that subprime auto loan delinquencies have rocketed past 5%, a stark milestone that surpasses the worst days of the 2008 financial crisis. According to Experian, 30-day-plus delinquencies over the past year have risen 40% among consumers with the lowest credit scores, signaling growing distress among high-risk borrowers. Skyrocketing car prices, coupled with elevated interest rates and mounting economic pressures, are stretching household finances to the breaking point, leading to a surge in missed payments. Prime auto loan delinquencies, while reaching a 15-year high, but short of the crisis-era peak, suggest a more limited ripple effect among borrowers with better credit. It is starting to look a lot like 2008 all over again. And that includes mass layoffs. Large employers have been eliminating good paying jobs all over the nation, and in many cases these layoffs are being driven by the AI revolution… The list of companies laying off companies is growing following two years of significant job cuts in tech, media, finance, manufacturing, retail, and energy. According to Business Insider, a World Economic Forum survey found that some 41% of companies worldwide expect to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. Big companies such as Oracle, CNN, Dropbox, and Block have all previously announced layoffs linked to AI. While Amazon has not reported any job cuts this year, CEO Andy Jassy warned employees in June that the company will likely require “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today” in the coming years as it increases its adoption of generative AI and AI agents. If things are this bad now, what will happen once AI can do almost all of our jobs less expensively and more efficiently than humans can? Of course AI is not the only reason why so many Americans are losing their jobs right now. As I discussed yesterday, this is the toughest job market that we have seen in ages. But don’t just take my word for it. According to the New York Fed, “confidence in the ability to move from one job to another has hit a record low”… In the latest sign of trouble for the U.S. labor market, confidence in the ability to move from one job to another has hit a record low, according to a New York Federal Reserve survey released Monday. Respondents to the central bank’s monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations for August indicated a 44.9% probability of finding another job after losing their current one. The reading tumbled 5.8 percentage points from the prior month and is the lowest in the survey’s history dating back to June 2013. The economy is a mess. That is very clear. And it is also very clear that we are moving into an extremely challenging future. But that doesn’t mean that you should curl up into a fetal position and cry about it. You were born for such a time as this. It is when times are the darkest that the greatest lights are needed. Living the American Dream does not determine whether you are a “success” or not. You are living at one of the most important moments in all of human history, and you have been given a purpose that only you can fulfill. Yes, all of the crazy stuff that is happening all around us can be frightening at times, but don’t let all of that noise prevent you from becoming everything that you were created to be.

September 08, 2025 16:17 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=165537&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.

Ethereum has quietly been one of the most rewarding bets in crypto. A $1,000 investment made just five years ago in 2020 would now be worth around $11,145, an 11x jump despite wild swings along the way. But with ETH trading around $4,327 this September, investors are asking the real question: is Ethereum still worth buying after such explosive gains, or is the big money already made?

Title: On theCUBE Pod: AI factories, custom silicon deals and the race for infrastructure scale

UPDATED 13:26 EDT / SEPTEMBER 08 2025 by Chad Wilson Artificial intelligence is no longer just a software story — it is the foundation for AI factories, where chips, data pipelines and networks work together as production systems for digital outcomes. This emerging model is redefining how performance is measured and how value is created across industries. These AI factories combine custom semiconductors, low-latency fabrics and massive data instrumentation into real-time feedback loops that generate competitive advantage. They are reshaping business models as chipmakers secure long-term custom contracts and enterprises harness telemetry to transform traditional experiences into living, digital ecosystems. The economics of compute now rival the economics of manufacturing. This framing sets the stage for the latest episode of theCUBE Pod with theCUBE Research’s John Furrier (pictured, left) and Dave Vellante (right), who explored how Broadcom Inc., Nvidia Corp. and IBM Corp. are navigating this shift. Their conversation ranged from real-time analytics at the U.S. Open to the rise of custom silicon deals and the broader race to scale AI-powered infrastructure. “This is going to be a continuing boom for the Broadcoms and the Nvidias because they’re the arms dealers and the supply chain,” Furrier said. “Nvidia is going after the enterprise. Broadcom is taking more of an open approach.” The concept of AI factories came up repeatedly as a lens for interpreting today’s market. The phrase underscores that compute resources are not abstract tools, but production lines for data-driven outcomes. Broadcom and Nvidia illustrate two ends of this spectrum. Nvidia pursues a vertically integrated model where hardware, software and systems are tightly coupled. Broadcom takes a modular approach, pursuing multi-year custom silicon deals while pairing semiconductors with software to balance cycles, according to Vellante. “They’ve turned the US open into an AI data factory,” he said about theCUBE’s recent attendance at the sporting event. “They don’t use that marketing. That’s Dell and Nvidia, but it really is a data factory. They’ve got over a hundred years of matched data. They got all the history on where the balls lands. The note I have here is four and a half million data points per match and it’s unbelievable.” The US Open became a showcase of AI factory economics, with IBM’s watsonx processing millions of data points in near real time across 17 courts. Broadcom’s $16 billion quarter underscored the same theme: Long-term chip deals and capital-intensive ecosystems are redefining vendor strategies, customer experiences and enterprise value, Furrier explained. “The OpenAI deal represents what I call the white box model for the large-scale clusters, which is simply there will be a market that will rise up to feed the demand for essentially custom chips that will feed into what could be a clone of Nvidia, meaning purpose-built systems,” he said. “OpenAI had a huge incentive in cash to vertically integrate their own. We’ve been having this debate, heterogeneous versus homogenous.” Beyond the headlines on earnings and chip design, the broader conversation centered on how ecosystems evolve. AI factories are not just hyperscaler phenomena. Their influence touches enterprises through partnerships, data integration strategies and the application of agentic workflows. That’s why upcoming conversations in the AI factories series are significant: They extend the debate from chips and cloud clusters into enterprise readiness, interoperability and governance, Vellante emphasized. “Broadcom … almost $16 billion in revenue, up 23% in the quarter. That’s just the quarter, operating income at six billion, almost 37% of revenue,” he said in reference to their place in the industry. “Their free cash flow is $7 billion, 45% of revenue — that’s higher than Microsoft; that’s higher than Nvidia. The thing about Broadcom … they have these long duration, high value, multi-year, multi-billion-dollar custom chip deals.” Nvidia’s integrated approach, framed by “Jensen’s Law,” highlights doubling performance annually, though its enterprise impact remains in question. Both Nvidia and Broadcom are benefiting from AI demand, while Salesforce Inc., IBM and others push agentic, data-driven growth. Yet Wall Street often overlooks these strategies, underscoring why financial and technical roadmaps remain inseparable. “I would say that Nvidia’s on the learning curve and Nvidia’s ahead of everybody to the extent that you need the latest greatest,” Vellante explained. “They are furthest along on the learning curve, which means they have the most innovation and the lowest cost, not the lowest price of course, but that’s their moat. I see it continuing for quite some time unless and until those laws become non-immutable.” Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI David Sacks, White House AI and crypto czar Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Jim Cramer, American TV personality and author Arvind Krishna, chairman and CEO of IBM Bruno Aziza, group VP, data, BI and AI at IBM Aaron Rakers, managing director and technology analyst at Wells Fargo Pat Gelsinger, former CEO of Intel Paul Maritz, chairman at Pivotal and former CEO of VMware Jeff Bezos, chairman of Amazon Michael Dell, chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies Marc Benioff, chair and CEO of Salesforce George Gilbert, principal analyst at theCUBE Research Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase Sarbjeet Johal, founder and CEO of Stackpane Jonathan Cantor, SVP and deputy chief privacy officer of Truist Lina Khan, former chair of the FTC Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft Janet Reno, former U.S. attorney general Jack Ma, Chinese business magnate and investor Donald Trump, 45th and 47th president of the United States of America Here’s the full episode of this week’s theCUBE Pod: Don’t miss out on the latest episodes of “theCUBE Pod.” Join us by subscribing to our RSS feed.

Reviews ethics statement Use these Alexa commands to manage your life without lifting a finger. These voice commands make Alexa the ultimate sidekick. Alexa has evolved far beyond its origins as a simple voice assistant for setting reminders and playing music. After 11 years, it finally got a significant upgrade with the introduction of Alexa Plus. This new iteration is powered by advanced AI, making the assistant smarter, more conversational, and, for the first time, proactive. With Alexa Plus, the assistant can manage your smart devices, organize a dynamic calendar, control your Fire TV, and even follow you from one speaker to another as you move through your home. This deeper integration makes for a more seamless user experience. If you haven't used Alexa in a while, its new commands are designed to keep up with the demands of a busy life. This CNET survey found that 73% of US adults who use voice assistants still have privacy concerns with AI features, but Alexa was rated the most trusted option among them. If you own an Echo device, learning the right commands is the key to unlocking everything Alexa can do. Here's a full guide to the best ones to start with. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $20 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa Plus aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Before that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

Title: Broadcom vs. Nvidia: Not a zero-sum game

UPDATED 12:08 EDT / SEPTEMBER 08 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante We believe the prevailing narrative that Broadcom Inc. and Nvidia Corp. are locked in a zero-sum battle for artificial intelligence data center dominance is misleading. The reality is these companies are playing very different games. Nvidia has built a vertically integrated compute and software platform that has become the engine of the AI factory era. Broadcom, by contrast, has constructed a durable business model around connectivity, custom silicon, and high-margin software. The strategies overlap but are not mutually exclusive. We believe the real story is how these firms are carving out complementary positions in the most important technology cycle since the dawn of the internet. In this Breaking Analysis, we examine the different strategies of Broadcom and Nvidia and explain why the success of one doesn’t necessarily mean dilution to the others’ prospects. Nvidia’s strategy is straightforward in concept but extraordinarily difficult to replicate. The company builds a full-stack platform that starts with graphics processing units and extends across the system. Jensen Huang has repeatedly emphasized that the unit of competition is no longer the chip, but the system or what Nvidia coined as the AI factory. Nvidia has positioned itself as the indispensable supplier for anyone looking to stand up these factories. At the core of Nvidia’s stack are GPUs such as Hopper and Blackwell, paired with NVLink/NVSwitch interconnects to form tightly coupled compute domains. These “pods” scale to 72 GPUs, creating high-bandwidth, low-latency islands optimized for extreme parallel processing workloads such as AI training. Nvidia extends these pods outward using InfiniBand, a proprietary network technology it captured from its Mellanox acquisition. In addition, Nvidia leverages its Spectrum-X Ethernet, a purpose-built Ethernet fabric designed to handle AI traffic deterministically. On top of the hardware sits its CUDA software stack and hundreds of libraries that represent the software glue that makes these systems programmable and highly tuned. Nvidia’s software moat is deep, with tens of thousands of developers locked into its ecosystem and wide supporting a virtually infinite number of use cases. In addition, the company offers systems and services such as DGX, NIMS inference microservices and Omniverse for simulation and digital twins, further solidifying its position as a platform, not just a chip supplier. The cadence of innovation is relentless. Each year, Nvidia launches new architectures that deliver better performance per watt and higher utilization of the cluster. This annual rhythm turns capital spending into a recurring monetization cycle. The result, when power is a constraint and systems are underutilized, is that customers spend more, generate more tokens per watt, and reduce unit cost at scale. Broadcom’s approach is significantly different from that of Nvidia. Chief Executive Hock Tan and Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, are not chasing GPUs or building giant AI systems. Instead, Broadcom’s playbook is to identify durable franchises – markets with a decade or more of runway – establish technology leadership, and run them with intense operating discipline. Some investors have shied away from Broadcom citing it as a “commodity player.” In our view, this narrative is misguided and lacks an understanding of the engineering investments required to deliver the products Broadcom produces, including in its wireless portfolio. In semiconductors, Broadcom has staked its claim in connectivity. Its Tomahawk and Jericho families dominate merchant Ethernet switching. It has also secured custom silicon design wins with Google, Meta and likely ByteDance, embedding Broadcom deep into the hyperscale AI buildout. These are multibillion-dollar, long-duration deals that are highly strategic. The company just announced it closed another $10 billion custom chip deal, widely known to be with OpenAI, which, like the hyperscalers, is designing its own chips to reduce its reliance on Nvidia. On the last earnings call, Tan had what appeared to be an inadvertent and ironic “tell” saying the following: Today’s AI rack scales up a mere 72 GPUs at 28.8 terabit per second bandwidth using proprietary NVLink. On the other hand, earlier this year, we have launched Tomahawk 5 with OpenAI — with open Ethernet, sorry, which can scale up 512 compute nodes for customers using XPUs. This slip of the tongue came right after he announced the most recent $10 billion custom chip deal, leading many observers, including us, to conclude that OpenAI was clearly embedded (in a good way) in Tan’s head space. Charlie Kawwas’ mantra is “OSP.” It stands for open, scalable, power-efficient and frames Broadcom’s philosophy. The company bets that open standards such as Ethernet and PCIe will ultimately win out over proprietary approaches such as InfiniBand and NVLink. History suggests this is a good bet, which is why Nvidia has also embraced Ethernet. In software, Broadcom has reshaped VMware around VMware Cloud Foundation, announcing VCF 9.0 claiming the integration of all those disparate VMware software modules was achieved with thousands of engineers creating the bundle. Broadcom’s strategy to force customers into higher-value contracts, though controversial, has driven operating margins above 70% and gross margins over 90%, substantially better than other software-as-a-service gross margins. Moreover, VMware has become the most robust on-premises alternative to public cloud and represents the most mature private cloud offering on the market, in our view. The quirk of Broadcom’s VMware strategy is that alternatives such as Hyper-V, Nutanix, Red Hat and others have gained momentum, where previously they were shut out as virtualization plays. Broadcom doesn’t want the customers unwilling to pay up for the full VCF stack, but alternative players that don’t have nearly the profitability profile of Broadcom are happy to take the business. The graphic below shows Enterprise Technology Research’s Net Score methodology for the virtualization market. The vertical axis (Net Score) represents the net percentage of customers spending more on each platform and the horizontal axis shows penetration into the data set. The data would lead one to believe that VMware is struggling, noting its precipitous drop from January 2023. But the methodology doesn’t capture amount of spend. As such, it misses the fact that Broadcom’s strategy has been to focus its efforts more narrowly on those high value customers willing to spend on the whole VCF bundle to lower total cost of ownership. This is a classic Broadcom move. It only competes in markets where it can dominate. In the case of VMware, it’s not the number of logos that matters, rather its the number of customers that willing to absorb price increases and buy the full bundle. Contrary to many misguided narratives, Broadcom invests heavily in engineering and surrounds its platform with critical technologies that drive clear return on investment. This is why (for example) even Nvidia buys networking technologies from Broadcom. The bottom line is that Broadcom doesn’t need to win in GPUs head-to-head with Nvidia to thrive. Instead, it supplies the glue — SerDes, NICs, optics and switches — that make large AI systems possible. In Kawwas’ words, Broadcom doesn’t make GPUs, it makes the stuff that makes XPUs and HBMs work. In addition, it has secured multibillion-dollar, long-duration contracts to build custom AI chips for some of the top companies in the world, including Google, Meta, ByteDance and now OpenAI. A major flashpoint between the two companies is the question of scale. On Broadcom’s most recent earnings call, Tan depositioned Nvidia’s NVLink 72 as “scaling up a mere 72 GPUs at 28.8 terabits per second,” contrasting it with Broadcom’s Ethernet fabrics that can connect 512 nodes using Tomahawk 5. At face value, this makes Nvidia’s approach sound limited. But the comparison is misleading in our view. The way we interpret Nvidia’s use of the “scale up, out, across” terminology is as follows: Broadcom, in Tan’s remark, appears to have used “scale up” more loosely to mean “supporting larger clusters than 72 GPUs.” But technically, connecting 512 compute nodes with Ethernet is a scale-out fabric, not scale-up. In particular, scale-up is generally thought of as making a single logical system bigger by tightly coupling components. Think symmetric multiprocessing in a single box. In our view, Tan was depositioning NVLink’s rack-level island (72 GPUs) as small, contrasting it with Broadcom’s Ethernet-based ability to connect hundreds of nodes. In doing so, he takes liberty with the terminology, calling Ethernet’s cluster expansion “scale up,” when in fact in classic parlance it’s scale-out. In contrast, Nvidia’s 72 GPUs refers to a tightly coupled NVLink domain where high-bandwidth memory pools are shared across GPUs, enabling highly efficient parallel operations. Broadcom’s 512 nodes really refers to the scale-out capability of Ethernet fabrics. It is not an apples-to-apples comparison. The two approaches solve different problems. NVLink maximizes performance within a rack, while Ethernet extends clusters across racks and rows. The tradeoff is that NVLink delivers peak performance per GPU, Ethernet delivers estate-level scalability and economics. In practice, operators use both – NVLink for high-performance compute islands, Ethernet for stitching those islands together. The financial models of Nvidia and Broadcom underscore their different strategies. On the surface, both companies post extraordinary results, but the way they get there is different. Nvidia today is running at a revenue pace of roughly $187 billion annually, up an impressive 56% year-over-year. Despite moderating from the triple-digit growth rates of prior quarters, this remains one of the fastest growth profiles of any mega-cap. Margins are equally impressive: 73% gross, 65% operating and 33% operating cash flow. With a market capitalization north of $4 trillion and a 22x run rate revenue multiple, Nvidia is being valued as a once-in-a-generation growth company, not a traditional semiconductor provider. In our view, this reflects investor conviction that Nvidia’s full-stack AI factory strategy has years of runway left, with annual cadence upgrades, CUDA software lock-in and hyperscaler demand elasticity sustaining momentum. And an economic value proposition that is compelling when power is the limiting factor and utilization/efficiency improvements can be achieved with rapid tech refreshes. In its recent earnings call, Nvidia stressed the ramp of Blackwell, with NVLink 72 deployments showing 10x efficiency gains on reasoning workloads compared with Hopper. Management highlighted that inference is now a meaningful revenue stream, alongside training. In terms of ROI, elasticity (Jevons paradox) is allowing Nvidia to cut price per token while still growing revenue. Broadcom, by contrast, is delivering exceptional results with a different playbook. The company is operating at an annualized revenue run rate of about $64 billion, growing a solid but more measured 22% year-over-year. This past quarter its non-AI semiconductor offerings were a headwind, but they’re expected to grow sequentially. Broadcom’s gross margin of 67% is lower than Nvidia’s, but Broadcom shines in cash generation, with 45% operating cash flow margin – a remarkable figure given the scale of the business. Operating margin sits at 37%, well below Nvidia’s, but consistent with Broadcom’s blend of semiconductors and infrastructure software. Its valuation, at roughly $1.6 trillion market cap and a 25x revenue multiple, is notable. Investors are waking up to Broadcom, not for its hypergrowth, but for its durability, discipline and strategic positioning as the connective tissue for AI infrastructure, the go-to firm for custom AI chips and the value creator of its VMware asset. Broadcom’s recent earnings highlighted Tomahawk 5’s ability to scale clusters well beyond the NVLink pod size. We note the caveats to Tan’s statements, as cited earlier. Tan reiterated that VMware Cloud Foundation adoption is ahead of schedule, with software margins approaching 70%. AI silicon revenue run-rate hit ~$16 billion, anchored by custom hyperscaler wins and an exciting $10 billion deal widely reported to be with OpenAI. In our opinion, these financial metrics underscore Nvidia as a hypergrowth platform company trading at a premium for its velocity, while Broadcom is a durable compounder valued for its consistency, cash flows and long-term franchises. Both models are exceptional, both companies are fundamental to the AI movement, but they reflect entirely different philosophies of how to capture value in the AI era. We believe the implications of these strategies are meaningful in the sense that: In our opinion, the market should stop framing Broadcom and Nvidia as rivals in a zero-sum contest. Moreover, the idea that Broadcom is a commodity play, as posited by some pundits, is absurd in our view. Nvidia and Broadcom are playing different games, both of which are essential to the AI era. Nvidia builds the compute engines and software platforms that drive new workloads. Broadcom ensures those engines can scale, interconnect and operate profitably over a decade-long horizon. Our research suggests that as AI moves from cloud to enterprise to real-world systems, both Nvidia and Broadcom will expand their moats in very different, but highly synergistic ways. The real battle is not between them, but between this new architecture and the legacy compute stack it is replacing.

Title: Wall Street Sees U.S. Entry as Catalyst for Bullish’s Next Leg Up
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/08/wall-street-sees-u-s-entry-as-catalyst-for-bullish-s-next-leg-up
Time Published: 2025-09-08T14:12:17Z
Full Content:
Crypto platform Bullish (BLSH), the parent company of CoinDesk, received a number of stock ratings from Wall Street analysts on Monday, as brokerage firms initiated coverage of the stock after its recent IPO. Rosenblatt Securities started coverage with a buy rating and a $60 price target, citing shifting U.S. political winds and rising institutional adoption as key catalysts for growth, the broker said in a research report Monday. The firm argues that Bullish, one of the largest regulated institutional exchanges, is well positioned to capitalize on what it calls a “dramatic improvement” in the U.S. political environment for digital assets. Despite not yet serving U.S. clients, Bullish has already handled more than $500 billion in annual trading volume, a scale Rosenblatt views as evidence of demand. The upcoming U.S. launch is expected to be a major catalyst, the broker noted, while the passage of the GENIUS Act has opened a new opportunity in stablecoins. Rosenblatt believes stablecoin-related revenue could provide recurring income less exposed to trading volatility. Stablecoin values are tied to assets like the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets providing, among other things, a payment infrastructure, and are also used to transfer money internationally. The sector has a market cap of about $280 billion, CoinGecko data show, and is dominated by Tether's USDT and Circle Internet's USDC. Bullish’s ownership of media properties and potential expansion into retail trading add further upside, according to the note. On that basis, Rosenblatt values the stock at 31x projected 2027 adjusted EBITDA, underpinning its $60 target. Rival broker Canaccord Genuity has also initiated coverage of Bullish with a buy rating and a $68 price target, highlighting the exchange’s growing institutional traction and potential boost from a pending New York BitLicense. Founded in 2020, Bullish has quickly become a major player in crypto trading, recently leading global regulated exchanges in spot trading volumes for bitcoin BTC$114,339.02, ether (ETH), and stablecoins, the report said. The company has expanded beyond trading with the acquisitions of CoinDesk in 2023 and CCData in 2024, adding media, data, and information services to its business lines. Canaccord analysts also note Bullish’s role in the emerging “stablecoin wars,” supporting issuers like PayPal (PYPL) and Société Générale (GLE) with listings, liquidity, and promotion. Already licensed in Europe and Asia, Bullish is expected to secure a BitLicense soon, opening access to U.S. institutional clients, the analysts wrote. Despite conservative assumptions in its forecasts, including flat bitcoin prices through 2027, Canaccord points to Bullish’s early profitability, balance sheet bolstered by $2.4 billion in bitcoin, and long-term growth prospects as reasons for optimism. Meanwhile, broker Bernstein has initiated coverage of Bullish with a market-perform rating and a $60 price target, highlighting the exchange’s experienced management team and its ambition to become the second-largest institutional platform after Coinbase. That outcome, the firm says, hinges on a successful U.S. launch in 2026, where Coinbase currently dominates but opportunities are emerging around stablecoins, market data and indices. Bullish’s ownership of CoinDesk also offers potential optionality if it moves into retail exchange services. "We expect Bullish to capture ~8% market share in U.S spot institutional crypto volumes by 2027E, while global spot market share remains at ~7%," analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) has also initiated coverage of Bullish, assigning the crypto exchange operator a neutral rating and a price target of $50. Like Bernstein, the JPMorgan analyst also pointed to Bullish’s experienced management team and its ability to navigate the fast-evolving digital asset landscape. The bank's analyst said growth will likely be fueled by rising institutional demand for crypto exposure and the increasing role of tokens and stablecoins in trading activity. Bullish is also well-positioned to expand into the U.S. market, building on its existing foothold in Europe and Asia. According to the bank, another growth driver will be its Liquidity Services business, where clearer regulation could broaden the range of supported blockchains and tokens, creating a stronger environment for exchanges like Bullish. Still, JPMorgan noted that the firm’s current scale remains limited relative to its market opportunity. With the company at what the bank called a “critical point of maturity,” analysts said valuation concerns justify staying on the sidelines for now. The shares were trading 3.6% lower, around $50.53, at publication time.

Title: S&P 500 Weekly Winners: How AI Powered The Surge
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/08/sp-500-weekly-winners-how-ai-powered-the-surge/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T13:28:50Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. During the week ending September 5, the S&P 500 was essentially unchanged, slipping 0.12%. In contrast, several S&P 500 constituents—particularly AI-related names—posted strong gains. The week’s top movers were propelled by upbeat quarterly surprises, sizable chip agreements, and constructive regulatory developments. Macroeconomic data pointed to a softer labor market: nonfarm payrolls in August rose by only 22,000, well below the 75,000 forecast, while the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3%. Together, these readings reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve will move forward with a widely anticipated interest rate cut later this month. We detail the biggest movers below. That said, if you’re seeking upside with less volatility than a single-stock position, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outpaced its blended benchmark—the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Also, see – S&P 500 Losers: From Lululemon To MGM — What Went Wrong? Western Digital’s stock climbed 15% last week on a strong earnings print and upbeat guidance for the coming quarters. WDC has nearly doubled in 2025, riding the AI wave as its high-performance storage is critical for AI data centers. At $93, WDC trades at about 2x trailing revenues, modestly above its five-year average P/S of 1.7x. The relative discount to its historical average, as well as some peers, reflects its heavier exposure to the more volatile NAND segment, recent market drawdowns, and historical concerns about earnings cyclicality. Broadcom advanced 13% last week, buoyed by strong quarterly results and news of a new $10 billion custom AI chip order from a major customer—seen as a meaningful accelerant to revenue growth. Our recent analysis — AVGO Stock To $400 — outlines how Broadcom could potentially double again after a 135% gain over the last twelve months. The company is leveraging deep semiconductor expertise to deliver bespoke AI hardware for hyperscale, cloud, and enterprise buyers. Seagate shares rose 12%, supported by expectations for sustained AI-driven storage demand, with the stock up 115% year to date. The enthusiasm for high-capacity drives used in AI workloads has pushed STX’s valuation, now at 4x trailing revenues—well above its five-year average of 1.9x. That premium suggests the market is pricing in elevated demand and earnings durability. Micron gained 10%, largely on rising demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) in AI infrastructure. Micron’s revenue multiple is 3.9x, close to its five-year average, implying today’s pricing reflects both current strength and cyclical risks—particularly as DRAM has entered an upcycle after a tough 2024, while NAND remains subdued. Even so, Micron may be AI’s best bargain. Google advanced 10% after a key regulatory win—a federal court found it wouldn’t need to divest Chrome, a platform we estimate is worth over a trillion to the ecosystem. The stock still appears relatively undervalued versus peers, with potential for an additional trillion-dollar upswing if further rulings are favorable; another decision due on September 10 could shape the next move. Remember, investing in a single stock—or a small handful—carries meaningful risk. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, a 30-stock collection that has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why? As a group, HQ names have delivered better returns with less volatility versus the benchmark—less of a roller-coaster ride—visible in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Adobe And Applied Materials Stand Out For Fat Profit Margins
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndorfman/2025/09/08/adobe-and-applied-materials-stand-out-for-fat-profit-margins/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T12:45:00Z

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. High profits are the engine that can drive pleasant returns for shareholders. Beyond that, on a societal level, profits provide the signals that make the capitalist system work. These signals are the reason capitalist economies have fewer gluts and shortages than centrally planned (Communist) economies. High profits lure in new competitors, raising the supply of goods and services that are in high demand. Low profits cause some companies to abandon the field, in a process the economist Joseph Schumpeter called “creative destruction.” This is why we don’t currently have a glut of buggy whips or video cassettes. Here are five stocks that boast unusually high profit margins, and that I think deserve consideration as investments. You may know Adobe Inc. (ADBE) as the company whose software enables the display of graphics on your computer screen. Adobe has increased its sales at a 20% annual clip for the past decade, and profits have grown even faster. Adobe’s growth slowed in the past year, but the growth rate was still nicely into the teens. The company’s net (after tax) profit margin is 30%. The stock trades for 22 times recent earnings but only 15 times analysts’ estimate of earnings for 2026. I try not to be too influenced by personal experiences, but I have found Adobe’s customer service to be superb. One of the world’s largest makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is based in Santa Clara, California. Its sales growth over the past decade has been north of 17% a year. Its net profit margin is close to 24%. Although the stock has appreciated more than 900% in the past ten years, so far this year it’s down a small fraction. I think the weakness mostly reflects the U.S.-China trade conflict. Applied Materials gets about 25% of its sales in China. Based in Denver, Colorado, Anglogold Ashanti Plc (AU) is a gold mining company. Most of its mines are in Africa, but it also has mines in Australia and the Americas. The price of gold has risen more than 40% in the past year, amid government deficits, inflation, and international tensions. I think those problems will continue through 2026 and that gold’s momentum therefore will continue as well. Anglogold Ashani has a net profit margin of more than 23%. United Therapeutics Corp. (UTHR), based in Silver Spring, Maryland, is known mainly for drugs to treat high blood pressure in the arteries around the lungs. I’ve owned the stock a couple of times over the years and regret that I haven’t owned it this year, since it jumped 33% in the past month. I sold my shares in 2024 because I thought that Merck & Co. might wrest away leadership in its niche. So far that hasn’t happened, and United Therapeutics is also developing drugs outside its traditional niche, such as treatments for liver and kidney disease. Its net margin is 40%. Zoom Communications Inc. (ZM) had first-mover advantage in the market for online meetings software. Lately Microsoft Teams and Google Meet have chipped into its market share. Zoom’s growth – spectacular during the pandemic – has flattened out. Nonetheless, Zoom remains a significant player in online meetings, with roughly half the market. Its net profit margin is a fat 25%. The stock, which rose above $500 in 2020, has subsided to $83, and I think it is probably a good buy at the current price. I’ve written 15 columns before this one on stocks with fat profit margins. Results have been mixed and strange, but a little more good than bad. The average 12-month return on my recommendations has been 16.3%. That beats the average return for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return index over the same periods, which was 15.8%. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. The odd thing is that my picks, while profitable 10 times out of 15, have beaten the index only four times. My average return beat the benchmark mainly because of great returns in 2014-2015 (83.2%) and 2020-2021 (78.6%). My picks from a year ago didn’t get traction. They were up only 0.1%, trailing the S&P by 15 percentage points, mostly because of a 37% loss in ON Semiconductor Corp. The best gainer was Snap-on Inc. (SNA), which returned 16.9%. Disclosure: I own Anglogold Ashanti personally and for most of my clients. I own Applied Materials for a few clients.

Today's top news: Friday was a big day for those companies entering the S&P 500. While a major crypto favorite was once again left out. S&P Dow Jones Indices said Robinhood (HOOD) will join the S&P 500 at the upcoming quarterly rebalance, replacing a departing constituent. HOOD shares immediately popped 7% on the news. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy (MSTR), despite checking all the requirement boxes, was not selected this cycle. MSTR’s recent price action certainly isn’t helping its case, down 16% this month while Bitcoin is only down 3%. It’s an exciting milestone to have Robinhood join the storied S&P 500 Index. I’ll share what I told the team today — we don’t stop to celebrate, our single focus remains building exceptional products for our customers. - Vlad Tenev, Robinhood CEO “Do you know which two companies didn’t make it into the S&P 500 last quarter despite meeting all the criteria? AppLovin and Robinhood. They were passed in June and both got in today on their second try. Same story with Uber and Tesla. Be patient. $MSTR will get there” - X user Angarlo First, the reason companies and their shareholders want to join the S&P is clear - huge rebalancing and ongoing inflows. Getting added to the S&P is almost a lock guarantee for near-term stock price increases (barring other macro factors). So it’s a big deal to be added. As for HOOD making it in over MSTR, the decision signals the committee’s preference for platform exposure over asset proxies. Robinhood’s inclusion validates a maturing, retail-first fintech that happens to have crypto in its product mix; it pulls another crypto-adjacent revenue stream directly into America’s most-tracked benchmark without making a call on any single token. By contrast, MicroStrategy’s pass suggests the S&P still wants operating cash flows and business diversification when it chooses members. For investors, the implication is straightforward: if you want crypto exposure inside the index, build a real business that uses it, don’t just warehouse it.

Title: Breaking News in Digital Marketing: Social Media & AI 2025

Time Published: 2025-09-08T03:24:53Z
Full Content:
Here is a look at the breaking news in digital marketing for May 2025. The world of digital marketing is experiencing a seismic shift, and the epicenters are social media and artificial intelligence. As of 2025, these two forces are no longer separate trends but a deeply integrated reality that is rewriting the playbook for brands, advertisers, and consumers alike. From the way you create content to how you connect with your audience, AI is unlocking new efficiencies and capabilities. Are you prepared to adapt your strategy for this new era? The latest breaking news in digital marketing signals a clear and irreversible move toward an AI-first approach. May 2025 has been a landmark month, with industry-shaking announcements that are forcing marketers to rethink their entire marketing strategy. The most significant marketing trends are now directly tied to AI's expanding role in search, advertising, and content discovery. These developments are not on the horizon; they are here now, impacting organic traffic, ad campaign creation, and how brands are perceived online. The following updates explore the critical changes you need to understand to stay competitive. This month, marketing leaders are buzzing about Google's recent announcements, which have profound implications for the industry. The company confirmed a major expansion of its AI Overviews in the U.S., fundamentally altering how search results are presented. This change prioritizes AI-generated summaries, pushing traditional organic listings further down the page and challenging how digital marketers approach SEO. Simultaneously, Google unveiled "AI Max" at its Marketing Live event, an advanced AI-driven platform designed to automate the creation of entire paid search campaigns. While promising efficiency, it raises questions about strategic control and brand consistency. These announcements underscore a critical turning point where leveraging AI is no longer optional for achieving business goals. For many, this signals a need to adapt quickly or risk becoming invisible in a search landscape increasingly curated by algorithms. The focus now shifts to how brands can influence these AI systems to protect their visibility and bottom line. This week's hot topics in digital marketing revolve around adapting to an AI-dominated landscape. Marketers are grappling with significant drops in organic traffic, with some studies showing a 15-30% decrease for informational queries due to AI-driven search summaries. This has ignited a race to find new opportunities for visibility. The conversation is centered on practical strategies for this new reality. Performance marketing experts are particularly focused on how to maintain and improve campaign performance when the rules are changing so rapidly. Key discussions from the last week of May 2025 include: These highlights show a clear trend: marketers are moving from discussing AI's potential to actively developing tactics to manage its real-world impact. The social media trends of 2025 are being profoundly shaped by AI, which is disrupting everything from content discovery to user interaction. AI algorithms are not just personalizing feeds; they are creating entirely new ways for users to engage with brands and each other. This is causing a noticeable shift in user behavior across all major social media platforms. As a result, what worked last year may not be effective today. Brands must now contend with AI-driven features that influence what content gets seen and how conversations unfold. The following sections explore how new platforms are emerging and how brands are adapting to this dynamic environment. New social platforms and AI-integrated features are rapidly changing consumer behavior, especially among Gen Z. This demographic, in particular, is embracing more interactive and autonomous AI-powered experiences. Instead of static search bars, users are turning to conversational AI assistants within apps to get answers, schedule appointments, and even receive product recommendations. This shift is forcing brands to reconsider the type of content they produce and where they publish it. The emphasis is moving toward providing utility and instant support. Some of the key features gaining traction include: U.S. marketers are reacting by investing in chatbot technology and exploring how to integrate their brands into these new conversational interfaces, recognizing that this is the future of digital interaction. To foster stronger connections with customers, brands are leveraging AI to enable real-time engagement like never before. The goal is to move beyond generic messaging and interact with audiences at the right time with the right offer. This means personalizing every touchpoint of the customer journey, from the first ad they see to post-purchase support. One powerful example is TSB Bank, which used real-time data to personalize loan offers based on recent customer activity. This single change led to a 300% increase in mobile loan sales. This demonstrates the immense potential of using AI to analyze behavior as it happens and respond instantly with relevant content. This proactive approach to engagement is becoming the new standard. Brands are adapting by integrating AI tools that can predict customer needs and automate personalized outreach, ensuring that their message is not only seen but also feels uniquely tailored to each individual. Generative AI has officially moved from a niche technology to a cornerstone of modern digital marketing. Its impact is most visible in content generation, where it is unlocking new capabilities for creating copy, images, and even video at an unprecedented scale. This is fundamentally changing the economics and speed of content marketing. However, the rise of generative AI is about more than just efficiency. It's empowering marketers to test creative variations faster, personalize messaging with greater precision, and uncover insights that guide strategy. The following sections will show how this technology is driving both creativity and hyper-personalization across digital channels. Generative AI is revolutionizing content production by acting as a copilot for content creators. Tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Runway are now standard in many marketing departments, helping to accelerate everything from brainstorming initial concepts to producing final assets. This allows teams to iterate on ideas much faster than before. As Ron Friedman, Vice President at Mattel Future Lab, states, "Weâre using generative AI as a copilot for ideation, helping us iterate and validate ideas quickly." This sentiment is echoed across industries. For example, Eric Perez at iHeartMedia notes that in a fast-paced environment, AI is a "game changer" for speeding up concept development without sacrificing quality. This technology is not replacing human creativity but augmenting it. It handles the heavy lifting of initial drafts and visual mockups, freeing up marketers to focus on strategy, brand nuance, and the emotional connection that only a human touch can provide. The result is a more efficient and dynamic content creation process. Achieving true personalization at scale has long been a goal for marketers, and AI is finally making it a reality. By analyzing vast amounts of data in real time, AI enables brands to deliver a superior customer experience by serving highly relevant content across all digital channels, from websites to email to social media. However, a significant gap remains between consumer expectations and brand delivery. An Adobe report found that while 71% of consumers want brands to anticipate their needs, only 34% of brands are successfully doing so. AI-enhanced personalization aims to close this gap by moving from segment-based targeting to one-on-one interactions. As Leo Griffin of HanesBrands Inc. explains, "Personalization helps our consumers feel known." This is the core of the strategy: using AI not just to sell, but to build relationships. Brands like Danish telecom provider Telmore are already seeing results, with their AI-driven personalization efforts delivering an 11% sales lift. May 2025 has seen a surge in new AI tools designed to give marketers a competitive edge. These innovative solutions offer new capabilities for everything from consumer research to ad campaign management. The rapid adoption of AI is being driven by tools that are not only powerful but also increasingly accessible to teams of all sizes. One of the most talked-about launches was Google's AI Max platform, but it is just one of many new technologies entering the market. The following sections highlight some of the other groundbreaking solutions that are helping marketers work smarter and achieve better results. Beyond major platform updates, a range of innovative AI solutions are empowering digital marketers to refine their marketing strategy. These tools are designed to solve specific challenges, from understanding consumer sentiment to optimizing content for search engines. Many are becoming indispensable parts of the modern marketing tech stack. One standout tool is GWI Spark, an AI assistant that provides instant consumer insights from global survey data, allowing marketers to ask questions in natural language and get actionable answers in seconds. This democratizes research and enables faster, more data-driven decision-making. Other key solutions gaining traction include: These tools are not just about automation; they provide strategic insights that help marketers stay ahead of the curve. Major digital advertising platforms are deeply embedding AI into their core offerings, making these AI tools essential for running effective marketing campaigns. These platform integrations are designed to automate and optimize tasks that were once manual, from bidding to creative testing. For marketers, understanding these native tools is just as important as adopting third-party solutions. Google and Meta, for example, have baked AI into nearly every aspect of their advertising products. This helps advertisers improve targeting, generate ad variations, and predict campaign performance with greater accuracy. The goal is to deliver better results with less manual effort, allowing teams to focus more on high-level strategy. Here is a look at some key platform-specific AI integrations as of May 2025: Platform AI Integration/Feature Primary Use Case Google Ads AI Max Generates entire campaigns (headlines, assets, keywords) from a landing page and brand prompts. Google Search AI Overviews Creates AI-generated summaries at the top of search results, changing SEO dynamics. Meta Ads Advantage+ Campaigns Automates audience targeting, ad placement, and creative delivery to maximize performance. GWI GWI Spark An AI research assistant that generates consumer insights from proprietary data on demand. These integrations demonstrate a clear industry trend toward AI-powered automation and optimization within the largest digital ecosystems. Google Marketing Live 2025 was a pivotal event for marketing leaders, with announcements centered on the next evolution of AI in Google Ads. The headline news was the launch of "AI Max," a new platform designed to take Performance Max a step further by using generative AI to build entire campaigns with minimal human input. This development presents both new opportunities and new challenges. While it promises to streamline campaign creation and improve efficiency, it also raises important questions about creative control and strategic oversight. The following sections break down the key innovations revealed at the event. The biggest news in paid search to come out of Google Marketing Live 2025 is AI Max. This platform uses generative AI to build complete campaignsâincluding headlines, descriptions, creative assets, and keyword strategiesâfrom just a landing page URL and a few brand prompts. The goal is to radically simplify the launch of high-performing campaigns and improve overall search performance. Google positions AI Max as a smarter, faster way to achieve results, with predictive insights to guide advertisers. For time-pressed teams, this level of automation could be a significant advantage. It promises to optimize bidding and targeting in ways that are difficult to replicate manually, potentially leading to better visibility in search results. However, advertisers are proceeding with caution. While the efficiency gains are clear, many are wary of handing over complete strategic control to an algorithm. Concerns about brand consistency and the inability to fine-tune campaigns beyond AI Max's suggestions are prevalent. Marketers will need to find a balance between leveraging this powerful automation and maintaining their unique brand voice. The integration with Google Analytics will be crucial for measuring its true impact. While much of the focus at Google Marketing Live was on search, the new AI capabilities also have major implications for display campaigns and social media marketing. The generative AI within platforms like AI Max can create a wide variety of visual assets and ad copy, making it easier for marketers to test different creative approaches across Google's Display Network and YouTube. This allows for the rapid creation of diverse ad campaigns tailored to different audience segments. By automating the generation of images and ad variations, marketers can run more complex tests to see what resonates best with their audience, ultimately improving campaign performance without a proportional increase in creative workload. These enhancements are designed to make cross-channel advertising more cohesive and efficient. The ability to generate assets for display and video alongside search ads from a single set of prompts streamlines the entire campaign creation process. It empowers marketers to maintain a consistent brand message while optimizing performance on every platform. The theoretical benefits of generative AI are compelling, but what do they look like in practice? A growing number of case studies are demonstrating how this technology is driving better results and transforming campaign performance across various industries. These real-world examples show that AI is not just a buzzword but a practical tool for achieving tangible business outcomes. From social media to video content, brands are finding innovative ways to apply AI for higher engagement and greater efficiency. The following examples highlight some of the most successful digital campaigns powered by AI as of May 2025. While specific case studies for May 2025 are just emerging, we can look at how leading brands are applying AI principles to their social media platforms. A notable example involves a global consumer goods brand, similar to L'OrÃ©al or NestlÃ©, that utilized AI tools to overhaul its social media marketing campaigns. The goal was to increase relevance among a younger demographic. The brand used a generative AI platform to create hundreds of visual variations for its ads, each tailored to different audience micro-segments identified by a predictive analytics tool. This allowed them to move beyond broad demographic targeting and speak to individual interests and behaviors. The AI also monitored social media sentiment in real time, allowing the marketing team to adjust messaging on the fly. The results were impressive. The campaign saw a significant lift in key metrics, achieving higher engagement rates and a lower cost per acquisition compared to previous, less-personalized efforts. This success demonstrates how combining generative AI for content with predictive AI for targeting can create a powerful and effective social media strategy. AI is significantly accelerating the production of video content and other forms of creative content. In today's fast-paced content marketing environment, the demand for fresh, engaging visuals is relentless. Generative AI tools like Runway are enabling marketing teams to meet this demand by automating parts of the video creation process, from generating initial storyboards to producing short-form video clips for social media. This technology is not about creating feature films but about streamlining the content generation workflow for marketing campaigns. For instance, a brand can use AI to quickly create multiple versions of a product promo video, each with different background music, text overlays, and calls to action. This allows for rapid A/B testing to determine which version performs best with a target audience. This approach frees up creative teams from repetitive editing tasks, allowing them to focus on higher-level concepts and storytelling. By integrating AI into their creative strategies, brands can produce more content, test more ideas, and ultimately deliver more effective campaigns without burning out their creative resources. The impact of AI on website design and optimization is transformative. AI is enabling a shift from static, one-size-fits-all websites to dynamic, personalized digital experiences. This technology is also reshaping SEO strategies, as marketers must now optimize for both traditional search engine crawlers and the AI algorithms that power generative search results. Are you using AI to its full potential on your website? The following sections explore how AI can create deeply personalized user journeys and dramatically improve conversion rates, turning your website into a more intelligent and effective marketing tool. Creating a truly personalized user experience is a top priority for digital marketers, and AI tools are making it possible. Instead of showing every visitor the same homepage, AI can dynamically alter content, product recommendations, and messaging based on a user's past behavior, location, and other data points. This creates a much more relevant and engaging customer experience. For example, an e-commerce site can use AI to showcase products that a specific user is likely to be interested in, based on their browsing history. A B2B website might highlight case studies from the visitor's industry. This level of personalization makes visitors feel understood and valued, which can significantly increase engagement and loyalty. Vanguard provides a powerful example of this in action. By using technology to deliver updated, personalized content, the company saw a 176% increase in quality engagement on its new website. This shows that when personalization is done right, the results can be dramatic. Improving conversion rates is a core goal of any digital marketing strategy, and new AI tools are providing powerful new levers for optimization. These tools go beyond traditional A/B testing by using machine learning to analyze user behavior, identify friction points in the customer journey, and automatically test thousands of design and copy variations. For example, an AI tool can analyze session recordings to identify where users are dropping off in the checkout process. It could then suggest and automatically implement changes to the user interface to make the process smoother. This allows for continuous, data-driven optimization that would be impossible to manage manually. This AI-powered approach to conversion rate optimization (CRO) is gaining popularity because it delivers measurable results. By constantly learning and adapting, these tools can significantly lift conversion rates over time. This frees up marketers to focus on the overall strategy while the AI handles the granular details of on-page optimization. AI-powered advertising is quickly becoming the new standard in digital advertising. These strategies use AI to optimize every aspect of a campaign, from identifying the ideal target audience to allocating marketing budgets in real time. This data-driven approach allows for a level of precision and efficiency that was previously unattainable. Marketers are embracing these strategies because they deliver better performance and a higher return on investment. The following sections explore two of the most popular AI-powered tactics gaining traction in May 2025: hyper-targeting and automated ad creation. One of the most powerful applications of AI in advertising is hyper-targeting, which is made possible by dynamic audience segmentation. Instead of creating broad audience buckets, AI can analyze thousands of data signals in real time to group users into highly specific micro-segments based on their current behavior and predicted intent. This process relies heavily on predictive analytics. AI models can forecast which users are most likely to convert, allowing advertisers to focus their ad spend on the most promising prospects. This provides valuable insights into customer behavior and helps ensure that ad messages are delivered only to those who will find them most relevant. For example, an online retailer could use AI to identify a segment of users who have recently searched for a specific product, visited a competitor's website, and shown a high likelihood of making a purchase in the next 24 hours. This level of precision makes ad campaigns dramatically more effective and reduces wasted ad spend. The automation of ad creation and performance monitoring is freeing up marketing teams from tedious, time-consuming tasks. With AI tools like Google's AI Max, marketers can now generate hundreds of ad variationsâincluding text, images, and headlinesâin a matter of minutes. This allows for more extensive testing and optimization than ever before. Once campaigns are live, AI continues to play a crucial role in performance monitoring. AI systems can track key metrics in real time, identify underperforming ads, and automatically reallocate budget to the best-performing creative. Some advanced systems can even create new ad variations on the fly based on what's currently resonating with the audience. This level of automation empowers marketing teams to operate at a much larger scale and with greater agility. It allows them to move away from manual campaign management and focus on strategic planning, creative direction, and analyzing the high-level insights that the AI provides. AI is revolutionizing analytics and reporting by making data analysis happen in real time. Instead of waiting for weekly or monthly reports, marketers can now get instant insights into campaign performance. This is particularly valuable for performance marketing, where quick adjustments can have a significant impact on results. These AI innovations are turning data into a strategic asset that can be used to make faster, smarter decisions. The following sections explore how AI is enabling predictive insights and helping brands detect trends and manage crises more effectively. How could your team benefit from instant access to these insights? Predictive analytics is one of the most transformative applications of AI for marketers. By analyzing historical data and real-time trends, AI models can forecast future outcomes, such as which customer segments are likely to grow or which marketing channels will deliver the best ROI. These valuable insights empower marketers to make proactive, data-driven marketing decisions. According to a 2025 Adobe report, leveraging AI and predictive analytics is a top priority for 65% of senior executives aiming for growth. This is because these technologies provide a forward-looking view that helps guide everything from budget allocation to product development. Instead of reacting to past performance, teams can now anticipate market shifts and consumer needs before they even happen. This allows them to allocate resources more effectively and design marketing efforts that are positioned for future success, giving them a significant competitive advantage. In today's fast-moving digital world, real-time trend detection and rapid crisis response are essential. AI tools are becoming indispensable for this, as they can monitor millions of conversations on social media and other online platforms to identify emerging trends and potential PR crises before they escalate. By analyzing sentiment, volume, and the context of online mentions, AI can alert marketing teams to a sudden spike in negative comments or a new meme format that is going viral. This gives brands the ability to respond quickly and appropriately. For trend detection, AI can spot shifts in consumer interests, helping brands create relevant content that taps into the cultural zeitgeist. Digital marketing professionals have reacted to the AI updates in May 2025 with a mix of excitement and urgency. They see the potential of these tools for proactive brand management but also recognize the need to develop new workflows to leverage these real-time insights effectively. The rapid adoption of AI is reshaping the digital marketing skills required to succeed in the modern job market. The most valuable members of marketing teams are no longer just specialists in a single channel but professionals who possess a strong degree of AI literacy. They understand how to work alongside AI to achieve better results. This shift is creating new roles and evolving existing ones. The following sections outline the essential skills that digital marketers need to cultivate in 2025 and discuss the importance of training and upskilling to keep pace with technological change. To maintain a competitive advantage, digital marketers must cultivate a new set of must-have skills centered around human-AI collaboration. Marketers who know how to effectively use AI will have a significant edge over those who do not. This isn't about becoming a data scientist; it's about understanding how to leverage AI tools to enhance marketing strategy and execution. These skills enable marketers to guide AI systems, interpret their outputs, and ensure that all automated efforts align with brand goals. The most successful marketing teams will be those that blend technical proficiency with strategic and creative thinking. Key skills for 2025 include: Developing AI literacy across marketing teams is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Forward-thinking organizations are proactively investing in training programs to upskill their employees, ensuring they are comfortable and proficient with the new generation of AI tools. This is crucial for successful AI adoption and for maintaining a competitive edge. These training initiatives range from internal workshops and bootcamps to hands-on sessions with the specific AI tools being used every day. The goal is not to turn every marketer into an AI expert but to build a baseline level of understanding and confidence. When teams feel empowered to use AI, they are more likely to find innovative ways to apply it to their work. Ultimately, the objective is to make AI feel like a natural part of the marketing workflowâa powerful assistant that helps teams work smarter, not a complex technology to be feared. This investment in human capital is just as important as the investment in the technology itself. As AI marketing becomes more powerful, the issues of data privacy, ethics, and trust move to the forefront. Effective personalization relies on data, but consumers are increasingly concerned about how their information is being used. Building and maintaining trust is non-negotiable for long-term success. Striking the right balance between delivering personalized experiences and ensuring robust consumer data protection is a critical challenge. The following sections explore how marketers can navigate this complex landscape by addressing issues like bias and transparency. The central challenge in modern marketing is balancing effective personalization with the non-negotiable need for consumer data protection. While consumers want brands to anticipate their needs, they are also highly concerned about data privacy. This creates a significant trust gap that brands must bridge. According to a 2025 Adobe report, a staggering 88% of consumers believe it's important for brands to handle their data responsibly, yet only 49% of organizations are perceived as meeting this expectation. This gap undermines the very foundation of personalization, as customers will not willingly share data with brands they do not trust. To navigate this, marketers must be transparent about how they collect and use data. This means providing clear privacy policies, giving users control over their information, and ensuring that all data is handled securely. Building trust is not just a legal requirement; it is a strategic imperative for any brand that wants to build lasting customer relationships. A critical aspect of ethical AI involves addressing algorithmic bias and ensuring transparency. AI tools are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on. If the training data contains historical biases, the AI's outputâwhether it's ad targeting or content generationâwill perpetuate and even amplify those biases. This can lead to skewed campaigns and significant reputational damage. Marketers must be vigilant and question the outputs of their AI tools. It's crucial to understand where the data is coming from and to regularly review campaigns for any signs of unfair bias. This requires a commitment to ethics that goes beyond simple compliance. Furthermore, the question of transparency with consumers is becoming more pressing. Should audiences be informed when content is AI-generated? While standards are still evolving, a move toward greater transparency is essential for building long-term trust. Being open about the use of AI can help manage customer expectations and reinforce a brand's commitment to ethical practices. While the benefits of AI are clear, there are several AI challenges that can slow down digital marketing adoption. These hurdles are often not just technological but also organizational. Issues like integrating AI with legacy technology and managing the human side of change are common roadblocks for many companies. Successfully overcoming these challenges requires a strategic approach that focuses on both systems and people. The following sections explore how to tackle integration issues and foster effective human-AI collaboration to ensure a smooth and successful transition. One of the most significant practical hurdles in AI adoption is the integration of AI tools with existing legacy technology. Many organizations, from large enterprises to small businesses, operate on a patchwork of older systems, such as CRMs, CDPs, and analytics platforms. These fragmented systems often create data silos that prevent AI from working effectively. According to a 2025 Adobe report, 32% of organizations point to fragmented IT systems as a key barrier to progress. Attempting to layer sophisticated AI applications on top of a disconnected data foundation often leads to disappointing results. The AI can't access the real-time, unified data it needs to deliver true personalization. To overcome this, organizations must prioritize data unification. This doesn't always mean ripping and replacing old systems. Instead, it can involve investing in platforms that are built for interoperability and can connect disparate data sources. A clear data strategy is the essential first step to unlocking the full potential of AI in digital marketing. While AI promises efficiency, its implementation can sometimes lead to AI fatigue among marketing teams. The pressure to adopt new tools, learn new skills, and manage AI-generated outputs can add strain to existing workflows. A recent study found that 56% of marketing and CX teams report that implementing generative AI creates extra work. The key to avoiding this burnout is to foster a healthy model of human-AI collaboration. This means clearly defining roles: AI handles the heavy liftingâdata analysis, content generation, task automationâwhile humans provide strategic direction, creative judgment, and ethical oversight. This partnership allows teams to benefit from AI's speed and scale without being overwhelmed by it. This collaborative approach is crucial in areas like customer support, where AI chatbots can handle routine inquiries, freeing up human agents to manage more complex and emotionally nuanced issues. By framing AI as a supportive partner rather than a replacement, organizations can build a more sustainable and effective marketing operation. A number of pioneering US brands are already demonstrating the power of AI-driven marketing. Their successes offer valuable case studies and a blueprint for other organizations looking to leverage AI. These companies are moving beyond pilot programs and are embedding AI into their core strategies, leading to measurable improvements in campaign performance. From retail to finance to media, these early adopters are showcasing what's possible when technology is combined with a clear vision. The following examples highlight some of the key learnings and impressive results from these industry leaders. The enterprise adoption of AI is providing powerful case studies and practical learnings for the entire industry. These examples show how large organizations are using AI to solve real-world business problems and unlock new opportunities for growth. A key learning is that success often starts with a specific, well-defined problem. Rather than attempting a massive, all-encompassing AI transformation, leading companies are focusing on high-impact use cases first. This allows them to demonstrate ROI quickly and build momentum for broader adoption. Here are a few examples of how US brands are successfully using AI: The success of AI in marketing is ultimately measured by its impact on the bottom line. The most compelling metrics from May 2025 go beyond vanity numbers and demonstrate tangible business results. These figures provide valuable insights into how AI is improving campaign performance and driving revenue growth. One of the most striking results comes from TSB Bank. By using real-time data to personalize loan offers, the bank increased its mobile loan sales by an incredible 300%. This metric directly ties an AI-driven strategy to a significant increase in sales, showcasing a clear return on investment. Similarly, Danish telecom provider Telmore reported an 11% sales lift from its AI-driven personalization efforts compared to non-personalized experiences. At Vanguard, a focus on personalized web content led to a 176% increase in quality engagement. These are the metrics that matterâthe ones that prove AI is not just a cost center but a powerful engine for growth. Looking ahead, the future outlook for digital marketing is one of ever-deepening AI collaboration. The synergy between social media and AI will continue to evolve, creating new opportunities for brands to connect with audiences in more meaningful and efficient ways. The era of proactive, predictive marketing is just beginning. This next phase will move beyond simple automation to more autonomous systems that can anticipate consumer needs and orchestrate complex customer journeys. What emerging trends should you be preparing for as we head into the second half of 2025? As we look toward the end of the year and into the next year, one of the most significant emerging trends is the rise of "agentic AI." This represents the next evolution of virtual assistants. Instead of just responding to commands, agentic AI systems will be autonomous agents that can take initiative on behalf of the user. Imagine a shopping assistant on a social media app that doesn't just recommend products but, with permission, proactively adds items to a cart based on your style preferences and upcoming events. Or a travel assistant that not only finds flights but also books them, arranges transportation, and suggests itineraries. This is the promise of agentic AI: a concierge-like experience that offers unparalleled convenience and personalization. This shift will move marketing from being reactive to truly proactive, where brands can anticipate and fulfill customer needs before they are even explicitly stated. For marketers, the challenge will be to build the trust and data infrastructure required to power these advanced, autonomous experiences. Increasingly sophisticated consumer expectations demand that marketing teams align their strategies with the dynamic landscape of digital behaviors. Gen Z, for instance, seeks authentic engagement across social media platforms, showcasing the importance of crafting relevant content that resonates with younger audiences. As real-time data analysis becomes more prevalent, businesses utilizing predictive analytics can better refine their marketing campaigns. The incorporation of AI tools also allows for personalized product recommendations and customer service enhancement, fostering stronger connections and ultimately improving conversion rates. This shift not only reshapes customer journeys but also presents new opportunities for marketing leaders to achieve their business goals.

Focusing on the customer journey is crucial; personalized content and refined email marketing strategies can significantly enhance performance metrics. Embracing these trends will empower businesses to create stronger connections with their target audience, ultimately driving conversions and maximizing the bottom line. In 2025, key AI updates in digital marketing included advanced predictive analytics for consumer insights, enhanced personalization through machine learning algorithms, and automated content generation tools. These innovations significantly improved targeting strategies and customer engagement, aligning with evolving consumer expectations and behaviors. Marketers are adapting to rapid changes in social media and AI by embracing innovative strategies, enhancing customer interaction through personalized content, and leveraging data analytics. This proactive approach helps them stay relevant, meet evolving consumer expectations, and drive engagement effectively. Brands should explore AI-powered tools like chatbots for customer support, sentiment analysis for engagement insights, and content generation platforms to streamline marketing efforts. These tools not only enhance customer experiences but also improve operational efficiency in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. â

ByForbes Asia Team, Forbes Staff. When Forbes Asia launched in September 2005, it marked the start of a dedicated focus on, as we then described it, the world’s most economically dynamic region. Over the past two decades our network of reporters and editors has documented the titans and companies forming the backbone of Asia’s economies and creating the wealth that has underpinned regional growth. We’ve journeyed with our readers through China’s prosperity boom and slowdown, India’s transformation under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ASEAN’s trade and economic expansion, the fallout of the 2008 global financial crisis, and, most recently, the aftermath of the Covid-19 epidemic. As the trusted chronicler of wealth, we’ve tracked the explosion in the number of billionaires in this region. There were 115 Asians worth a collective $364 billion on our World’s Billionaires list of 2006. This tally has since soared. In the 2025 rankings, there were a total of 1,046 billionaires from the Asia-Pacific, collectively worth $4.2 trillion. China (including Hong Kong) and India had the second- and third-largest number of billionaires in the world after the U.S., with 516 and 205, respectively. Our dozen country rich lists, where the typical minimum net worth requirement of $1 billion does not apply, cast a wider net, though in China and India that sum is no longer enough to earn a berth among their 100 richest. We drilled deeper to uncover top-performing businesses (and future billionaires) through our annual Best Under A Billion list, which highlights 200 publicly listed small and midsized companies with sales below $1 billion. In 2012 we kicked off an annual roster to celebrate the growing presence of Asia’s power businesswomen. And 2016 saw the debut of a regional 30 Under 30 list to foreground young achievers, including entrepreneurs, artists and athletes. Our 100 to Watch list of small companies and startups on the rise was launched five years ago. The accompanying pages showcase many of the moguls featured on our covers over the past 20 years whose achievements have contributed to planting Asia firmly on the global economic map. Edited by Mary E. Scott We shadowed India-born, U.S.-based venture capitalist Promod Haque of Norwest Venture Partners as he crisscrossed his homeland searching for high-tech gold. In his 35-year career, Haque rolled the dice on some 70 companies, roughly 10% in India, with a combined exit value of $40 billion. That put him on the Forbes Midas List of top VCs more than a dozen times. Now in a part-time role at Norwest, the 77-year-old still believes India provides ample “opportunity for great investment success.” This compendium of Asia-Pacific’s 200 top-performing small and midsized companies with annual revenue under $1 billion often has titans in the making. Notable alumni of the Best Under A Billion list over the years range from China’s Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent to Malaysia’s AirAsia and the Philippines’ Jollibee to India’s Infosys and Biocon. We highlighted Singapore Airlines in the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, when it posted profits amid high fuel prices and a threat from Dubai-based Emirates. It has since won accolades as one of the world’s best carriers. In 2024, we revisited the airline after it had scooped up a 25% stake in the privatized Air India, partnering with the Tata conglomerate. Net profit hit a record $2.8 billion in the year to March 31, though the Air India bet has yet to pay off. U.S.-educated brothers Victor and William Fung were named our 2006 businessmen of the year for converting their family company, Li & Fung, into a world-class enterprise connecting American and European consumers to factories in 40 countries. While they still retain significant stakes, Victor’s son Spencer is now group executive chairman. In 2020, the family partnered with Singapore logistics firm GLP to take Li & Fung private, delisting it from the Hong Kong stock exchange after a 28-year run. Korean skincare and cosmetics maker Amorepacific drew our attention long before the K-beauty phenomenon exploded, with products now routinely flogged by influencers on social media. In 2015, we named its billionaire chairman and CEO, Suh Kyung-bae, grandson of the founder, as businessman of the year. Today, as Americans panic buy their favorite K-beauty brands before the Trump tariffs hit, the company’s $3 billion in annual revenue looks set to get a lift. Nandan Nilekani was facing a problem at Infosys, the software company he cofounded: hiring 28,500 people in one year. In today’s AI world, the Indian IT behemoth has reportedly slowed recruitment. More than 80% of the 324,000 people it employs—up fivefold since 2006—are tagged “AI aware.” Nilekani left Infosys in 2009 to work with the government to build Aadhaar, India’s mammoth identity card scheme. A boardroom shake-up eight years later brought him back to Infosys as chairman. We profiled Li Ka-shing, nicknamed Superman, who at the time was the richest man in Asia and running his telecom-to-ports empire with an eye on China expansion. Today the 97-year-old’s CK Hutchison, from which he retired as chairman but remains as senior advisor, is in the throes of a complex $23 billion deal to sell its port assets, including two at the Panama Canal, which is strategically important to both the Americans and Chinese. The possible buyer is a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock and, potentially, state-owned China Cosco Shipping. Li, who got his start making plastic flowers, is now among Asia’s richest with a $40 billion fortune. Vaccine billionaire Cyrus Poonawalla, founder of privately held Serum Institute of India, was the face of our 2007 list of 50 richest Indians. By 2014, the roster had expanded to 100 and each had to be worth at least $1 billion to qualify. In 2020, when the pandemic shut down the world, Poonawalla’s son Adar stepped up to produce a Covid-19 vaccine licensed from AstraZeneca. Last year was a record breaker for the list: the combined wealth of India’s 100 richest surpassed $1 trillion for the first time. When we met with Edwin Soeryadjaya, he was dead set on restoring the family fortune, wiped out when his father sold a stake in automotive group Astra to bail out a bank that was run by another son. Soeryadjaya rebuilt the clan’s wealth largely through a stake in coal miner Adaro. Lately he’s been greening his portfolio with solar and carbon-offset investments. Nvidia was named company of the year when the California-based chipmaker’s graphics processors were revolutionizing how we watched TV, gamed and used the internet. Today, the company is making a bigger killing as the supplier of the world’s most powerful AI chips, propelling its market cap to over $4 trillion. Founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s wealth has ballooned to $157 billion, making him the world’s seventh-richest person. In 2020, Hong Kong billionaire Francis Choi put his money behind biodegradable plastics to make environmentally friendly toys. This was a break from 2007, when Choi’s Early Light Industrial’s China-made toys for Mattel were found to contain lead paint. The “King of Toys” now has broader interests, from property to luxury watch retailing. Unfazed by the global financial crisis, brandy billionaire Andrew Tan teamed up with Malaysian gaming tycoon Lim Kok Thay’s Genting to invest $1.6 billion in building two casino resorts to make Manila the next Monte Carlo. While the partnership ended in 2023, it was a smart bet for Tan. Last year, the Philippines hit a record $7 billion in gross gaming revenue, higher than Singapore’s estimated $6 billion but dwarfed by the $27 billion for Macau, still the world’s top gambling city. Just months after featuring on our cover, William Amelio stepped down as CEO of Lenovo after a four-year stint; Yang Yuanqing—who in 2004 transformed Lenovo into a global tech player by buying IBM’s PC business for over $1 billion—was reinstated in his place, and founder Liu Chuanzi returned as chairman. The leadership overhaul came after sales plunged and the company slid into the red. Today, Lenovo is the world’s No. 1 PC maker in unit terms, up from No. 4 in 2008. Yang is CEO, chairman, and a billionaire. Liu is honorary chairman. Tadashi Yanai’s goal was to have more people wear his threads than those made by rivals Gap, H&M and Zara owner Inditex. He has since nearly tripled Uniqlo’s store network to some 2,500 outlets worldwide. Based on its $21 billion revenue for fiscal 2024, Yanai’s Fast Retailing has trounced Gap, is closing in on H&M, but has still to catch up with Inditex. Yanai, who became Japan’s richest person in 2009 and is now worth $45 billion, has said that he spends the bulk of his time mentoring potential successors. Our World’s Billionaires List saw a wealth meltdown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and India’s Gautam Adani was no exception. We met the commodities-and-infrastructure tycoon three months after he’d narrowly survived a terror attack by gunmen in a Mumbai hotel. Atop a shipping container at his Mundra port, Adani posed gamely for our photographer. He went on to greater heights, briefly surpassing the likes of Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and fellow Indian Mukesh Ambani in 2022 to become the world’s second-richest person, worth $143 billion. Months later, that went into freefall when U.S. firm Hindenburg Research accused Adani and his companies of financial fraud and stock market manipulation, allegations the businessman denied. His wealth has climbed again since, though not to the same stratospheric level. One year after we profiled Baidu cofounder and CEO Robin Li, Google quit China amid a cyberattack and concerns about censorship, clearing the way for Baidu to become the mainland’s top search engine. The homegrown internet giant has waded into cloud computing and is investing heavily in AI with a ChatGPT-like service called Ernie. Australian trucking billionaire Lindsay Fox declared that the global economic downturn had delivered a record year for his privately owned Linfox, a mover of goods across Asia-Pacific: “Everyone’s eating more at home, everyone’s drinking, and everybody who’s a miner is digging.” A decade later, Covid-19 was a mixed bag. Linfox snagged a government contract to transport tens of millions of vaccines but profits were hit by higher supply chain costs. Fox, 88, has handed running of the business to son and executive chairman Peter. Quitting his career as a banker, Singapore’s Simon Cheong plunged into property development, founding SC Global in 1996 to build ultra-luxury properties, well before the influx of the wealthy from overseas turned into a flood. Known for his meticulous attention to detail, Cheong set a then-record with the Marq, where a four-bedroom unit fetched $16 million in 2011. Tony Fernandes single-handedly made air travel affordable for millions of people when he relaunched AirAsia as a no-frills carrier in 2001. The journey’s been bumpy at times, but the former music industry executive is still flying high as CEO of Capital A, the holding company for the Malaysia-based airline. Charles Chao, CEO of news and entertainment portal Sina, launched microblog Weibo just as Twitter (now X) and Facebook (now Meta) were banned in China. Weibo took off, becoming a forum for popular opinion since surging to 600 million active monthly users. But its Nasdaq-listed shares are down about 90% from a high of $142 in 2018, battered by a massive data breach in 2020 and a weak advertising market. Our reporter tagged along with Jackie Chan as he raced around Asia combining his job as an action movie celebrity with charitable works, which put him on our annual Heroes of Philanthropy list. His Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation, launched in 1988, offers scholarships to students as well as medical services and aid during natural disasters. In 2004, he kicked off his Dragon’s Heart Foundation to build schools and help the elderly in remote parts of mainland China. Chan has said he plans to give his estimated $400 million fortune to charity when he dies. Thailand’s richest person, Dhanin Chearavanont, was then busy hatching a plan for his Charoen Pokphand group, an early mover in China, to build megafarms to feed the country’s growing middle class. In 2024, the group’s Bangkok-listed CP Foods unit drew two-thirds of its $18 billion revenue from overseas. Dhanin stepped back from running his agribusiness-to-telecoms conglomerate in 2017, handing charge to his two sons, though he remains senior chairman. Teresita Sy-Coson was the cover star for our inaugural Asia’s Power Businesswomen list. More than a decade later she remains at the top of the Sy family’s SM Investments holding company, building on the vision of her father, founder Henry Sy, who died in 2019. In the 20 years since listing on the Philippine Stock Exchange, the retail, banking and property conglomerate has seen its shares soar almost sevenfold. Vincent Tan brought McDonald’s to Malaysia, laying the foundation for Berjaya, a retail, property and financial services group that made him one of the country’s richest people. But in 2012, on turning 60, Tan took a back seat to embark on a new mission, helping ordinary Malaysians speak better English. Tan returned as Berjaya’s executive chairman five years later, moving into an advisory role in 2023. He reportedly plans to donate half his estimated $800 million fortune to charity. At the time, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), founded by Morris Chang in 1987, was growing fast, driven by surging demand for its chips for smartphones and tablets. Today, the AI boom is fueling sales at one of the world’s largest chipmakers, with Apple and Nvidia among its biggest customers. With substantial investments in the U.S., TSMC is likely to be exempted from Trump’s tariffs. Chang, 94, who has long since retired, was named by Forbes in 2017 as one of the 100 Greatest Living Business Minds. Peter Woo, one of Hong Kong’s ten richest people, spoke to us at a time when Hong Kongers were complaining about the influx of mainland Chinese visitors. The owner of two flagship shopping malls, whose wealth had doubled in a year to $8 billion thanks to the shopping frenzy, was more welcoming. Two years later, Woo handed charge of his holding company, Wheelock, to son Douglas. We outed Pham Nhat Vuong, founder and chairman of Vingroup, one of Vietnam’s largest conglomerates, as the country’s first billionaire. The self-made Vuong, now worth around $13 billion and the country’s richest person, has been on an expansion binge since, muscling into everything from EVs to renewable energy and hotels. In June, Vingroup revealed plans to build a $14 billion port-and-logistics hub outside Hanoi, where it is based. The founder and executive chairperson of Biocon, which made her the richest self-made woman in India when it went public in 2004, has poured her energy and resources into making a range of low-cost drugs, including for chronic diseases. After losing a friend to cancer, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw set up a cancer center in Bangalore as well as centers for advanced therapeutics and research. Shaw, now 72, whose late husband, John, was also a cancer patient, has pledged to leave 75% of her $3.3 billion wealth to charity. Chew Gek Khim wrested control of Singapore’s Straits Trading in 2008 after a high-profile bidding war with OCBC’s Lee family. Then she got busy revamping the staid colonial-era tin smelter into a sleek 21st-century holding company, broadening its activities to include property, hospitality and asset management. Known for her signature cheongsams, Chew still runs the show as executive chairman. Neil Shen cofounded Sequoia Capital China in 2005, at a time when Chinese internet companies were way behind their American counterparts, and turned it into an investment juggernaut. The key, disclosed the China-born, Yale-educated Shen, was to understand Chinese culture and business practices. Sequoia Capital China was split from its Silicon Valley parent in 2024 and renamed HongShan Capital Group, or HSG, where Shen is founder and managing partner. The billionaire investor has been on our Midas list more than a dozen times. Piyush Gupta retired as CEO of Singapore’s DBS in March, more than a decade after he shared with us his plan to turn the stodgy local bank into a nimble regional player by digitalizing its services. The bank has been named the world’s best digital bank several times and continues to harness cutting-edge technology such as blockchain and AI. Gupta handed charge to DBS veteran Tan Su Shan, who earned a place on our Asia’s Power Businesswomen list in 2024. Lei Jun, founder, chairman and CEO of China’s Xiaomi, which made smartphones affordable for hundreds of millions of people, was a shoo-in for our businessman of the year. Xiaomi, which means “small rice” in Mandarin, was founded in 2010. Since our sit-down with Lei, it has expanded its portfolio to include wearables, IoT devices and more recently, EVs. Lei’s $42 billion fortune makes him China’s sixth-richest person today. This issue was largely dedicated to Singapore’s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, who died March 23, 2015. Remembered by Steve Forbes and others as one of the great statesmen of the post-WWII era, LKY was a clear-eyed pragmatist with superb political skills who built Singapore into the economic powerhouse it is today. LKY also shared his views with our readers as a Forbes columnist for 15 years, starting in 2001. The then-34-year-old Frank Wang was the world’s first drone billionaire, having amassed a fortune with DJI, the company he founded in 2006 and ran out of his dorm room at a Hong Kong university. Today, Shenzhen-based DJI continues to dominate the consumer-drone space, giving Wang a net worth of $5.4 billion. Nepal’s first, and only, billionaire, Binod Chaudhary, raced to the rescue when a 7.8 Richter-scale earthquake devastated the country, distributing essentials in the immediate aftermath, including his company’s Wai Wai instant noodles, and helping longer term with rebuilding. His Chaudhary Foundation, the philanthropic arm of his CG Corp Global conglomerate, was set up in 1995 to support education, disaster management and healthcare, particularly for children. The year marked our first 30 Under 30 Asia list of the Millennials making good in this part of the world. Ten editions later, the roster continues to showcase young entrepreneurs, innovators and artists who are disrupting their chosen fields; only now, Gen Z is taking over, with nearly half of the 2025 cohort aged 27 or under. We flagged Nita Ambani, wife of Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, as the first lady of Indian business and an Asian power businesswoman. At the time, she was a Reliance director, overseeing the launch and branding of telecoms arm Jio, which now has almost 500 million subscribers. Though she retired from the board in 2023 as her children stepped up, she remains chairperson of philanthropic arm Reliance Foundation and is even more visible today. Nita shows up at Premier League cricket matches, rooting for Reliance’s Mumbai Indians team. As a member of the International Olympic Committee, she’s lobbying for the Games to be held in India. A prominent cultural and convention center in Mumbai that was her brainchild bears her name. Hary Tanoesoedibjo, founder and executive chairman of Media Nusantara Citra group, is sometimes called Indonesia’s Donald Trump. Hary (as local media call him) built a fortune in real estate and TV broadcasting and likes to post on social media. He also happens to be the U.S. president’s business partner, owning several Trump-branded resorts in Indonesia. Hary attended the 2017 presidential inauguration and was hobnobbing in Washington D.C. when Trump was sworn in for his second term. He had ambitions to become Indonesia’s president but gave control of the political party he founded to daughter Angela last year. Sonia Cheng grew up in hotels owned by New World Development, a property company founded by her grandfather, Cheng Yu-tung. Under her guidance as CEO, its Rosewood Hotels brand, acquired in 2011, was quickly becoming one of the world’s fastest-growing upscale hotel chains. It now manages 33 properties, including The Carlyle in New York and Hotel de Crillon in Paris, with 27 more being developed. In 2022 Cheng also took on the role of co-vice chairman at Chow Tai Fook Jewellery, the Cheng family’s crown jewel. Meanwhile, New World has been weighed down lately by debt. What was only a dream in 2017 is now reality: Wang Chuanfu’s BYD is the largest EV maker in the world in terms of auto sales. The company’s 2024 revenue exceeded $100 billion, blowing past chief rival Tesla. However, BYD’s shares are off the all-time high they hit in May as investors worry about an EV price war. Joseph Tsai, cofounder and then-executive vice chairman of e-commerce giant Alibaba, had a slam-dunk year in 2017. Of note: his high-profile acquisition of 49% of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team for $1 billion. Three years later, the sports fan paid nearly $1.4 billion for the remaining stake. (He has since sold part of his holding but maintains control.) Tsai rose to chairman of Alibaba in 2023 and is now worth $11.5 billion. We were among the first to spot standout executive Jane Jie Sun, CEO of Trip.com Group (formerly Ctrip). She was in the midst of transforming the China-based online travel agency into a global player that today offers the gamut, from flights and hotels to rail travel and rental cars anywhere in the world. Sun still runs the company—and marathons. Referred to by his staff as “big brother Zhang,” the high school dropout became the world’s richest eatery entrepreneur after listing his Sichuan hot pot chain, Haidilao, in 2018. The business, which Zhang Yong cofounded with his wife, Shu Ping, is not quite sizzling these days. A consumer spending slump in mainland China prompted Zhang, now a Singapore citizen and resident, to diversify into other dining options as well as focus on U.S. expansion. In an exclusive interview, Eduardo Saverin, cofounder of Facebook, explained the investment mantra of B Capital Group, the venture capital firm he established with business partner Raj Ganguly. The duo, based in Singapore and Los Angeles, respectively, were out to prove that innovation can happen anywhere, not just in Silicon Valley. It certainly has. B Capital’s assets under management now stand at $8 billion, invested in more than 190 companies in sectors such as healthcare and AI. Once China’s richest person, beverage billionaire Zong Qinghou talked candidly of his efforts to rekindle sales at his privately held Hangzhou Wahaha Group with its portfolio of bottled water and milk drinks. He also spoke about his daughter, Kelly, as a potential successor. A year after Zong’s death in 2024, Kelly, who now leads Wahaha, is embroiled in an inheritance fight with three people who claim to be the late Zong’s offspring. In the year 2000, Forbes Global (the forerunner of Forbes Asia) put Jack Ma, cofounder of China’s Alibaba, on its cover when the e-commerce company had just 150 employees (vs 124,000 today). Almost two decades later, as Ma stepped down as chairman, announcing that he was switching his focus to philanthropy, he graced the cover again. The former teacher’s meteoric rise as one of China's top tech entrepreneurs earned him the Malcolm S. Forbes Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019. Martin and Peter Lee, the sons of Lee Shau Kee, then Hong Kong’s richest person, had spent less than a year as co-chairmen at the family’s property flagship, Henderson Land, when they agreed to open up about how they planned to carry the legacy forward. The patriarch’s death in March 2025 makes them co-owners of one of Hong Kong’s largest landlords at a time when the property market is in a prolonged slump. In 2020, Masayoshi Son, founder of Japanese investment giant SoftBank, had hit a wall. Some big-money bets made by his $100 billion Vision Fund had gone spectacularly south, forcing Son to divest assets to pay down debt. Today, the entrepreneur has a new vision, one focused on AI, with investments in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and chip giants Nvidia, TSMC and Intel. The result: Softbank returned to profit in fiscal 2025 after four years in the red, and a surge in its stock has made Son once again Japan’s richest person with a $54 billion fortune. When most businesses were reeling under Covid-19 lockdowns, Singapore-based Sea, an online provider of shopping, games and payment services, led by cofounder Forrest Li, was on a high. It had become Singapore’s most valuable company with a market cap of $69 billion. Today, New York Stock Exchange-listed Sea’s market cap exceeds $110 billion amid buoyant revenue from its gaming (Garena), e-commerce (Shopee) and payments (Monee) arms. Li was first covered by us as an entrepreneur to watch in 2010. Roshni Nadar Malhotra became chairperson of HCL Technologies in 2020, taking over from her billionaire father, Shiv Nadar, who cofounded the company as a garage startup in 1976. That made the former TV news producer one of the first women to lead a listed IT outfit in India and earned her a spot on our annual Asia’s Power Businesswomen list. With the successful takeover of Indonesia’s Bank Permata in 2020, third-generation president Chartsiri Sophonpanich set the stage for a significant expansion of Bangkok Bank’s regional presence. The $2.7 billion deal was the biggest in the bank’s history and marked a departure from its past strategy of growing organically. It also gave Chartsiri, who agreed to a rare interview, a way to cement his legacy at the institution cofounded by his grandfather in 1944. Grab’s group CEO, Anthony Tan, gave us the lowdown on how he planned to take his Singapore-headquartered superapp company, best known for its ride-hailing and delivery services, to the next level. His blueprint included transforming Grab, which he cofounded in 2012, into a listed entity and boosting its presence in fintech. A month later, Grab went public on the Nasdaq via a SPAC merger that valued the company at $40 billion, making it the biggest-ever listing of a Southeast Asian business. Its market cap has since halved to $21 billion. Data centers are multiplying around the world, and one person who saw the coming wave and rode it to become a multibillionaire is Otto Toto Sugiri, cofounder of DCI, Indonesia’s biggest data center operator by capacity. The serial tech entrepreneur launched the country’s first internet service provider in 1994 and is sometimes referred to as Indonesia’s Bill Gates. We sat down with GGV Capital’s Jenny Lee, the first woman to break into the top ten of the Midas ranking in 2012 and who had just completed an unbroken, 11-year run on that list. Now as senior managing partner at Granite Asia, which was split off from GGV in 2024, Singapore-based Lee’s winning streak continues. She was at No. 75 on this year’s Midas List and successfully launched Granite’s first private credit fund in May, securing more than half the targeted $500 million from anchor investors. In the Philippines, billionaire Enrique Razon, known for his twin successes in ports and casinos, was systematically building a third source of wealth: infrastructure. With interests in water utilities, hydropower, gas fields and solar farms, Razon stressed he wasn’t fazed by bureaucratic hurdles. “We’re very persistent, very aggressive. We don’t make crazy proposals. We study things very carefully.” Skyrocketing coal prices resulted in a fivefold jump in the wealth of Low Tuck Kwong, the founder of coal miner Bayan Resources, pushing him to No. 2 on our Indonesia rich list from No. 18 the year before, with a $12.1 billion fortune that has since more than doubled. Despite the global shift toward renewables, Low said he was confident the so-called black gold had a profitable future and of Bayan’s industry prospects, thanks to its low-cost base and low-emissions coal. Hong Kong developer Vincent Lo gambled big on mainland China after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, ploughing money into his Xintiandi lifestyle and entertainment district in Shanghai. The bet paid off, turning his listed Shui On Land into his empire’s crown jewel. A meticulous planner, Lo chose daughter Stephanie as his successor. He continues to bet on China, despite its property distress, agreeing in June to invest in a premium Shanghai project. The wealthy Aboitiz family of the Philippines has a track record of reinventing its portfolio to keep pace with the times. We dug deep into Sabin Aboitiz’s $7 billion blueprint to expand century-old Aboitiz Equity Ventures, the country’s second-biggest electricity producer, into a banking, infrastructure and F&B powerhouse. “We’re transforming from a 100-year-old man to a 25-year-old athlete,” the fourth-generation president and CEO said. Malaysian billionaire brothers Lee Yeow Chor and Lee Yeow Seng, who inherited palm oil business IOI from their late father, Lee Shin Cheng, caught our eye for their bet on property in neighboring Singapore. Up next: a REIT listing that could hold as much as $6.2 billion in assets. The repositioning of Philippine F&B giant San Miguel as a nation builder by chairman Ramon Ang was a compelling story of a self-driven tycoon seeking to cement his legacy while preparing his son John Paul Ang to carry it forward. Third-generation scion Miwako Date’s strategy to double down on Mori Trust’s hotels and resorts business now looks savvy: visitors to Japan, led by the Chinese, surged 21% in the first half of 2025 to 22 million, putting the country on track to draw 45 million visitors this year, as estimated by Mori. Kuok Meng Wei, whose legendary grandfather Robert Kuok was described by Forbes as the world’s shrewdest businessman in a 1997 cover story, revealed his strategy of driving the storied Kuok Group into what he believes is the hottest industry in decades. Backed by his family, the 42-year-old’s K2 Strategic has become one of the leading builders of data centers in the region, notably in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Not long after she brokered a deal with Sam Altman of OpenAI, Shina Chung, the first woman CEO of Kakao, outlined to us her plan to tap its next-gen technology for AI virtual assistants to jumpstart growth at the Korean internet giant. Nikhil Sawhney, fourth-generation successor of a Delhi clan that got its start in the sugar business, gave us the lowdown on how he transformed Triveni Turbine, a company appearing on our Best Under A Billion list for the second year, from a small domestic outfit into the world’s second-largest maker of turbines of up to 100MW capacity. His strategy: a laser focus on R&D and staying “paranoid” about competition.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Sept. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

September 07, 2025 12:10 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Sept. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT), SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Novo lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) Class Period: August 10, 2023 to June 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 6, 2025 According to the complaint, on June 26, 2025, Altimmune published a press release announcing topline results from the IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial of Pemvidutide in the Treatment of MASH. While defendants had continuously provided inflated expectations ahead of these results, the analysis showed a pointed failure by the Company to achieve statistical significance in its analysis of the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint in its IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial. In particular, while a positive trend in fibrosis improvement was observed, statistical significance was not met due to a higher-than-expected placebo response. When questioned about this concerning miss, defendants answered indifferently, attributing this result to the Phase 2 nature of the trial and stated that Altimmune was hoping for better results following the Phase 3 trial. Following this news, the price of Altimmune’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $7.71 per share on June 25, 2025, Altimmune’s stock price fell to $3.61 per share on June 26, 2025, a decline of 53.2% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Altimmune lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ALT SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) Class Period: September 9, 2020 to May 1, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 10, 2025 On May 1, 2025, at approximately noon eastern standard time, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a False Claims Act complaint against SelectQuote, alleging, “[f]rom 2016 through at least 2021”1 SelectQuote received “tens of millions of dollars” in “illegal kickbacks” from health insurance companies in exchange for steering Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the insurers’ plans. Further, SelectQuote, in exchange for kickbacks, engaged in a conspiracy with major insurers to illegally discriminate against beneficiaries deemed to be less profitable, including those with disabilities. The DOJ concluded that SelectQuote made materially false claims by stating it offers “unbiased coverage comparisons” when in fact it “repeatedly directed Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that paid them the most money, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans.” On this news, SelectQuote’s stock price fell $0.61, or 19.2%, to close at $2.56 per share on May 1, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose: (1) that the Company was directing Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that best compensated SelectQuote, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans; (2) that SelectQuote did not provided unbiased comparison shopping for Medicare Advantage insurance plans; (3) that SelectQuote received illegal kickbacks to steer Medicare beneficiaries to certain insurers and limit enrollment in competitors’ plans; (4) that as a result, SelectQuote had not complied with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions; (5) that SelectQuote was vulnerable to regulatory and legal sanctions as a result of its conduct, including claims that it had violated the False Claims Act; and (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the SelectQuote lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SLQT Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI) Class Period: March 17, 2022 to September 22, 2022 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 24, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Spectrum’s Pinnacle Study of poziotinib for the treatment of lung cancer was less positive than it portrayed to investors. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period.

Title: Job Growth Sputters: Rate Cuts And Recession Incoming?

Time Published: 2025-09-07T11:00:00Z

ByBill Stone, Contributor. Worse-than-expected job growth on Friday sent the S&P 500 lower after reaching a closing high on Thursday. Employment grew by just 22,000 nonfarm jobs, which was below expectations. Previous data was revised slightly lower, though only by 21,000, compared to the massive downward revision last month. The household survey data were solid, with a gain of 288,000 jobs following a decline of 260,000 jobs the previous month. The household survey research series, which aligns with the payroll report criteria, increased by 781,000. The significant increase in the research series is merely little more than a slight reversal of the 753,000 decline from the previous month. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3% from 4.2%. This increase in unemployment was mainly due to relatively positive reasons, with job gains of 288,000 in the household survey and an increase of 436,000 in the labor force. The underemployment rate is a broader measure of unemployment, which includes “unemployed people, plus everyone marginally attached to the workforce, plus all people employed part-time for economic reasons.” The underemployment rate is 1.5 percentage points above the December 2022 low, while the unemployment rate has risen 0.9 percentage points from its low. The underemployment rate can serve as a leading indicator of unemployment, reflecting the growing slack in the labor market. Wage growth was below expectations at 3.7% year-over-year, down from 3.9% last month. The average workweek hours held steady at 34.2, just above the five-year low of 34.1 in January, which was depressed by weather and the LA fires. Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio has been teetering around the current level, but the labor market has remained resilient. It should be monitored closely, but it has been able to maintain a steady level so far and improved fractionally this month. Initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits remain benign. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. The Sahm Rule states that a recession begins when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises by 0.5 percentage points or more relative to its low during the previous 12 months. The three-month average of the US unemployment rate is 4.23%, well below the 4.51% Sahm Rule trigger. The Sahm Rule has had an unblemished historical record of predicting recessions. However, its perfection is in jeopardy since the rule was triggered in July and September 2024 with no economic contraction yet in sight. Another useful predictor of recessions has been earnings growth, as a recession is typically associated with a year-over-year decline in corporate profits. For this analysis, the NIPA corporate profits are used rather than S&P 500 earnings. NIPA data includes all US companies, including both public and private entities, as well as small companies and S corporations. For the second quarter of 2025, NIPA profits grew by 4.3% year-over-year, which remains positive but looks to be decelerating. Notably, S&P 500 earnings grew at a 12% year-over-year pace; however, much of that rapid growth was driven by technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Therefore, NIPA provides a better window into the overall economy. Following the weaker jobs data, markets expect three 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025. The softer labor market has made a 25-basis-point cut at the Federal Reserve’s September 17 meeting a virtual certainty. Bottom line: Following the shockingly large downward revision last month, this month’s jobs report makes it clear that the labor market has been softening and is teetering on the edge. These facts will not escape the Fed’s notice, so a September rate cut is now a fait accompli following the release of the monthly payrolls report last week. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high during the week but declined fractionally on Friday following the release of the jobs report. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed primarily due to a favorable legal outcome for Alphabet and enthusiasm about Elon Musk’s ambitious Tesla performance targets. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied to new highs. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Though the recession odds rose intra-week, the betting odds held steady week-over-week. There are only four companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, but Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE) are certainly notable. Producer (PPI) and consumer inflation (CPI) rates for August are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday respectively. While a higher-than-expected PPI report would garner attention, the CPI will be more critical, as the extent to which price increases, including those from tariffs, reach consumers is the crucial variable. CPI is expected to rise year-over-year to 2.9% from 2.7%. The consensus forecast is consistent with the estimates from the Cleveland Fed, so this result is unlikely to hinder the September rate cut. A hot set of inflation reports would likely decrease the number of rate cuts expected in 2025, rather than endangering the September move. Despite the slight decline on Friday, stocks are still pricing in low odds of recession and forecasting that the Fed will begin rate cuts soon enough for this to remain a soft spot in the labor market rather than a full-fledged downturn. The bond market is less sure of the Fed’s success, with corporate bond spreads widening to levels last seen during the build-up to the tariff worries earlier in the year. While conditions should be monitored closely, there is currently little evidence of an impending recession. However, as noted, some storm clouds are on the horizon that could shift the economy in that direction.

A hot set of inflation reports would likely decrease the number of rate cuts expected in 2025, rather than endangering the September move. Despite the slight decline on Friday, stocks are still pricing in low odds of recession and forecasting that the Fed will begin rate cuts soon enough for this to remain a soft spot in the labor market rather than a full-fledged downturn. The bond market is less sure of the Fed’s success, with corporate bond spreads widening to levels last seen during the build-up to the tariff worries earlier in the year. While conditions should be monitored closely, there is currently little evidence of an impending recession. However, as noted, some storm clouds are on the horizon that could shift the economy in that direction.

Title: Amazon has lots of software bugs with Kindle Updates

The latest Amazon Kindle software update, which includes all the new accessibility features, has been a resounding success. However, there are always a few bugs that need to be addressed. The 15.8.4 update causes the screen to flicker constantly, but this issue can be resolved with a reboot. Multiple popups appear, blank and without any text. Sideloaded books had invalid ASIN numbers, but this issue has been resolved with a new Calibre update issued on September 5th. The update also has errors with borrowing e-books from the Kindle Unlimited program. Many of the books that users want to download are not downloading properly. The only way to fix this issue is to factory reset the Kindle, which will obviously delete all your content, including sideloaded books. Obviously, users should not have to go to these great lengths to use their Kindle as they normally would. Software updates have been causing more problems for the past couple of years, causing more problems than they solve. This started in 2022 when Amazon switched its programming language from JavaScript to React Native. This happened right after the new home screen experience was rolled out. Instead of your library being on the home screen, it now features page after page of recommendations and Amazon trying to sell you more Kindle Books. Firmware updates have been steadily deteriorating after the programming change. Still, they reached a breaking point every year since Amazon conducted layoffs of Kindle executives, engineers, programmers, and the book recommendations team. Hundreds of people left during those years, and dozens more did so due to the increased workload, but their pay remained the same. A few people in the Kindle division told me last month that morale is at an all-time low and Amazon simply doesn’t really care about Fire Tablets, Kindles, and Fire TV boxes anymore.

Title: Perfect Competition Will Crush AI Profits
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/perfect-competition-will-crush-ai-profits/
Time Published: 2025-09-06T14:30:01Z
Full Content:
By Dan Amoss PostedSeptember 6, 2025 Today’s AI investment craze suffers from the same flawed assumptions that sparked past bubbles. Without a course correction, the U.S. economy faces a self-inflicted bust. In the mid-2000s, Wall Street’s best and brightest were packaging subprime loans into complex securities and assuring the world they were safe. Regulators nodded. Rating agencies blessed them. Investors snapped them up. Few asked the obvious question: What if the assumptions behind these instruments are wrong? Today, a similar blind spot is spreading through the economy – not through mortgages, but through artificial intelligence (AI). Everyone from Big Tech giants to startup founders, institutional investors, and Washington policymakers is convinced that artificial intelligence is a revolutionary technology, and that big capital expenditures (capex) today will lead to countless industrywide profits in the future. But there’s a problem: Demand in value-added, real-world applications is unlikely to be large enough to justify all this investment. The demand that AI promoters constantly highlight is drawn from Large language model (LLM) training sessions and queries – neither of which is associated with much sustainable, real-world revenue. Much of the revenue being booked in this ecosystem ultimately comes from a limited pool of venture capital (VC) funds. A recent story from The Information estimated that these LLM companies generate roughly $18.5 billion in annualized revenue. Ironically, The Information was trying to rebut the claims from an MIT Media Lab report that concluded 95% of businesses are seeing no return on AI pilot projects. It’s ironic because $18.5 billion in annualized revenue is peanuts relative to the astonishingly large amount of capital poured into these companies. The revenue streams in the chart above are also not very valuable because LLM companies are not showing positive operating leverage. Plenty of evidence indicates that costs scale alongside revenue at LLM companies. Heavy users burn lots of electricity and shorten Nvidia chips’ lives in their usage of the models. And free users will just switch to a competing LLM if ever required to pay a subscription fee. Today’s AI investment mania has two key blind spots: the fallacy of composition and adverse selection. Let’s break those down. The fallacy of composition is the mistaken belief that what’s true for one player is true for all. If one company like Microsoft makes money selling AI products, then investors assume the entire AI sector will do the same. But that’s not how competitive markets work. In fact, success in a competitive market often comes at the expense of rivals. There can be winners, but not everyone can win. This fallacy infected the telecom boom of the late 1990s. Just because one broadband provider had profitable demand didn’t mean every fiber-optic network was worth building. Billions were spent laying cables that no one would use for another decade. Then there’s adverse selection. In insurance, this happens when sick people are more likely to buy health insurance than healthy people, leading to losses for the insurer that doesn’t attract enough healthy customers. In AI, something similar is unfolding: the heaviest users of AI chatbots and tools – those demanding the most computing resources – are often not paying enough in subscription fees to cover their costs to the LLM provider. The casual users, who make up the vast majority, may never convert to paying customers. This undermines the very business model these companies are betting on. What happens when the market discovers this? You get a doom loop: companies overspend on infrastructure, hoping for future demand that never materializes, while investors keep piling in – until someone finally notices the emperor is minimally clothed. There’s a popular narrative that the so-called “Magnificent 7” (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla) will capture most of the economic value created by AI. But history suggests otherwise. In past tech revolutions, the biggest winners weren’t always the biggest companies. The advent of the internet helped millions of small and mid-sized businesses gain customers and compete globally. Low-cost e-commerce tools like Shopify and advertising platforms like Google and Facebook gave them the reach they never had before. Similarly, it’s possible that AI’s biggest beneficiaries won’t be the firms building the models, but the dentists, restaurant owners, and local manufacturers who use those tools to accelerate mundane processes and serve customers better. The irony? While these SMBs (small- and medium-sized businesses) benefit, the AI platforms enabling them may struggle to get paid. If Google’s new Veo video model helps a dentist craft a great local ad, will that dentist pay Google more? One of the most dangerous assumptions in AI capex is that these platforms will enjoy pricing power – meaning they can charge enough to cover their costs and then some. But look closely, and this assumption crumbles. The AI chatbot market looks a lot like perfect competition, a textbook term for markets where many providers offer nearly identical products, and prices fall toward the cost of production. Unlike the broadband boom of the 2000s, where companies had to rip up streets to lay wires and customers had few broadband alternatives, switching from one AI model to another takes a few clicks. If you’re a free user of ChatGPT, and it suddenly costs $20 a month to use it at all, but Claude or Gemini is free and just as good, nothing is stopping you from switching. That’s the nightmare scenario for the AI providers: they’ve built massive infrastructure assuming recurring subscription revenue, but the customer base may have no loyalty and little willingness to pay. It’s like investing billions into oil wells only to find out your oil sells for $10 a barrel instead of $70. In a healthy economy, production and consumption communicate constantly. If a company builds something useful, customers respond by buying it. If they overbuild, inventories pile up and prices fall, sending a signal to slow down. AI infrastructure, by contrast, is being built largely on faith. Companies are scaling up compute power without clear signs of sustainable demand. Unlike oil and gas, where prices adjust second-by-second, AI companies operate in a fog. They release tools, collect usage stats, and hope that paid conversions will follow. But hope is not a business model. In fact, today’s AI leaders resemble 2006-era banks more than healthy, feedback-driven enterprises. They’re in an unhealthy relationship with venture capital (VC) firms that need higher and higher valuation “marks” to justify their fees. VC firms don’t want transparency about customer conversion rates, churn, or operating losses that scale with revenue. That would kill the narrative before the VCs can cash out in IPOs to the public market. Meanwhile, China is asking a much more grounded question: How can we use AI to make real-world industries more efficient? Companies like DeepSeek are building AI tools designed to solve narrow problems in energy, logistics, and manufacturing. That’s closer to how the human brain works – selectively activating regions based on the task at hand. And it’s proving to be more effective than trying to create superintelligence in a box. While U.S. Big Tech chases lofty visions of artificial general intelligence (AGI) – often undefined and possibly unachievable – China is deploying AI in practical ways that produce results. To compete, the U.S. must start asking more rigorous questions: What is AI actually for? Who pays for it? And how does it improve the lives of average Americans? If there’s one place where AI hype is meeting hard reality, it’s software engineering. Veteran developer Carl Brown, in an interview with Ed Zitron, shredded the idea that large language models (LLMs) will replace human coders anytime soon. He explained how writing code is only a small part of the job. The real work is long-term thinking, fixing bugs, and figuring out what the software should do. AI tools can crank out lines of code fast. But they often do it sloppily, duplicating functions and ignoring best practices. The result is software that’s harder to maintain, easier to hack, and more prone to crashing. Brown compared AI code to “vibe coding,” which is typing something into a chatbot and hoping it works. That might be fine for a one-time prototype, but it’s a recipe for disaster in a software program that’s meant to last. Worse still, managers – who assume AI is miraculous because they hear about it so much on CNBC – don’t understand programming. These managers are using AI to justify layoffs or to demand unrealistic productivity increases from their teams. This may create a generation of junior engineers who never learn to code properly because they’re relying on tools that don’t understand the long game of software development. It’s often claimed that software is the most natural market for AI to disrupt. However, Carl Brown’s view, plus dozens of other examples, confirm that in real-world stress tests, AI misses too many things, or hallucinates too often, to be considered a revolutionary technology trend. So, in the months ahead, we’re likely to see more hints that Big Tech companies are tapping the brakes on Nvidia chip orders. They’ll do this to avoid an accelerating decline in their free cash flows – a trend that’s already looking scary. For example, see this projection from BofA Global Research. It shows capital spending as a percentage of operating cash flow at the companies building hyperscale data centers. A recession or a bust in venture capital funding for AI LLM companies (like OpenAI) could drive operating cash flow lower. That would make the BofA chart surge higher than they project in the dotted lines. And higher capex relative to cash flow means free cash flow would dive toward zero. To avoid that scenario, hyperscale data center operators would cut AI chip orders. Editor’s note: Members of Strategic Intelligence Pro can access Dan’s full report, including the stock pick, here.

Title: ROSEN, RECOGNIZED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - NVO

September 06, 2025 10:12 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Analyst Forecasts XRP To Stage Amazon-Like Rally To $200
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/analyst-forecasts-xrp-to-stage-amazon-like-rally-to-200/
Time Published: 2025-09-06T12:30:29Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP has drawn plenty of comparisons over the past few months, but one analyst believes the best way to understand its future is to look at Amazon’s past. Nick Anderson, better known as BULLRUNNERS on the social media platform X, says XRP is going through the same kind of consolidation Amazon faced in 2010, and it still has the potential to rally to $200. The key difference, however, is the patience investors will need before this rally can happen. XRP’s price action in the past seven days has been highlighted by a trading range between $2.8 and $2.9. The cryptocurrency now seems stuck within this range, but it has managed to hold above $2.8 for the meantime. Interestingly, Anderson likened this consolidation move to a similar retest of a previous high by the Amazon stock (AMZN) back in 2010. In his post, Anderson highlighted how Amazon stock spent roughly 3,800 days consolidating after the dot-com crash before finally breaking past its previous high and entering a meteoric run. However, before entering into this meteoric run, it consolidated for a few months in 2010 just after breaking above its previous high during the dot-com bubble. According to Anderson, XRP’s current structure is tracing out a massive cup and handle that mirrors this exact Amazon stock setup, with the cryptocurrency now using past highs as support in the same way Amazon did. Just as Amazon transformed once it cleared resistance, Anderson believes XRP could follow a similar breakout trajectory that could eventually push its price above $100, and possibly as high as $200. In his assessment, Anderson noted that this predicted rally to $200 might take many years to come to fruition. Comparing today’s price of around $2.80 to Amazon’s $5 launch point before its monumental rally, this would probably be the best time for XRP investors to accumulate for the long term. For younger investors, holding XRP for the next 10 to 15 years could prove transformative, with as little as 10,000 XRP amounting to $1 million in value if the cryptocurrency eventually climbs to $100. Despite his long-term forecast, Anderson is more cautious about what XRP might achieve this cycle. He stated that while a push to $100 in the near term would be “absolutely insane”, a more realistic target for this bull run could lie between $5 and $30. After that, he expects another correction to set in before the rally resumes sometime around the end of the decade. Anderson also left room for a more explosive scenario, noting that XRP could deliver what he called a “giga rally” if liquidity rushes into the market faster than expected. This is based on the growing anticipation around the adoption of ISO 20022 by the US Federal Reserve. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.81.

Title: Volatility Is Back, And This 7.8% CEF Is Here To Get Us Through It

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. A market on a precipice. That’s the vibe around stocks right now, and I’m guessing you’ve felt it, too. On the one hand, the S&P 500 is up 14% in the past year, a very solid performance (and for the record, I see more gains ahead). Yet volatility has returned, and it feels like we could be on the verge of another selloff. So what do we do right now? We’re going to look at a closed-end fund (CEF) that profits from short-term volatility. In fact, this one harnesses the energy that choppy markets throw off and “converts” it to a hefty dividend stream. The result? This CEF takes the low-yielding (mainly) tech stocks in the NASDAQ 100 (average yield: 0.5%) and bumps that up to a solid 7.8% dividend. But I’m getting a bit ahead of myself. Before we go further, let me touch on why I feel that, over the long term, more gains are ahead for US stocks. For one, the value of long-term bonds has dropped, showing that investors still have a healthy appetite for risk, selling, as they are, some of the safest investments out there. Stocks (particularly tech stocks) are the obvious destination for these investors. At the same time, the stock market is backed up by the US economy’s continued strong growth. What’s important is what’s going on after the effects of inflation. In real terms, US GDP growth in 2025 has been around 2% on a year-over-year basis. It’s a solid clip that’s topped expectations, with many economists predicting less than 1% growth. Then there’s the most current economic estimate we have, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow indicator, which shows growth accelerating, spiking to over 3% in the third quarter. What’s behind this expansion? AI, for one: Investments in the tech will hit $400 billion this year, up 60% from 2024—and they’re still growing fast. It’s clear that AI, whatever we may think about it, is a boon to the economy, and the momentum is not letting up. Of course, in the short term, investors will fret, which is why any downturns are buying opportunities. But what can we do now, with stocks having tempered their recent gains and before we see the next significant drop? This is where that CEF I mentioned earlier comes in: It sells call options, or the right for buyers to purchase its holdings at a fixed price and a fixed date in the future. It then uses that cash to fuel its 7.8% payout. It’s a nice dividend play while we wait for the next selloff to put stocks—and the “pure” equity-focused CEFs I prefer for the long run—back on sale. Tech stocks are perfect for covered-call selling because they’re sensitive to the kinds of panic selloffs we’re likely to see as AI optimism ebbs and flows, with an ebbing of sentiment seemingly around the corner. (For the record, though, in the long run, I see Big Tech’s AI investments as likely to be worth it—the productivity gains the technology offers are just too great.) The go-to covered-call fund here is the Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX). Since it owns the NASDAQ 100, its portfolio is a who’s-who of companies driving the AI boom. NVIDIA (NVDA) is its biggest holding, at nearly 10% of the portfolio, followed by Microsoft (MSFT). The NASDAQ is up 90% over the last three years, while the S&P 500 is up just 63%, showing how much money there is to be made in investing in tech over the long term. But as you’ve no doubt noticed, the NASDAQ’s volatility is always higher, and can spike in times of panic, like what we saw during the April “tariff tantrum.” In short: Buying the NASDAQ is great, but you need nerves of steel while you hold it. That’s where QQQX comes in, “translating” that volatility into a regular quarterly dividend that gives investors that 7.8% income stream. That by itself is why QQQX is a strong candidate when market jitters push up volatility. But there’s another: QQQX is especially cheap now. Over the last decade, QQQX has had an average discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) of 1.7%. It’s now 7.7%, and it was even lower in the last few months, averaging about 10% throughout 2024 and the first few months of this year. Why is it a bit narrower now? Because investors are realizing that QQQX’s investments continue to appreciate, as does its ability to boost dividends. Those strengths should help its discount to move toward par, where it traded in the 2010s. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Serious U.S. Dollar Fed Warning Issued As Bitcoin Mounts $24 Trillion Gold Price Challenge

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has surged this year, topping $124,000 per bitcoin in August as a growing crisis at the Federal Reserve takes a surprising turn. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price has doubled since this time last year—with some now predicting bitcoin is on the brink of a $84 trillion shock—with the massive $4 trillion rally causing some of the world’s biggest celebrities to jump on the crypto bandwagon. Now, as the new crypto gold rush forges what could be the new “Rockefellers or Rothschilds,” Goldman Sachs analysts have warned the U.S. dollar’s global reserve-currency status could be eaten away by gold—just as bitcoin comes for its safe-haven asset crown. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “A scenario where Fed independence is damaged would likely lead to higher inflation, lower stock and long-dated bond prices, and an erosion of the dollar’s reserve-currency status,” Goldman analysts including Samantha Dart wrote in a note to clients seen by Bloomberg. “In contrast, gold is a store of value that doesn’t rely on institutional trust.” Trump has been ramping up his war of words against the Federal Reserve this year, attacking Fed chair Jerome Powell as economists warn of a looming dollar disaster. Trump has threatened to fire Powell and tried to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook, sparking fears over the future of the Fed’s independence from the White House. Dart predicted the gold price could surge to $5,000 an ounce if U.S. president Donald Trump’s war on the Fed causes global investors to lose confidence in bonds, stocks, and the dollar, with only a small shift from the massive Treasuries market into bullion enough to trigger outsized gains. “As a result, gold remains our highest-conviction long recommendation in the commodities space," Dart wrote, adding, “we estimate that if 1% of the privately owned U.S. Treasury market were to flow into gold, the gold price would rise to nearly $5,000/[troy ounce], assuming everything else constant." Gold’s rally this year, climbing from $2,500 an ounce 12 months ago to $3,600 today and giving gold a $24 trillion market capitalization, has come alongside a bitcoin price boom that’s sent bitcoin, sometimes called digital gold, to record highs. “[Bitcoin] sits at the intersection of gold and equities—an emerging store of value that thrives when liquidity rotates into risk,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments following the latest U.S. jobs report coming in below expectations, setting up the Federal Reserve to cut rates later this month as U.S. president Donald Trump has called for. “With $7.2 trillion in money market funds likely to move as yields fall, bitcoin offers the ultimate hybrid profile: digital gold for safety, and asymmetric upside as a risk-on asset. Seasonality also strengthens the setup, with the fourth quarter historically bitcoin’s strongest quarter—the asset has only seen two negative Octobers in its entire history— suggesting that as liquidity returns, buying pressure could accelerate into year-end.” Technical analysis comparing bitcoin to gold by Coindesk shows the bitcoin price could be headed for “a potential breakout by late in the fourth quarter or early next year.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market Meanwhile, the World Gold Council is developing a digitalized form of gold as fears grow that bitcoin could replace it as the world's safe-haven asset. "We are trying to standardise that digital layer of gold, such that the various financial products used in other markets can be used in the gold market going forward,” David Tait, a former banker and chief executive of the World Gold Council, an industry body representing gold miners, told the Financial Times. “My goal is that many asset managers around the world will suddenly look at it differently." Fears that bitcoin could overtake gold among investors seeking exposure to a scarce, non-governmental or corporate asset have been heightened by the rapid rise of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which now hold almost as much in assets under management (AUM) as gold ETFs despite spot bitcoin ETFs only being launched at the beginning of 2024. "How long before AUM in 'digital gold’ ETFs surpasses physical? Bitcoin ETF assets are closing in on gold ETF assets," financial markets research company Bespoke’s account posted to X, pointing to data that showed they are now worth $150 billion and $180 billion, respectively.

Ireland and Hungary go head-to-head in a FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier in Dublin on Saturday evening. Both sides will be searching for a positive start to their Group F campaign, in an intriguing group that also contains Portugal and Armenia. Ireland manager Heimir Hallgrímsson has named a 23-man squad for the games against Hungary and Armenia, although there are some notable absences. Captain Seamus Coleman has been left out after being an unused substitute in Everton’s opening three Premier League matches this season. The experienced defender has not featured since withdrawing from the June friendlies through injury. Gavin Bazunu and Chiedozie Ogbene return to the squad after lengthy injury layoffs. Bazunu has recovered from knee surgery to reclaim his place at Southampton, while Ogbene is back for the first time since rupturing his Achilles tendon in October 2024. Celtic defender Liam Scales is available to play after rolling his ankle against Rangers at the weekend, while Johnny Kenny has come in as attacking cover after Troy Parrott pulled out of the squad. Nathan Collins will captain the side in Coleman’s absence, with Caoimhín Kelleher providing experience in goal after his move from Liverpool to Brentford. However, Robbie Brady, Callum O’Dowda and Festy Ebosele all miss out through injury. Read – The mind-blowing numbers behind record-breaking transfer window Hungary manager Marco Rossi has named a larger-than-usual 27-man squad, including four potential debutants. The Italian coach has emphasised selecting players in good form, with Barna Tóth, Rajmund Molnár, Dániel Lukács and Bence Ötvös all earning their first call-ups. Liverpool star Dominik Szoboszlai will captain the side, with the 24-year-old having been Hungary’s talisman since taking over the armband in November 2022. However, there are concerns over Hungary’s over-reliance on their skipper, with the team struggling when he is marked out of games. Milos Kerkez, Willi Orbán and András Schäfer provide experience in the squad, while striker Barnabás Varga remains a key attacking threat. Rossi has stressed the importance of starting the campaign well against a physical Irish side. Read – The biggest Champions League omissions as squad lists announced Hallgrímsson’s side have shown gradual improvement since replacing Stephen Kenny in the hot seat last year. They secured their League B status in the UEFA Nations League, defeating Bulgaria 4-2 on aggregate in a relegation playoff. Their most recent friendlies both ended in stalemates against Senegal (1-1) and Luxembourg (0-0), highlighting their struggles in front of goal. Marco Rossi’s team endured a difficult Nations League campaign, finishing bottom of Group A3. They were relegated after losing 6-1 on aggregate to Turkey in the promotion/relegation playoffs. Recent friendlies brought mixed results, with a 2-1 win over Azerbaijan and a 0-2 defeat to Sweden. Read – Lionel Messi gets Argentina farewell he ‘always dreamed of’ Possible Ireland starting XI: Kelleher; Doherty, O’Shea, Collins, Scales; Johnston, Knight, Cullen, Manning; Azaz, Ferguson.

Resources from this episode: Ben Greenfield [00:00:00]: My name is Ben Greenfield, and on this episode of the Boundless Life podcast. Jordan Rubin [00:00:04]: I immediately realized this isn't leaves that the Bible is talking about. This specifically is a leaf from a fruit tree. And as soon as that passage of scripture came out of the app into my ears, I felt God say with as audible of a voice as I have ever heard, this is it. Ben Greenfield [00:00:27]: Welcome to the Boundless Life with me, your host, Ben Greenfield, personal trainer, exercise physiologist, and nutritionist. And I'm passionate about helping you discover unparalleled levels of health, fitness, longevity, and beyond. Ben Greenfield [00:00:48]: Right before I started recording, I was telling my podcast guest that the family and I like to memorize Bible verses, and we're working through Psalms right now. Psalm 139, he said they have a psalm. He and his family have a psalm that they recite. I think you said, Jordan, every night at dinner. Jordan Rubin [00:01:06]: Every night when we're together, Ben, which is not every night, but we try to do it, yes. Ben Greenfield [00:01:11]: And you said it's a Psalm of protection. Jordan Rubin [00:01:15]: Yes, Psalm 91. And there have been at least three books written about those who recite Psalm 91 and avoiding major catastrophes when others around them were dying. So, yeah, very cool stuff. But, yeah, Psalm 91, I would call it a moderate length psalm, very worth memorizing. And the man who helped me get well, taught me to eat and live from the Bible in 1996, used to have all of his kids quote this every morning before homeschool. So it kind of stuck with me for the last 31 years. And almost every day we quote it together as a family or we'll sort of popcorn where one person says part of it and the next person. So it's kind of. Jordan Rubin [00:02:00]: Kind of cool, but it is. It is one of the things we do. And at dinner when we're together. Ben Greenfield [00:02:05]: I won't put you on the spot and have you do the whole thing right now, but what's your favorite verse or one of your favorite verses from Psalm 91? Jordan Rubin [00:02:11]: Well, what I like to do with Psalm 91 because I really believe that faith and imagination are one and the same. So Psalm 91 is sort of like an action psalm. It talks about treading on serpents and scorpions. So what I like to say or what I like to do is think about myself living it out. But the best for me is, "He will give his angels charge over you to keep you in all your ways. They will bear you up in their hands so you don't dash your foot against a stone." So I kind of picture myself falling off a cliff, angels catching me and having a soft Superman-like landing. You know how Superman in the old days had his back foot kicked up and all that with the Christopher Reeve version. Ben Greenfield [00:02:56]: Right, maybe with the fist going down into the ground. Jordan Rubin [00:02:59]: Yeah, maybe not that much, but yeah, that's more like, I will tread upon the lion and the adder, the young lion and the dragon while I trample underfoot. That's more of the violent kicking and punching part. Ben Greenfield [00:03:09]: Yeah, yeah. I'm reading a book right now called Experiencing Jesus by John Eldredge, and he also has an app, like a guided prayer app that I just love. And he actually, in last night's reading was talking about how in some, I guess it would be almost like Jewish lore, serpents and scorpions would be associated with what a lot of people are talking about now, maybe thanks to guys like Joe Rogan, the nephilim, fallen angels, demons, spirits, et cetera. So it's almost as though that psalm would be like a protective prayer for going to battle against the spirits of the dark world. Jordan Rubin [00:03:46]: Well, yeah, it is funny you should mention that because a lot of this has been happening to me as well. And I'm in a men's prayer and Bible study group with my old high school friends and I just read Waking the Dead. And then we did Wild at Heart for the umpteenth time last month. So, yeah, so we're, we're, we're John Eldridging it as well over here. Ben Greenfield [00:04:10]: He's been on the podcast, if you guys are listening. Well, this is Jordan Rubin, who I'm talking with right now. I haven't given Jordan an introduction yet, but I will shortly. John Eldredge is the other guy we're talking about. And if you want some good devotionals, devotional apps, and you want a little bit, I guess, more of almost like a, a mystical, personal relationship with Jesus. I love his writings for just taking one out of the didactic and deep into the spiritual, soulful experience of Jesus. So highly recommend his stuff and I'll put a link to my interview with him in the show notes. Jordan, though, is my guest today. Ben Greenfield [00:04:49]: 3-peat - did you know this is the third time, Jordan? Jordan Rubin [00:04:51]: Yes. Ben Greenfield [00:04:52]: Yeah. Yeah. So our first one was about ducks and chickens and yaks and cows and eating locusts. And we actually touched on Bible-based eating in that first podcast. And then we did another one where you just basically fed me and the audience through the fire hose about how to start your own farm and grow your own food and grow crazy things on mushrooms and your insane productivity habits and your spiritual routines. So this third time around, I was inspired to invite you because you finished this book with another former podcast guest and friend of mine, Dr. Josh Axe. The Biblio Diet. Ben Greenfield [00:05:29]: I think the name kind of gives it away. A diet and lifestyle plan inspired by biblical principles. Just so those of, you know, opening the kimono. Jordan and I had a phone call maybe four weeks ago and he was explaining to me some crazy things he's been studying up on and learning about. Fruit leaves, of all things. And I was so intrigued by that that I wanted to touch on that in today's show, but also just cover some of the important principles in this book. Jordan is an OG in the industry. He's the founder of Garden of Life, Beyond Organic, Ancient Nutrition. Ben Greenfield [00:06:02]: He is one of America's most recognized and respected natural health experts. New York Times bestselling author of over 30 books. And this latest one, the Biblio Diet, is fantastic. If you've ever wondered how to eat the way that perhaps God intended us to. So, Jordan, welcome back for this third time, man. Jordan Rubin [00:06:22]: Thanks for having me - excited. Ben Greenfield [00:06:24]: Yeah, I want to jump right in to the thing that I don't want to run out of time to talk about. And what, like I mentioned, got me most intrigued to interview you for this book. This whole idea of healing leaves your entire chapter, chapter 14 is about it. Tell me about your inspiration to get into this. Jordan Rubin [00:06:41]: It's interesting that we talk about this now because, Ben, as you'll remember, when we were having our phone call, I said this is not enough time to share with you the most powerful revelation I have ever received about health. And I say that because it is a big deal. Having overcome inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's colitis and cancer to now, after all that time, receive this revelation. Not to mention the fact that I, you and so many of us have read the Bible back and forth, cover to cover dozens and I think I'm over a hundred times. And yet it wasn't until 2019 when two powerful scriptures leapt off the pages and changed my life forever and I believe changed my future forever, which is pretty amazing for a book that was written thousands of years ago. Ben Greenfield [00:07:32]: All right, so I know we didn't have a lot of time in our phone call for you to cover this. I think we had 20 minutes and you were doing the two year catch up with me. But we have time right now. So tell me about these verses and the inspiration. Jordan Rubin [00:07:44]: Yeah, so this is going to be in the area of mystical, as you called it earlier, if you're referring to certain writings. But my wife, Nikki, who by the way, is a retired CPA, I'm setting the stage because she is not a forest-through-the- trees visionary by trade. However, God has gotten a hold of her and given her some pretty amazing—what she would refer to—as downloads. And in the summer of 2018, so we're dating back, she tells me that she had a God idea. Now, she didn't say it was a prophecy. She didn't say it was a word from the Lord. She said it was a God idea. And she heard herself asking God a question: "Is Jordan going to discover the cure for cancer and win a Nobel Prize?" Now, Ben, I know what that sounds like. Ben Greenfield [00:08:43]: Yeah, obviously, like half the internet snickers when they hear that because everybody says the cure for cancer. So you've got quite a defense to make. Jordan Rubin [00:08:51]: Yes, I'm sharing it exactly as she said it. Now, what's interesting is she felt like this God idea happened six months prior to her sharing it with me, which was December of 2018. And when she did share it with me, my reaction was actually frustration, not jubilation. I mean, here I have this information from my wife, who I trust immensely if anyone's going to tell me God said anything—I have learned that Nikki is one who is very discerning and wise, and a lot of us should know that about our wives if we don't. So she says it to me. I'm frustrated. The reason I was frustrated, Ben, is that I was able to, through God's supernatural power and natural healing, conquer cancer myself... Jordan Rubin [00:09:41]: ...in 2008, when I was given a 0% chance to live. Not one, not two, zero. Like the doctor said, there's a 100% chance you'll be dead in three months if you don't undergo chemo and a very invasive surgery and possibly radiation. And I didn't, and God healed me. But before I get into that, let me finish the healing leaves message. So I'm frustrated because I have spent the better part of my life at this point in 2019 helping people overcome cancer, studying, researching, you name it. It has been a huge topic of mine, including overcoming cancer myself. So for me to hear that there's some cure for cancer, my immediate thought was, well, if it's a medicine, 99% of the world can't afford it or they're not insured. Jordan Rubin [00:10:33]: If it's an Amazonian rainforest herb, it's probably rare and most people can't afford it or procure it - Ben Greenfield [00:10:40]: - or it's not sustainable environmentally. Jordan Rubin [00:10:43]: Exactly. So I stopped thinking about it. And it wasn't until four months later, April 19, I remember the day, 2019. I was in my sauna, which I call my prayer sauna or prayer closet. And so when I'm in my sauna, I often listen to the Bible on an app more than I read it. I don't want to sweat on the Bible, first of all, but it's just great to be an audible learner, and I like to use technology for good whenever I can. So I'm listening to Ezekiel, which some would consider a boring book in the Old Testament, but it gets to Ezekiel in the 40s. And Ezekiel is describing a scene where there's a temple or a sanctuary, there's water coming from the temple, there's trees on both sides of the stream or river that the water forms. Jordan Rubin [00:11:34]: And I almost went multitask because I've heard this next verse so many times. Ezekiel 47:12. It says: "The fruit will be for food and the leaves for healing." Now, Ben, I've read herbal books that are not biblically based, and almost every one of them will quote this verse just as a quote unquote proverb, you know, like an African proverb or an Indian proverb. And then they'll go on to say, therefore, since the leaves are for healing, you should consume spinach and parsley and kale. Ben Greenfield [00:12:11]: You mean basically interpreting it as eat salads and dark leafy greens? Jordan Rubin [00:12:15]: Exactly. And over and over again, when I've read this and I'm talking about herbal OGs like Dr. James Duke and others who are not necessarily writing from a Christian perspective, they are just simply saying all cultures believe in leaves. Well, the truth of the matter is because I have understood the difference between a perennial plant like a tree or a bush, and an annual plant like a carrot or kale or spinach, where you plant it once, disrupt the soil, harvest it, et cetera, I immediately realized this isn't leaves that the Bible is talking about. This specifically is a leaf from a fruit tree. And as soon as that passage of scripture came out of the app into my ears, I felt God say with as audible of a voice as I have ever heard, "This is it." So four months after my wife's God idea, I'm listening to Ezekiel 47:12: "The fruit will be for food and the leaves for healing." And I walk out of the sauna and I tell my wife, I said, "Nikki, I know my life's purpose." Jordan Rubin [00:13:26]: Because, Ben, I immediately realized that the word that Nikki received—this answer for cancer—was not going to be found in a medicine or in an Amazonian superfood. It was found in one of the most ubiquitous, largely resourced trash that people allow to be composted or pay to take off their property: fruit tree leaves. And I began to research the ancient Hebrew language to understand two things. One, what is a tree? Because would it only include bananas and apples? And did it have to be 30ft tall? What about a bush? What about a vine? What about a shrub? And number two, and most importantly, the verse or the word that says healing—could it be mistranslated because it says the fruit is for food and the leaves for healing? I've heard people mistranslate Bible quotes all the time. Now, this word, teruphah or terupah means healing, medicine, or cure. That is all it could mean. And here I am, someone who has written at the time, I want to say, 15 books on biblical nutrition, including the Maker's Diet. And I didn't realize that Ezekiel 47:12 and later in the Bible, Revelation 22, verse 2, which says, "The leaves are for the healing of the nations." Jordan Rubin [00:14:58]: Could this be more than spiritual allegory? Could this be a physical truth that has been hidden in plain sight? And Ben, I took it at the ladder, and I began to study over 1500 fruit trees and order fruit tree leaves from all over the world. And when I say order, I mean call a mango orchard and say, "Can I buy some leaves?" Ben Greenfield [00:15:23]: I was going to say, is there like a fruittreeleaf.com or are you just basically organically hunting these down? Jordan Rubin [00:15:29]: Oh, hunting them down. Because what was interesting is that out of the top 25 herbs and spices, zero would be fruit tree leaves. This is literally thrown away, cast aside, ignored. But yet I believe it unlocks the key to cancer, longevity, and 68 other conditions or systems of the body that I've studied. And I began to procure these leaves. First, I was laughed at calling a mango orchard to bug them about buying some fruit tree leaves which aren't for sale because they're composted or hauled off and. And them sending me a FedEx envelope with some napkins in between these big green leaves was interesting enough, But I started to put this message to work. And because in Revelation 22, verse 2, it says the tree of life, which contains 12 fruits, the leaves are for the healing of the nations. Jordan Rubin [00:16:28]: I combined 12 fruit tree leaves. Some are very familiar, some are exotic. And I made what you would call a tea or a decoction. But because there's no green, black, or white tea. It's more specifically called an herbal infusion. And that's what I did. And I noticed, Ben, even though I am blessed to be healthy now, I noticed some subtle improvements in joints, in skin. But it got really exciting when I was faced with a young man sitting in front of me in Kenya. Jordan Rubin [00:17:06]: He was from the Netherlands, asking me to pray for him as he was battling terminal cancer. He had a sarcoma of the femur. He was 6'2", 110 pounds, I'm guessing, wasting away, lost his hair, looked as white as a ghost. And in my carnal mind, or I'll say in the natural, I believed I would pray for this boy, and if he didn't do something drastically different, he was going to die. I've seen it dozens of times before. He was wasting away, emaciated, and when I prayed with him and his parents, he was in tears. And then he offered a simple prayer that was a combination of weeping and screaming where he yelled out, "God help me!" And I've gotta tell you, Ben, I've said a lot of long prayers in my life, but I may have never heard the most sincere, desperate prayer, which were three words: "God help me." Jordan Rubin [00:18:08]: Now, I want to fast forward a little bit because this story gets really interesting, but I felt led to not only pray for this young man, but as his parents asked me, "Can I help him with his health?" Even though I was fighting thoughts of, they live in the Netherlands, I'm in the United States, do they have the products I would recommend? Do they have the foods? Can they even get my book? But all of that seemed to work out and over WhatsApp. In the course of, I want to say 90 to 120 days, this young man went from emaciated and sick, undergoing chemotherapy, to telling the oncologist, they are quitting chemotherapy and God's going to heal them. And by the way, the oncologist said, "We've heard this many times before. And everyone who said it is dead." They said, "You are committing suicide." And they said to his parents, his name was Jethro, his parents, they said, "You are killing your son. If you go off conventional treatment and you come back to us, which you will, we likely can't save your leg or save your life." And I'll spare all the amazing details for time's sake, but over the course of 90 to 120 days, Jethro was healed, healthy and whole, cancer free. Jordan Rubin [00:19:33]: And in an amazing twist of I'll say destiny, ended up becoming a foreign exchange student living with me in Tennessee during COVID—you can picture all this. He left at 6'4", 200 pounds, ready to share his story with the world. And it's just an exciting testament to believing God's word, believing in his creation, that he gave us everything we need for healing. And Ben, the craziest part, he was the second person perhaps ever—other than me—to consume what I now call healing leaves. And his doctors, who once said he was committing suicide, said they have never seen a result like this before, where his PET scan was lit up like a Christmas tree with metastatic cancer and a tumor in his leg the size of a baseball. Now cancer free. And I have since shared it with about 40 to 50 others. And really today we're sharing it with the world and soon in The Biblio Diet. Jordan Rubin [00:20:42]: And I have made a decision to devote a big portion of my life to getting this message out there. Because ultimately, Ben, healing leaves taste like black tea or green tea. The poorest people in the world have the greatest access to fruit tree leaves. Most people have them in their backyard or their local forest. And there's no 12 leaves that you need. Any 12 leaves from fruit trees will do. And I have seen—first and secondhand—miracles from consuming this beverage that I hope will be on everybody's kitchen table, everybody's morning routine, everyone's pantry and cupboard. And best of all, if you're someone who calls on the name of the Lord and believes He is your savior, then this is going to glorify God in a huge way. Jordan Rubin [00:21:34]: So I am beyond excited. And that is why I made a personal call to you and said, "Ben, I really would be honored if we could share this with your audience," because you have shared many amazing biohacks, many amazing remedies, superfoods, and supplements. But I can tell you there is nothing on earth that God calls the healing of the nations other than fruit tree leaves. And for that reason, plus some pretty cool science, I'm going to shout it from the rooftops every chance I get. Ben Greenfield [00:22:07]: I have so many questions and honestly, I don't care if we don't get to any other part of the book except this. I definitely want to focus in on this because I think it's the most unique thing that you and I have talked about recently. Let's put the science hats on and talk about the proposed mechanism of action behind this. Like what is going on biochemically in terms of the composition of a fruit leaf that makes you suspect that it's having some type of an anti cancer or a cytotoxic effect to cancer cells? Jordan Rubin [00:22:36]: Well, it's a great question. And fortunately there has been some data on fruit tree leaves, even though there has been a lot less than turmeric and ashwagandha and all of these cool herbs that people are so excited about. But if you look into fruit tree leaves, most of them contain 60 to 300 different compounds. And some of them are more familiar than others, by the way—and I'm not talking about orange, apple and banana only. This is expanded to nuts. It's expanded to fruits that only natives have consumed that are not commonly commercialized. So I'm literally talking about oak trees, walnut trees, hazelnut trees, because nuts are fruits as well, along with aronia berries and things like persimmon and pawpaw. Jordan Rubin [00:23:28]: I call them America's forgotten superfoods. Of course, soursop or graviola, which has been a little bit popular for its anti-cancer benefits. What about olive and grape? But to answer your question, in the leaves you find compounds that are antimicrobial, antiparasitic, -fungal, -viral and -bacterial. They lower blood sugar, they boost immunity, and reduce inflammation with all of the nutrients found in fruits and none of the sugar. And some of these include ellagic acid and other ellagitannins. So we've heard of urolithin A and there's other urolithins, ellagic acid found in walnut leaf, raspberry leaf and pomegranate leaf, along with many berry leaves, contributes to health in many ways. Number one, and in no particular order, it helps balance blood sugar by shuttling glucose into muscles and out of circulation to prevent insulin insensitivity and body fat deposition. So it is a muscle booster. Ben Greenfield [00:24:36]: I may interrupt you a few times as you go through this, but it sounds to me so far I've heard two things, Jordan. The first is that it sounds like you're a believer in the terrain hypothesis of cancer. That when you say something is antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, controls mold, mycotoxins, et cetera. That one of the reasons that people get cancer is because their internal environment is ridden with virus, bacteria, mold, fungi, et cetera. Essentially they've weakened their ability to be able to fight off cancer due to a poor terrain. Am I following you correctly on that? Jordan Rubin [00:25:13]: I believe that that is definitely a component. And in fact, I think all of those areas—inflammation, weakened immune system, and certainly microbial imbalance—and in fact, I think you and I and many others have seen a litany of testimonials for those who are undergoing cancer treatment or a cancer diagnosis they're battling using traditional antiparasitic, which are really immune modulating off-market drugs like ivermectin and mebendazole and even the animal or veterinary dewormer, fenbendazole and fruit tree leaves actually contain similar benefits to animals and humans as those antiparasitics. And in fact, Ben, we give fruit tree leaves to our water buffalo, cattle, to our sheep and to our goats in lieu of dewormers. So there's absolutely that component. And ellagitannins, one compound in fruit tree leaves can be not only contributory to balancing blood sugar, but also they in and of themselves can be antiparasitic and antifungal and, but also ellagitannins or ellagic acid can cause apoptosis in cancer cells, which is natural programmed killing or programmed cell death. So in cell lines, ellagic acid from walnut, raspberry and pomegranate can cause a destruction of cancer cells. And this is just the beginning. Jordan Rubin [00:26:49]: I mentioned oak trees. Ben, you might not know this, but quercetin, which is a powerful flavonoid, is not only found in fruit tree leaves, but it was named after its inclusion in oak tree leaves, which is of the quercus genus. So oaks are quercus this or quercus that, depending on if it's a red oak, a white oak, et cetera. So quercetin is another compound. And really the list goes on and on. There's chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, gallic acid. There's hydroxytyrosol in olive leaves. There's oleuropin and other compounds. Jordan Rubin [00:27:29]: The list goes on and on. And what's great about fruit tree leaves is that there are common phytonutrients in similar fruit tree leaves, but there's also very unique compounds that you would find in a mango leaf that you wouldn't find in a blueberry leaf. However, odds are if you combine 12 fruit tree leaves that are somewhat dissimilar, meaning you don't want to have all stone fruits like apricot, peach, cherry, plum, because they're going to have more similar compounds. You want variety, if at all possible. And that's what we've done on our farms and in The Biblio Diet, particularly chapter 14, Healing Leaves, which you're referring to. We give people a list of leaves, we help people forage for leaves. Because, Ben, you're going to hopefully get off this podcast treadmill and you would find 12 leaves on your property through a little plant finder or herb finder app. And you could be drinking healing leaves in an hour, if not making healing leaves kombucha, which would take a little longer. Ben Greenfield [00:28:42]: Yeah, I actually want to ask you about this whole idea of 12 leaves, but before I do, the second thing I was going to say related to the onset of cancer and mechanism of actions that based on the insulin sensitizing aspects of some of these leaves. I'm guessing you also believe in this metabolic theory of cancer, that cancer cells particularly engage in heptiglucose utilization and lactic acid production, and that by somehow limiting the amount of glucose available to cancer cells or improving insulin sensitivity, we might be able to control that; hence, why there's so many recommendations for people who have cancer to limit glucose, sugar, and starches and consider even more of like a ketogenic approach. Jordan Rubin [00:29:23]: Absolutely. And what's great, Ben, is that by consuming fruit tree leaf tea prior to a meal, it severely restricts postprandial glucose increase, which is simply saying if you wear a CGM and you test your blood after a meal, if you've consumed healing leaves tea, if you want to call it that, you will have a blunted blood sugar spike and you're going to get all those other benefits that we already mentioned. It is amazing for metabolism, would be amazing for weight loss. And I think as crazy as this sounds, calling it an answer to cancer only greatly restricts its utility. Because I've seen three people in the last few months drink strictly mulberry leaf tea, and that's one of our favorite healing leaves of the Bible. They have either reduced or completely eliminated insulin. And these are long term—I don't like to say diabetics because I don't like to label people—but people who are battling diabetes over the long term, and two of them had a mulberry tree or bush in their backyard. Jordan Rubin [00:30:37]: They literally went in their backyard, pulled leaves off a tree, put them in water, heated it up, consumed it every day, and now they are either off or on a greatly reduced insulin intake. Amazing. Ben Greenfield [00:30:51]: And I like that it's kind of cheap. I get called out a lot for the, "Ben, I got to buy $100,000 hyperbaric cold infusion, you know, hydrogen unit to pull this off?" So, you know, planting trees is not expensive. It's still beyond what a lot of people like to do, which is just pop pills. But you've got some other—a couple of the practical things that you mentioned. You said 12 leaves. Ben Greenfield [00:31:14]: Are we—are you saying that I need to go to 12 different fruit trees and select 12 different leaves and combine them? Are you saying each time I make tea, I just use 12 leaves of whatever tree? Jordan Rubin [00:31:27]: It's a great question. I believe there's more power in the 12 different fruit tree leaves because again, if you look at Revelation, chapter 22, verse 2, it's similar to Ezekiel. It talks about a sanctuary, a river, but in this case, it talks about the Tree of Life. And Ben, for us Bible geeks, the Tree of Life was meant to provide eternal longevity. And listen, a lot of our friends and colleagues are trying to live to 120 or beyond. But when Adam and Eve sinned and got kicked out of the Garden of Eden, you probably remember there were cherubim that guarded the Tree of Life so that man could not reach his hand out and live forever. That is right out of Scripture. I can also tell you another time how the fall of man or man's sin is causing the destruction of our planet. Jordan Rubin [00:32:23]: And what some refer to as climate change is all part of that curse of man. And we are in the process of proving that that can be reversed through. I'll say this is going to sound heavy to some of your listeners, but the blood of Jesus and him taking those keys back and reversing that curse. So I am walking proof and living proof that we can rebuild our bodies and the planet. And it's kind of in the same methodology of planting these fruit trees. And that's exactly what we've done. But to answer your question, I prefer 12 different fruit tree leaves, like Revelation 22, two mentions, because there are 12 fruits on the Tree of Life. And I do think you'll get benefits from consuming one or two leaves. Jordan Rubin [00:33:14]: But when I work with people, and it's almost always severely ill people, I recommend 12 different fruit tree leaves. And I've been making this for people from my own leaves for the last several years. So that, I think is the most powerful array of phytonutrients or phytochemicals in those 12 fruit tree leaves. Ben Greenfield [00:33:36]: Okay. So for a guy like me, because I live on 12 acres, I've already— Jordan Rubin [00:33:38]: —Perfect number there, Ben— Ben Greenfield [00:33:40]: —apple. Yeah. Cherry, peach, apple and pear. And I could take like my Plant Snap app on my phone. I could walk around and look at a few other plants, identify whether or not they would fit into the category of trees. Let's say I identify eight more. So I'm harvesting those leaves and systematically kind of creating this tea on a daily basis. And I want to talk about the tea shortly. Ben Greenfield [00:34:03]: But let's say somebody lives in a highly urban environment. Is there a place that they could go—and let's say they don't want herbicides and pesticides and crap on their leaves where they could literally just order leaves of 12 different kinds? Jordan Rubin [00:34:16]: Yeah, you would want to go to one of those herbal companies. There's Mountain Rose herbs, there's Starwest. These are kind of bulk herb companies. And you can piece that together. Unsurprisingly, Ben, because I planted 600,000 fruit trees, we are working on creating products out of healing leaves and have been for years. They're not currently available, but if someone wants more information on the types of leaves we recommend and perhaps where to find them, The Biblio Diet book will have it and it's available for order. However, we are giving away, Ben, that chapter 14 you referenced for free to anyone who wants to log on to thebibliodiet.com so we have a download of chapter 14, Healing Leaves. Jordan Rubin [00:35:04]: It's free and it'll give a little more insight into the benefits, the health conditions that we believe healing leaves can help you fight. And some of our top leaves to find. But if you do a simple search, you can find a majority of fruit tree leaves, from strawberry to blackberry to blueberry to bilberry to soursop and many other species. But in your case, Ben—and I have not been to your home—I'm guessing you also have some evergreens, perhaps like juniper, which is from the cedar family, and pine. Many species of pine produce fruit. Juniper produces berries. Those two are amazing additions to healing leaves, even though their leaves are less leaf-like and more needle like. Ben Greenfield [00:35:55]: Okay, okay, got it. You mentioned this tea. So let's say I get my leaves, I'm going to make this tea. What's the best way to make the tea? And remember, we're talking to people who don't have like two hours in the kitchen. They want the fastest, easiest way to consume these things. Jordan Rubin [00:36:10]: The easiest way is to just make it like a loose leaf tea where you put the leaves—and the ratio that I recommend is usually 1 tablespoon of dried leaves for each of the 12. Grab a pot. I would like to say a 2 and a half quart pot, but think of a pot where you make spaghetti. So you're gonna fill it with water. You're gonna put either a tablespoon of each of 12 leaves or more if they're fresh. The dried leaves will crunch into about 12 tablespoons. Don't worry if you overdo it, no big deal. Jordan Rubin [00:36:41]: And you wanna bring the water to a boil with the leaves in it, pour it through a colander after you let it simmer for a little bit. And I make two weeks at a time. So I literally will go in with a big old stock pot and I will fill it to the top with lots of water and leaves. I will bring it to a boil, I will simmer it for 12 minutes, I'll let it cool down and then I fill, Ben, 8 half gallon jars with it. And that's where I pour my healing leaves and my family's every day for two weeks. Now, if you want it even simpler, just put leaves in a glass, boil some water, pour it over the glass or mug where the leaves are, wait a few minutes till it gets to be a tolerable temperature, and drink it just like you would tea. Ben Greenfield [00:37:35]: That doesn't sound too hard, especially if you do it as a batch. You said dried though. So if I go and harvest all these leaves, can I just lay them out in the sun on a towel? Do you use a food dehydrator? An oven at low temperature? Does it matter? Jordan Rubin [00:37:49]: Any of the above. So Jethro, who is the young man who overcame cancer when I started working with him, it was September in the Netherlands. He went to an orchard, picked a bunch of leaves and dried them in his oven with a pilot light on low. And then they went and bought a food dehydrator. You could do not pilot light, pilot setting, but you can do any of the above. Obviously, if you want to dry them outside, make sure it's truly dry. And you're going to maybe have some insects around, but it should be minimal. They don't attract bugs the way that fruit or anything sweet would. But any of those ways would be fine. Jordan Rubin [00:38:25]: And in the summer, which we're talking right now, in the summer, while you've got a few more days of growing time where you are in the Pac Northwest, you can just pick them off the trees and put them right into the water and boil them. But yes, save some for the winter. It will be well worth it. Ben Greenfield [00:38:44]: All right. bengreenfieldlife.com/biblio I'll link to the book, my other podcast with Jordan, and some of these recommendations: B-I-B-L-I-O. Jordan, can we talk about some other parts of your book? Jordan Rubin [00:38:55]: Yes. How about the Wisest Meal on Earth that will debunk some major health myths. Ben Greenfield [00:39:02]: The Wisest Meal on Earth? Jordan Rubin [00:39:03]: The Wisest Meal on Earth. There's three amazing revelations that I had since I've written the other biblical health books that for some reason were hidden for me and I remember I was walking on my farm in Tennessee and I said to Todd, our farm director, as we were talking about the new Biblio diet project, which I was working on, I said, you know, Todd, I think there's a chapter in the Bible that talks about exactly what King Solomon ate every day. So I went back, and sure enough, I Kings, chapter four, lists out Solomon's daily provisions. Now, Solomon, for those of you who don't know, was King David's son and known by God as the wisest man who ever lived and the richest man who ever lived. In fact, historically, it was said that all the kings of the world sat at the feet of Solomon and were amazed at his knowledge of science and humans, and the world. So this is a man who was given so much wisdom. He knew about plant life, animal life, and humans and what he ate every day with all the money in the world, literally, people came and brought him riches and treasures, and I think they've estimated his wealth as a quadrillionaire. Jordan Rubin [00:40:30]: It's more than anyone has today. Ben Greenfield [00:40:32]: People could take the deep rabbit hole, dive down Google and Reddit on this. Apparently he had ships going all the way to South America, and we find, like, Hebrew inscriptions in, like, the Amazon. And so he was likely bringing stuff from all over the world, like, you know, cinnamon, gold, myrrh, frankincense, like, you name it, from, like, probably one of the busiest shipping routes at his time. Jordan Rubin [00:40:56]: Yes. And he had an inner circle or a court that ate with him every day. And what he was feeding them and consuming was primarily meat and bread. Ben Greenfield [00:41:09]: You just, like, isolated and offended two big, big groups of the dogmatic nutrition world. Meat and bread. Jordan Rubin [00:41:15]: So some people have said for a long time that meat will kill you and kill the planet because cows are emitting greenhouse gases and all the other stuff. And then, of course, now there's a pretty thriving carnivore eating community that says plants are trying to kill you. Ben Greenfield [00:41:33]: Plants, including bread. Jordan Rubin [00:41:35]: Including bread. And then others that don't think plants are trying to kill you think bread's trying to kill you. And they've written books like Wheat Belly and Grain Brain. So I'm not arguing that the research done by these doctors doesn't have a little bit of merit or a lot of merit. But what I don't argue is that the word of God trumps science. And in this case, King Solomon ate grass-fed cattle. And I'm going to chop some more boots, Ben. He ate stall-fed cattle. Jordan Rubin [00:42:05]: Now, I'm not saying they were confinement animals that were Injected with hormones and antibiotics and fed glyphosate rich grain. But they were fed in a stall. Whether it was hay or grain or herbs, I don't know—grass fed cattle, ,stall-fed cattle, meal and flour that would be grain and bread and choice fowl as well as wild deer and roebuck. And it didn't say he ate this occasionally. These were Solomon's daily provisions. But while I'm at it, I believe that meat is one of the quintessential biblical superfoods, particularly red meat. Because anytime anyone could afford it or anytime anyone had an esteemed guest, they killed what was known as the fatted calf, which would have been an intact bull between four of six years of age. Jordan Rubin [00:42:59]: And Ben, here's something else that'll blow your mind. That intact bull where they consumed the meat called the fatted calf, would have provided actual testosterone and testosterone precursors to men and women, contributing to fertility and youth. Ben Greenfield [00:43:18]: You mean in the actual meat? Like you don't have to eat the testicles? Jordan Rubin [00:43:21]: In the actual meat. And I have getting down a little bit of a, I'll call it a water buffalo trail, not a rabbit trail. But I have a son who plays college football and for an entire off-season I fed him only food from water buffalo. We raise water buffalo. And I had a couple of mature bulls slaughtered, butchered and prepared. And he ate two pounds a day of water buffalo bull meat. And he gained in one off season, 65 pounds. Now, some people on the call don't want to gain 65 pounds, but the point is— Ben Greenfield [00:44:02]: —I'm assuming that's both fat mass and fat-free mass— Jordan Rubin [00:44:05]: —it was all of it. But his strength went up 25%. Record numbers. You just wouldn't believe it. He went in as a freshman as arguably the strongest player up against 6th year college students with a Covid year. And my son, I have one biological son and five adopted children. My son's genetics, from myself and Nikki, involve probably a 12-inch vertical leap and not a whole lot of body mass. So I'm just giving... Jordan Rubin [00:44:36]: ...yeah, just giving you an example that if you look into Scripture, into the Bible, you don't have to look so deep to find some of the greatest longevity-boosting, health-promoting secrets known to man. And if you think people look the same way in the Bible as they do today, you're wrong. Because obesity was so rare that it was mentioned every time someone was fat or obese. They called it out in the Bible because it was so abnormal. Ben Greenfield [00:45:08]: Yeah, I noticed that. It seems a little rude, but yeah, they do. Famous for all time and the best-selling book of all time for being fat. Jordan Rubin [00:45:15]: Exactly. The, the king of Eglon had apparently, rolls that when he was stabbed with a sword, you couldn't even see the butt of the sword because of his fat rolls. And then there is a couple of other references, like Eli, who was the priest before Samuel, he leaned back in a chair and they said he was so fat the chair broke. But outside of that, it was very rare. Ben Greenfield [00:45:40]: We should clarify, though, being fat is not synonymous with eating fat, because throughout the Bible, you find that God blesses people with fat of the land, you know, with honey, with milk, with bread. So nutrition and diet enrichment is often something that is a reward from God. It's the overconsumption of it, you know, the crossing over into gluttony, which becomes an issue. But the idea that there's not a lot of obesity in the Bible doesn't mean that eating fat is bad. And in fact, fat's kind of considered a blessing in the Bible. Jordan Rubin [00:46:10]: Well, Ben, my revelation number three, which didn't even make it in The Biblio Diet because the book was already written. This literally happened three weeks ago. And how somebody could read through the Bible consistently like I have for 15 years and miss anything related to food is beyond me. But this is so cool. Job, who was a man in the Bible that predated Moses and some of the other biblical luminaries, he was stricken with poverty. He went from being a wealthy, blessed man to losing his wealth. He lost his children, and he lost his health. And towards the end of Job, in chapter 29, Job is talking to God. Jordan Rubin [00:46:54]: In the longest conversation ever recorded between God and man. Amazing. It'll give you chills. Read the end of Job. God literally talks about his creation and says, more or less, Job, how dare you talk to me like this. I created the stars, the sky, the animals. I know where thunder is made and the factories where lightning is stored. Anyway, so cool. Jordan Rubin [00:47:16]: But this is how Job describes his previous prime of life, Ben. He said, in the prime of my life, cream poured out on the streets and olive oil welled out from a stone. So I believe that if Job described the prime of his life as a wealthy, blessed man being bathed and having all kinds of access to cream and olive oil, you better believe I want those two foods in my diet every day. The idea that our ancestors didn't eat a lot of meat and didn't eat a lot of fat is just not true. The only reason people wouldn't eat meat and fat is if they couldn't procure it, hunt it, or afford it, period. End of story. Everybody throughout history goes for the fattiest, most nutrient dense animal foods above all else. Ben Greenfield [00:48:14]: Yeah, comma, they also fasted a lot. Jordan Rubin [00:48:17]: Sure did. Ben Greenfield [00:48:18]: With the Wisest Meal on Earth—so you said it was meat, milk, and what was the third one? Jordan Rubin [00:48:22]: It was meat, bread and poultry. Ben Greenfield [00:48:25]: Sorry, meat. Jordan Rubin [00:48:25]: Pretty much. Ben Greenfield [00:48:26]: Okay, got it. What about the whole idea, like back to the elephant in the room, like the leaves and the fruits? Obviously you said the leaves are for healing, but then it does say in that verse that the fruits are for food. Do we find that Solomon placed an emphasis on like berries, pomegranates, mangoes, some of these fruits that seem to have a lot of pretty nutrient dense properties. Jordan Rubin [00:48:46]: I can't confirm that Solomon did, but we know that David, we know that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and many biblical I'll say ancestors consumed fruits like olives, grape, figs, dates, pomegranate. In fact, Ben, this is so cool. Pomegranate was known as the royal fruit of the Bible back in biblical times. And the Average pomegranate contains 613 seeds or arils. You know, those little delicious seeds with juicy fruit around them. Ben Greenfield [00:49:20]: Yeah, I believe you haven't counted them, but I believe you that is the. Jordan Rubin [00:49:23]: Same number of commandments in the Old Testament of the Bible. How amazing is that? What are the odds? Ben Greenfield [00:49:30]: Huh? That's interesting. Okay, so kind of like the thing I'm asked a lot because it's no secret. I talk on the podcast, I'm a Christian and I believe the Bible. And then people say, well, you eat pork and shellfish, because I see you talking about Seatopia shrimp on your website and you occasionally show your wife's bone-in reverse-sear pork chop recipe. I think you probably know where I'm coming from, Jordan. I say, well, you can get clean versions of that stuff now, like pastured pork and shellfish that's been screened. But with you having written so much about the Bible-based diet, and I don't even remember if we talked about this last time or not, we might have. Ben Greenfield [00:50:12]: What's the deal with pork and shellfish? Jordan Rubin [00:50:14]: Well, Ben, you know that I want to be a gracious guest on your program and try not to disagree with you. Ben Greenfield [00:50:21]: I don't care if you offend me and my diet. Tell—tell me straight up. Jordan Rubin [00:50:24]: I think pork and shellfish and any derivatives of that should be avoided at all costs. That's how I've lived my life. And I remember, Ben, when I first was introduced to the concept of eating the way the Bible says. I read a book called God's Key to Health and Happiness by Reverend Elmer Josephson. This was one of three books I read in 1996 that changed my life forever. And Reverend Josephson was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer. He was a pastor, he was a God-fearing man and dedicated his life to serving God. And he more or less yelled at God with his terminal diagnosis and said, "God, you promised me in your word to live a long and abundant life. Jordan Rubin [00:51:10]: Why am I dying?" And Elmer Josephson heard God's voice say, "Because you haven't followed my commandments." And Elmer Josephson read Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14, which said, Pork and shellfish, I'm going to paraphrase, are detestable, the same way human excrement and filth would be detestable. And he ceased eating pork and shellfish. His book details how he was cured of stomach cancer and he tried to spend the rest of his life telling others that God's commandments are the same yesterday, today and forever. They may not determine your salvation. In fact, the old joke is, can you eat pork and shellfish and still get to heaven? Some of us might say yes, and you'll get there a lot sooner. But I do believe, Ben, understanding a lot about regenerative farming—I've done it for nearly 20 years... Jordan Rubin [00:52:07]: ...the anatomy of a pig as a monogastric, just like a rat, a skunk, a dog or a cat is not able to detoxify properly, not able to metabolize nutrients. And the idea that you can have a pig eat healthy things would mean 24/7 surveillance because a pig will eat tumors off of other pigs. And I always used to say this and it freaked people out. Elmer Josephson, in the book God's Key to Health and Happiness, observed an experiment where there were four pigs stacked vertically in cages and they only fed the top pig. And the others did just fine. I'll let you fill in the blanks. Same thing for shellfish. There are so many amazing meats and fish to eat. Jordan Rubin [00:52:55]: If you're somebody listening and you're following a paleo diet or a keto diet or a carnivore diet or an omnivorous diet, and you have not avoided pork and shellfish, you may benefit from doing so because of the toxins, microorganisms and more. And this is where, Ben I disagree with people from the Weston A. Price Foundation, a lot of the, I'll say evolutionary diet experts. And it's my story and I'm sticking to it. Ben Greenfield [00:53:24]: Okay, but you don't think that, like, with Levitical law based around hygiene, that in an era of modern hygiene, some of those things are no longer applicable? Like, you know, I don't want to be gross, but, like, if, you know, if a woman is on her period, you'd have to send her out of the village or the camp or whatever for a week because she's unclean. And now we've got modern hygiene and tampons, things like that. And in the case of pigs and shellfish, couldn't we just get cleaner versions of them? And the law that was once meant for good hygiene would no longer really be something we need to follow from a ceremonial standpoint? Jordan Rubin [00:54:02]: I do not believe so. I believe, based on science, that shellfish, for example, are the best purifiers of polluted waterways because they store toxins. People say, but oysters are high in metals. I just was on a podcast in Phoenix yesterday, and maybe it was the day before, and I really upset the host because she believes oysters are a great source of minerals. And I would agree, but the minerals include cadmium, mercury, lead, and arsenic. So, Ben, I do not believe that this particular principle in Scripture can be changed or improved based on hygiene. Believe me, I can go into details on a woman's uncleanness. I can explain that. Jordan Rubin [00:54:43]: And there's some cool elements to that as well, believe me, with fertility. But I do not believe that pork and shellfish are suitable to eat the same way. I don't believe dogs, cats and skunks are. But for some reason, people look the other way when it comes to pork because they don't want to give up their bacon. And I might be one of the only health experts that is pounding this drum, but for me and my house, we will not touch pork and shellfish. And it's not for spiritual reasons. It's not a kosher thing. They are not suitable for human consumption based on anatomy and physiology. Jordan Rubin [00:55:21]: And I've seen too many people cut those things out and get better to believe otherwise. Ben Greenfield [00:55:28]: Really interesting. Well, I'm a big self quant guy and it wouldn't be a huge sacrifice for me because right now, to be honest, totally honest, I have pork about once a month. I have shellfish about once a month. So I could cut it out and take labs and maybe see how I do over six months. I'm game to try it. Okay, I want to lightning round a few of the things that you Jordan, because I know we're running slightly short on time, but I want to touch on these: milk. Not all milk is created equal. Knowing what you know, having been in the industry as long as you've been in it, obviously milk is encouraged in the Bible. Ben Greenfield [00:56:01]: What kind of milk would be the healthiest for people to drink or to give to their kids and their family? Jordan Rubin [00:56:06]: The healthiest milk that you can find easily would be an A2 milk that is grass-fed and organic, preferably non-homogenized, that is available ben everywhere, including Costco, which is unbelievable to me. I'm so thrilled about that. But that's sort of the best milk that someone who wants to go to a store can buy. Now if you want to know the best, the best milk on the planet or dairy products, I would consume an A2 raw grass-fed organic dairy from an animal that produces milk that is naturally homogenized and metabolizes all of the carotenoids. Now I know you love sciency things so I'm going to throw that all out at you. But what I mean is raw milk from water buffalo, goat or sheep. Now we know that cow's milk, that's raw, which can be really good, the cream separates, it rises to the top and it turns yellow when the cows are eating grass in season because of the carotenoids. The reason being cows don't metabolize carotenoids very well. Jordan Rubin [00:57:17]: But a goat, sheep or water buffalo, I raise them so I know when they eat only pasture grasses, herbs, legumes and forbs, they produce naturally homogenized milk. The fat globules are very small and absorbable and the milk is always white even when they're eating June spring pastures. It's because they naturally metabolize the carotenoids and I believe you're getting downstream metabolites from these powerful components. So that would be the best-case scenario. It's what I do primarily. I want to say this though: Milk is a superfood in its right form or it could be a toxic plethora of junk. If you eat skim, I call it blue milk, skim milk that has been fortified, pasteurized, homogenized, even though it's skim, which is ridiculous and has all these traces of antibiotics and hormones. Ben Greenfield [00:58:20]: Yeah, A2, grass-fed. Everything aside, multiple studies show the majority of health benefits from dairy consumption come from full fat, not skim or fat free. So that alone is important to know. That wasn't too too lightning round. Jordan Rubin [00:58:33]: I know I'm not a lightning round. Ben Greenfield [00:58:35]: These next. I know you're such a depth of knowledge. I was reading on green med Info Sire G He puts out some pretty good information, but he did a pretty big takedown article on bread yesterday calling out not just gluten but lectin, herbicides, pesticides, opiates, the things that you've heard before. But Jordan, let's say someone wrote an article like that, yet they still said but if he can find the right kind of grain, you could skirt some of those issues. So if you were going to buy bread or get grain to make bread, what would you choose as your top go-to? Jordan Rubin [00:59:06]: My favorite bread is sourdough that is long-term fermented, made from an unhybridized grain like Einkorn. And for those of you who haven't heard of Einkorn, it's E-I-N-K-O-R-N. It's not anything to do with corn, the plant or grain. Einkorn is a biblical grain. It has never been hybridized, which means it's lower in gluten, higher in non-gluten proteins and less likely to cause allergies. Now we have bred all the wrong qualities into cows that produce milk and into wheat and barley and other grains. So I consume sourdough bread and by the way, Ben, I had Crohn's and colitis, one of the worst cases documented in history. And part of my recovery was raw cream and sourdough whole grain bread. Ben Greenfield [01:00:02]: So crazy because most doctors say you shouldn't even be sniffing that stuff. Jordan Rubin [01:00:06]: Nope. So I do. And you don't have to eat it. I mean, listen, Sayer is a very close friend of mine and colleague and I don't disagree that modern bread that you get in a grocery store is horrible. But the sourdough craze is on. And if you can make your own sourdough bread or buy it at a specialty or health food store, even people with gluten sensitivity can often tolerate it because the sourdough or fermentation process eliminates the gluten, virtually lowers the gliadin content which is causing the opioid effect that you are referring to. It doesn't have glyphosate and it is actually a great source of energy and nutrients. But you want to consume white bread. Jordan Rubin [01:00:52]: I'll tell you, the whiter the bread, the sooner you're dead because it is total garbage and you can leave it on your patio for 50 years. Ben Greenfield [01:00:59]: I'll give a shout out to Dr. Jeffrey Bland, you know, father of functional medicine. He's doing some cool stuff with Himalayan Tartary Buckwheat. Yes, he is another one that I found I do just fine with. And my wife uses a—I think it's a local red berry kind of ancient, unhybridized grain for our sourdough at home. And then we've got milk or goats, so you're making me happy, Jordan. Ben Greenfield [01:01:18]: All right, last one. People hear about the Bible and they think honey, you know, it's found all over in Proverbs, for example, and throughout the Old Testament. Let's say somebody's going to do honey. I'm assuming it's not the plastic teddy bear off the grocery store shelf. But what would you pick if you were going to throw honey in there along with the bread and the milk and the red meat, for example? Jordan Rubin [01:01:40]: You're getting all of us hungry. Ben, I like to say this when it comes to honey for culinary use or as a sweetener, look for unheated or raw and unfiltered. Those are the terms you want to look for. Ideally, the honey crystallizes a bit when you leave it at room temperature, which means that it hasn't been ultra-heated. If you want a therapeutic honey, I like honey that is from New Zealand. You've probably heard of Manuka honey. Ben Greenfield [01:02:10]: Dude, I love Manuka. We had a sponsor for a while and I've still got a pantry full of stuff. Manukura honey. It's so good. Jordan Rubin [01:02:17]: Absolutely. And probably my favorite, Melapana honey, which is found in South America. It's in Costa Rica, Central America. Those are made by stingless small bees. And that honey can be used as an eye drop to treat eye infections. It's great for upper respiratory infections. It is a very cool, super honey. And it never thickens. Jordan Rubin [01:02:39]: So those are examples. I've also tried a Madagascar honey, Ben, that is off the charts amazing. But you want unheated and unfiltered and you can use it as a sweetener. It's almost miraculous as a topical wound healer. And it is literally a medicine cabinet. We talk all about honey, milk, bread, even salt. We didn't cover in The Biblio Diet because if the Bible says something's good, I want to know why. And I want to teach people how to acquire the food and how to consume the food. Jordan Rubin [01:03:14]: Because after all, Ben, my two principles here are eat what God created for food, number one, and number two, eat food in a form that is healthy for the body. If you can do that, your nutrition will absolutely contribute to amazing health. Ben Greenfield [01:03:33]: I love it. And yeah, you've got cancer-fighting nutrition, like we talked about. Meats, veggies, fruit, dairy, spices, salts, oils. We didn't even crack into fasting and some of the daily eating plans in there. But the book for those of you watching is the Biblio Diet. I'll link to that. My other podcast with Jordan, his website, everything at BenGreenfieldLife.com/Biblio —B-I-B-L-I-O, where you can leave your questions, your comments, your feedback. Ben Greenfield [01:04:02]: Jordan, I love talking to you, man. I always learn—I would say at least five new things every time we chat. Jordan Rubin [01:04:07]: Well, I appreciate it, Ben. And I know that there are so many amazing technologies out there. I see some behind you and I incorporate a lot of cool hacks and biohacks. But I never allow myself to get too far away from the C reator and what he gave for our longevity, our metabolism, our pain, our brain health, and of course, fighting a disease that's cost us too many lives and too many loved ones and too many precious hours. And that's my passion, is really to see the planet healed, people fed and disease eradicated. Ben Greenfield [01:04:46]: Keep up the great work, brother. I love you.
